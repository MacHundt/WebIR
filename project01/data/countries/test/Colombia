40	the use of complex numbers is its bread and butter tool and this is based on the remarkable property of euler's formula to remain the same with those operations represent change i.e. differentiation and integration which permits to transform differential equation into an algebraic one. another remarkable property of euler's formula used in is that it is contituted by two terms one with the cosine waverform and another one separated by the so-called imaginary unit the sine waveform. the cosine waveform is identical for positive and negative values of the variable x it satisfies the condition a reason why it is called an even function on the other hand the sine wave is identical in shape for positive and negative values of the varible x but reversal in sign a reason why it is called an odd function. it is known how important two symmetries in quantum mechanics are reason why complex numbers are essential to it. euler's formula is a complex unit that contains both symmetries found in nature and unit is sort of symbol to differentiate them in that unit.
