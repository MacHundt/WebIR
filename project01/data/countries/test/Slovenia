50	according to benjamin creme christ is returning in everyday life of our planet. he's coming like world teacher for all humanity. different religions expected him by different names: christ messiah the fifth buddha krishna or the imam mahdi but his real name is maitreya. his priority are: ending poverty and teaching humanity right realationship. 
50	image:fem isa human anatomy image:male human anatomy in anatomy anus from latin nus ring anus is external opening of the rectum. closure is controlled by sphincter muscles. feces are expelled from the body through the anus during the act of defecation which is the primary function of the anus. most animals mdash from simple worms to elephants and humans mdash have a tubular gut with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. the anus plays a role in sexuality though attitudes towards anal sex vary and it is even illegal in some countries. the anus is also the site of potential infections and other conditions including cancer. the subject is often considered a taboo part of the body and is known by a large number of usually vulgar slang terms. the human anus is situated between the buttocks posterior to the perineum. it has two anal sphincters one sphincter ani internus the other sphincter ani internus these hold the anus closed until the need arises to defecate. one sphincter consists of smooth muscle and its action is involuntary the other consists of striated muscle and its action is voluntary. in many animals the anus is surrounded by anal sacs. when the rectum is full the increase in intrarectal pressure forces the walls of the anal canal apart allowing the fecal matter to enter the canal. the rectum shortens as material is forced into the anal canal and peristaltic waves propel the feces out of the rectum. the internal and external sphincters of the anus allow the feces to be passed by muscles pulling the anus up over the exiting feces. to prevent diseases of the anus and to promote general hygiene humans often clean the anus after emptying the bowels. a wash with a bidet or a wiping with toilet paper are often used to clear the anus fecal matter. the anus has a relatively high concentration of endings and is an erogenous zone. sigmund freud's theory of psychosexual development for example described an anal stage hypothesizing that toddlers derive pleasure from retaining and expelling feces. this is the source of the term anal and the derived derogatory vulgarism anal anal intercourse can be pleasurable for both the insertive partner and the receptive partner. for the receptive partner pleasure from anal intercourse is also thought to be related to the shared wall between the rectum and the vagina for females as well as the g-spot or prostate for males. for the insertive partner the tightness of the anus is often said to be a source of pleasure in penetrative anal sex. anal intercourse sometimes referred to as sodomy or buggery is a human sexual activity but is considered taboo in a number of moral and and in some jurisdictions continues to be a crime carrying severe punishment. anal sexual activity need not include penetration. the anus also plays an important role in facesitting coprophilia and anal-oral anal stretching can stimulate the nerves around the anus and can be considered pleasurable. care must be taken to maintain elasticity. lubricant is widely regarded as a neccessity in perfoming anal sex. during puberty as testosterone triggers androgenic hair growth on the body pubic hair begins to appear around the anus. although initially sparse it fills out by the end of puberty if not earlier. image:anus human anus. hygiene is important for good anal health and anal sex. washing a mild soap and water will keep anus clean. harsh soaps wiping vigorously with toilet paper can irritate the skin around anus making it itchy sore. the source of pruritus itching. care should be taken not to strip the anus of natural oils that keep the skin around the opening supple and elastic. penetration with a penis or sex toy can irritate or tear the inside of the anus. lubrication is often recommended to ease penetration. the risk of injury to the anal sphincter should be a concern which can lead on to lack of control of defecation and fecal incontinence. similarly if the anus is torn this can occasionally cause a fistula formation which can not only cause fecal leaking but also can be very difficult to treat. kegel exercises can improve the tone of the outer sphincter muscle. shaving trimming hair or brazilian waxing can clear the perineum of hair. anal bleaching is a process which phenomenon where the perineum which darkens over the  is lightened for a more youthful appearance. anal piercing is among the more extreme piercings and usually interferes with the function of the anus. anal cancer abscess warts fistula anal fissure and hemorrhoids among the diseases of

50	 equations of state attempt to describe the relationship between temperature pressure and volume for a given substance or mixture of substances. the ideal gas law shown below is one of the simplest equations of state. although reasonably accurate for gases at low pressures and high temperatures the ideal gas law becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures.
 using statistical mechanics the ideal gas law can be derived by assuming that a gas is composed of a large number of small hard sphere molecules with no attractive or repulsive forces. in reality gas molecules do interact with attractive and repulsive forces. in fact it is these forces that result in the formation of liquids.
 a major weakness of the ideal gas law is its failure to predict the formation of liquid. most other equations of state do predict the formation of a liquid phase. usually these equations are cubic in volume and when solved will have either one or three real roots. when there is one real root there is no liquid phase and the solution corresponds to the volume of the gas phase. when three real roots exist one solution corresponds to the gas phase and one to the liquid phase. the intermediate root is an artefact and has no real meaning.
 in the following equations the variables are defined as follows any consistent set of units can be used although si units are preferred:
 :v  molar volume the volume of  mole of gas or liquid
 :t  temperature k
 :r  molar gas gas constant .
  van der waals equation of state 
 :p   rt
 where a b and r are constants that depend on the specific material. they can be calculated from the critical properties as:
 proposed in  the van der waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law. in this landmark equation a is called the attraction parameter and b the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume. while the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. while the van der waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons it is now obsolete. other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate.
 although usually not the most convenient equation of state the virial equation is important because it can be derived directly from statistical mechanics. if appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the coefficients. in this case b corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules c to triplets and so on.
 :p  
 :r  ideal gas constant .
 introduced in  the redlich-kwong equation of state was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time. it is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form. while superior to the van der waals equation of state it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating vapor-liquid equilibria. although it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose.
 the redlich-kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the critical properties is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the critical properties.
 :p  
 :r  ideal gas constant .
 :alpha    .  .omega  .omega tr.
 where omega is the acentric factor for the species.
 :alpha  . exp-.tr
 in  soave replaced the term of the redlich-kwong equation with a function alphatomega involving the temperature and the acentric factor. the alpha function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials.
 :r  ideal gas constant .
 :alpha    .  .omega  .omega tr.
 where omega is the acentric factor for the species.
 the peng-robinson equation was developed in  in order to satisfy the following goals:
  the parameters should be expressible in terms of the critical properties and the acentric factor.
  the model should provide reasonable accuracy near the critical point particularly for calculations of the compressibility factor and liquid density.
  the mixing rules should not employ more than a single binary interaction parameter which should be independent of temperature pressure and composition.
  the equation should be applicable to all calculations of all fluid properties in natural gas processes.
 for the most part the peng-robinson equation exhibits performance similar to the soave equation although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials especially nonpolar ones.
