52	a prayer specifically a pious ejaculation recognized by eastern orthodox tradition as legitimate. impious variations include such expressions as christ on a stick referring apparently to popsickles--at least one such popsickle mold was actually manufactured and christ in a side-car. sometimes a middle initial is ascribed to jesus yielding jesus h. christ for which see. 
52	 earned value management is a project management technique for estimating how a project is doing in terms of its budget and schedule.
 earned value compares the work the project team has finished so far with the estimates they made in the beginning of the project. this gives a measure of how far the project is from completion. by extrapolating from the amount of work already put into the project the project manager can get an estimate on how much resources the project will have used at completion.
 this technique is based on the critical path concept. an alternative project performance measurement and management technique is critical chain which utilizes buffer management instead. the reason is that the earned value management method does not distinguish between the progress on the project constraint i.e. its critical chain from progress on the non constraints i.e. other paths in the project network. this can sometimes lead the project manager to expetite non-critical work at the expense of critical work in pursuit of better earned value measures resulting in delayed project completion. this is a case of local optimalization resulting from a lack of subordination of local measures to global measures.
 to apply earned value to a project the project manager needs the following primary data:
  a work breakdown structure wbs: a list of all tasks broken down in a hierarchical structure
  project master schedule pms: a gantt chart of what task will be done when and by who
  budgeted cost of work scheduled bcws or planned value: for every period the budgets of the tasks that were planned to be finished in this time unit
  budgeted cost of work produced bcwp or earned value: for every period the budgets of the tasks that actually finished in this time unit
  actual cost of work produced acwp or effort spent: for every period the actual costs of the work
  budget at completion bac: sumbcws the total budget we estimate to spend to complete the project
  total funding available tfa: the budget the client has committed to
  negotiated period of performance npop: the time period the client has agreed upon with the project manager
  planned period of performance ppop: the time period we think we can finish the project
  cost accrual ratio car: the total average cost per person per time unit
  forecast of remaining work fcst or current schedule: the work that still needs to be done after this time unit
 from this data the project manager can calculate
  the cost variance cv: bcws  acwp greater than  is good
  the schedule variance sv: bcwp  bcws greater than  is good
  the cost performance index cpi: greater than  is good
  the schedule performance index spi: greater than  is good
  the estimate at completion eac: sumacwp  bac  sumbcwp cpi an estimate of the budget spent at the end of the project

52	water is the most powerful agent of erosions it changes landforms. water picks up sands in a area and drops them in another area. in a stream water washes soil and rocks and mixed with them. the soil and rocks hit against other rocks or settle down in a specific area causes different landforms to form. on the beach strong waves hit hardly against rocks and sands this causes bits of rocks to break and being washed away by the wave. years and years after the rock can disappear or form a sea cave. wind is another powerful agent of erosion. wind blows away sands and takes them to another place. in deserts where there were lots of sands wind takes up many sands and blows against other rocks. like water this can also cause the rock to become smaller or disappear. 
52	linking the essens to the sadducees and in effect calling them sadducees is a major error. the essenes seem to have been spoken of as a third seperate sect after the pharises and the sadducees. in the sadducees article it says that the sadducees did not believe in an immortal soul and the essenes certainly did! i am no expert but felt this was something i had to mention here.

52	receptive aphasia in popular culture the protagonist of stephen king's novel duma key exhibited symptoms of a condition similar to receptive aphasia after suffering brain damage in an industrial accident. when trying to recall some words he would frequently substitute a synonym of a similar-sounding word such as trying to say chair but instead saying burn a synonym of char and friend a synonym of chum.
