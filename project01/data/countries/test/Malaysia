47	 the endomembrane system is the system of internal biological within cells that divide the cell into functional and structural compartments or organelles. prokaryotes do not have an endomembrane system and thus lack most organelles.
 the endomembrane system also provides a transport system for moving molecules through the interior of the cell as well as interactive surfaces for lipid and protein synthesis. the membranes that make up the endomembrane system are made of a lipid bilayer with proteins attached to either side or traversing them.
 the following organelles are part of the endomembrane system:
 the plasma membrane is a lipid bilayer membrane that separates the cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals into and out of the cell.
 the nuclear envelope is the membrane around the cell of the cell.
 the endoplasmic reticulum is a synthesis and transport organelle the endoplasmic reticulum is an extension of the nuclear envelope.
 the golgi apparatus acts as the packaging and delivery system for molecules.
 lysosomes are the digestive units of the cell. they utilize enzymes to break down macromolecules and also act as a waste disposal system.
 vacuoles act as storage units in some cells.
 vesicles are small membrane-enclosed transport units that can transfer molecules between different compartments.

47	 a exabyte is a unit of measurement in of approximately one million million million american quintillion
 because of irregularities in definition and usage of the kilobyte the exact number could be any one of the following:
   bytes   times  times  times  times  times  or . this is  times a petabyte. this is the definition used in computer science and computer programming
   bytes  or  .
 see integral data type.
 a zettabyte is  times an exabyte.
 as of  exabytes of data are almost never encountered in a practical context. for example the total amount of printed material in the world is estimated to be around a fifth of an exabyte. exabytes may also appear to be encountered if a computer's file system is corrupt and displaying incorrect file sizes. however one may hear of  exabytes or  times  of address space when discussing various bit architectures.
 to clarify the meaning  above the international electrotechnical commission iec a standards body in  defined new prefixes by combining the international system of units si prefixes with the word binary. thus meaning  is called by the iec a exbibyte eib and meaning  is called by the iec an exabyte. this naming convention has not as of  been widely adopted.
 exabyte is also the name used for a brand of digital tape cartridges from ncr corporation. of course no-one has yet made a cartridge capable of holding a true exabyte.

47	sumer although in these societies cosmology was fundamentally supernatural and the notion of aliens is difficult to distinguish from that of gods demons etc.. thinkers argue systematically for a universe full of other planets and vicariously possible extraterrestrial life were greek writers and 6th bce. ancient greek worked against the idea extraterrestrial life in one critical respect however: the geocentric universe championed by and codified by ptolemy priviliged and earth-life aristotle denied there could be a plurality worlds and seemingly rendered impossible. ptolemaic system became dogma and although the church never issued any formal pronouncement on the question of alien life at least tacitly the was heretical and dangerous to publicly support. early-modern . the church however could not contain the storm that accompanied the invention of the telescope and the copernican assault on geocentric cosmology. once it became clear that the earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe the extraterrestrial idea moved toward the scientific mainstream. william herschel the discoverer of uranus was one of many 18th-19th astronomers convinced our solar system and perhaps others would be well populated by alien life. other luminaries of the period who championed cosmic pluralism included voltaire and benjamin franklin. at the height of the enlightenment even the sun and moon were considered candidates for hosting aliens. the christian attitude toward extraterrestrials turned from denial to ambivalence. theological criticisms had been partially stalemated by a critical counter-argument: to deny that god could and did create off-earth lifeforms was on some level a denial of his omnipotence. this enthusiasm toward the possibility of alien life continued well into the 20th century. indeed the roughly three centuries from the scientific revolution through the beginning of the modern era of solar system probes were essentially the highpoint for belief in extraterrestrials: many secular thinkers at least some religious thinkers astronomers of all stripes and much of the general public were largely satisfied that aliens were a reality. this trend was finally tempered as actual probes visited potential alien abodes in the solar system. the moon was decisively ruled out as possibility while venus and marslong the two main candidates for extraterrestrialsshowed no obvious evidence of current or past life. the other large moons of our system which have been visited appear similarly lifeless though interesting geothermic forces observed ios volcanism europa's ocean titan's thick atmosphere has underscored how broad the range of potentially habitable environments may be. finally the failure of nasa's seti program to detect anything resembling an intelligent radio signal after four decades of effort has partially dimmed the optimism that prevailed at the beginning of the space age. thus the three decades preceding the turn of the second millenium have saw a crossroads reached in beliefs in alien life. the prospect of ubiquitous intelligent space-faring civilizations appears increasingly dubious to many scientists all we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters in the words of seti's frank drake. at the same time the data returned by space probes and giant strides in detection methods have allowed science to begin delineating habitability criteria on other worlds and to confirm that at least extrasolar planets are plentiful though aliens remain a question mark. amongst the general public belief and interest in extraterrestrials remains high and scientific scepticism toward galaxy-exploring alien civilizations is not shared by many devotees. have also been attributed actions extraterrestrials. peer-reviewed microbial
