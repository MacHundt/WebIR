8	the main concept of class amplifier is  to decompose the mathematical model of the active device into two parts which are easier to work with and then  to eliminate the loss of the each part separately. the active switching device such as a transistor or mosfet can be modeled as a linear combination of two parts:  a theoretical element and  a complex network of parasitic elements attached to it capacitors inductors and resistors. after the decomposition it becomes trivial to eliminate the losses of each part:  the perfect switching element should be switched on during zero-voltage crossing and should be switched off during zero-current crossing. thus the switching element either conducts current or some non-zero on but never both at the same time. because the dissipated power is equal to x voltage becomes zero. this can be arranged by adjusting the phase capacitor and dc bias resistor of the signal going into the transistor input.  the parasitic elements can be tuned one by one by matching them to another passive element with the complex conjugate impedance. in theory the only remaining the parasitic resistors in the system which cannot be avoided. class on. it is still an active area of research and new variants appear from time to time usually with the letters e and f somewhere in class name.
