49	when the internal combustion engine was invented the term motor was initially used to distinguish it from the steam enginewhich was in wide use at the time powering locomotives and other vehicles such as rollers. motor and engine later came to be used interchangeably in casual discourse. however technically the two words have different meanings. an mcgraw hill 
49	information in thermodynamics and information uncertainty when viewed in terms of information theory the entropy state function is simply the amount of information in the shannon sense that would be needed to specify the full microstate of the system. this is left unspecified by the macroscopic description. in information theory entropy is the measure of the amount of information that is missing before reception and is sometimes referred to as shannon entropy.balian roger . entropy  protean concept pdf. poincar seminar : pp.  shannon entropy is a broad and general concept which finds applications in information theory as well as maximum entropy it was originally devised by claude shannon in  to study the amount of information in a transmitted message. the definition of the information entropy is however quite general and is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities :mathhx  sumin pxi log in the case of transmitted messages these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average amount of information in a message. for the case of equal probabilities i.e. each message is equally probable the shannon entropy in bits is just the number of questions needed to determine the content of the message.ref the question of the link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is a debated topic. while most authors argue that there is a link between the twocite and information namegeorgescu-roegen cite entropy law and the economic university physical foundation of economics  an analytical thermodynamic a few argue that they have nothing to do with each other. shu-kun. . diversity and entropy. entropy journal  pp.  the expressions for the two entropies are similar. the information entropy h for equal probabilities mathpi  p  is :mathh  k where k is a constant which determines the units of entropy. for example if the units are bits then k  the thermodynamic entropy s from a statistical mechanical point of view was first expressed by boltzmann: :maths  kmathrmb where p is the probability of a system's being in a particular microstate given that it is in a particular macrostate and is boltzmann's constant. it can be seen that one may think of the thermodynamic entropy as boltzmann's constant divided by log times the number of questions that must be asked in order to determine the microstate of the system given that we know the macrostate. the link between thermodynamic and information entropy was developed in a series of papers by edwin jaynes beginning in .cite t. jaynes  bibliogr there are many ways of demonstrating the equivalence of information entropy and physics entropy that is the equivalence of shannon entropy and boltzmann entropy. nevertheless some authors argue for dropping the word entropy for the h function of information theory and using shannon's other term uncertainty instead.schneider tom delila system deoxyribonucleic acid library language information theory analysis of binding sites laboratory of mathematical biology national cancer institute fcrdc bldg. . rm  p.o. box. b frederick md  usa 
49	in the fifth chapter of the quran the table laden with food  named after this miracle of jesus god narrates how the disciples of jesus requested him to ask god to send down a table laden with food and for it to be a special day of commemoration for them in the future. when the disciples said: o jesus son of mary! is your lord able to send down for us a table spread with food from heaven? he said: observe your duty to god if ye are true believers. they said: we desire to eat of it and our hearts be at rest and that we may know that you have spoken truth to us and that we may be witnesses thereof. jesus son of mary said: o god our lord send down for us a table laden with food out of heaven that shall be for us a recurring festival the first and last of us and a miracle from you. and provide us our sustenance for you are the best of providers! quran :- since the occasion was to be for us a recurring festival it is likely the last supper also called the lord's supper breaking of bread eucharist or communion. the eucharist has always been at the center of christian worship 
49	pdf ovision.pdf?aspdf however political voting seems to be far more prevalent among eastern european countries and other more minor nations that have produced few if any internationally renowned and acclaimed artists. in contrast countries with a history of producing blockbuster music acts that achieve worldwide fame and success such as the uk sweden and ireland have faired poorly in the last decade. famous acts from those countries seem reluctant to take part in a competition that is widely regarded in the leading western music nations as irrelevant shallow and embarrassing which may also explain the poor showing of acts from these countries in recent times. 
49	belief in extraterrestrial life may have been present in ancient egypt babylon and sumer. the first important western thinker to hit upon the idea of inhabited worlds was the ancient greek writer thales and his student anaximander. the atomists of greece took up the idea arguing that an infinite universe ought to have an infinity of populated worlds. the cosmology of aristotle which placed the earth at the center of the universe seemed to work against the idea of extraterrestrial life and when christianity spread through the west the idea became a heresy. the best known pre-modern proponent of extra-solar planets and widespread life off earth was giordano bruno who was burned at the stake for this and other unorthodox ideas in . at present
