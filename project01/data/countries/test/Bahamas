76	ecologists long known to detractors as have long argued over whether the evil entity known as bran was evil or not. bran is known to have killed countless small children and during the paleolithic the deaths of neoconservatives led some ecologists to believe that it was only killing the wicked but it was later learned that most of the neocons were pursuing a straw man political tactic and were actually liberals. a fine example of this is ann coulter who pretended to be a neoconservative for a number of years before being gunned down by a bran operative. in light of this recent evidence most scholars now firmly believe that it is evil and must be destroyed by garlic or burning in order to the slow the coming of the antichrist.
