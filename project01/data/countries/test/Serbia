33	the essenitial point of pauling electronegativity is that there is semi empirical formula for dissociation energies namely: matherm drm ab sqrterm drm aa erm drm bbchirm a  chirm b this is an approximate equation but holds with good accuracy. pauling obtained it by noting that bond can be approximately represented as a quantum mechanical superposition of covalent bond and two ionic bond-states. the covalent energy of a bond is approximately by quantum mechanical calculations geometric mean of the two energies of covalent bonds of the same molecules it is approximately equal to the aritmetic mean as the energies are of the similar value but geometric mean is more accurate and does always give positive excess energy due to ionic bonding and there is an additional energy that comes from ionic factors i.e. polar character of the bond. the square root of this excess energy pauling notes is approximately additive and hence one can introduce the electronegativity. thus it is this semi-empirical formula for bond energy that underlies pauling electronegativity concept. the formulas are approximate but this rough approximation is in fact relatively good and gives the right intuition with the notion of polarity of the bond and some theoretical grounding in quantum mechanics.
