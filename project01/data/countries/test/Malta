34	 charlie spencer chaplin walworth london england april    vevey switzerland december   was the most famous actor in early hollywood cinema and later also a notable director. his principal character was the tramp--a lower class character with a tight coat oversized pants and shoes a derby hat a wooden cane and his signature square mustache.
 chaplin was one of the most creative personalities in the silent film era. he directed acted wrote his stories and was even known to write his movie scores.
 born in a poor contest ? context? in  he started his artistic career as a music hall performer a clown in fred karno's mumming birds company. with karno he visited the us in  and here met mack sennett who let join his keystone studio.
 in  he founded the united artists studio with with mary pickford douglas fairbanks and david griffith.
 his salary history suggests how rapidly he became world famous.
  : keystone worked for  a week
  : essanay  a week plus  signing bonus
  : mutual  a week plus  signing bonus
  : first national a million dollar deal  the first actor ever with such a high price tag.
 although talkies movies with sound became the dominant mode of moviemaking soon after they were introduced in  chaplin resisted making a talkie all through the 1930s. it is a tribute to chaplin's versatility that he also has one film credit for choreography for the  film limelight and one credit as a singer for the title music of the  film the circus.
 his first sound picture the great dictator  was a brave act of defiance against adolf hitler and fascists everywhere. chaplin played a fascist dictator clearly modeled on hitler also with a certain phisical likeness and at the same time a jewish barber cruelly persecuted by the nazis.
 although chaplin had his major successes in the united states he refused to accept u.s. citizenship he was born in britain and proudly retained his british nationality. during the era of mccarthyism chaplin was accused of unamerican activities and his lifelong enemy j. edgar hoover who had instructed the fbi to keep extensive files on him tried to remove his residency rights.
 in  in fact chaplin left the united states for a trip to england hoover learned about it and negotiated with the ins that his reentry permit would not be honored. chaplin decided then to stay in europe and made his home in switzerland with his wife oona o'neil. he returned briefly for an award ceremony in .
 charlie chaplin never won an academy in the normal way. although he did receive an oscar for the best music in an original dramatic score for the  film limelight this did not happen until . because of chaplin's difficulties with mccarthyism the film did not open in los angeles when it was first produced. this criterion for nomination was not fulfilled until .
 chaplin did however win the honorary award twice. when the first oscars were awarded on may   the voting audit procedures that now exist had not yet been invented and the categories were still very fluid. when it became apparent that chaplin who had been nominated for best actor and best comedy direction would fail to win either award for his movie the circus the academy decided to give him a special award for versatility and genius in acting writing directing and producing the circus. the other film to receive a special award that year was the jazz singer.
 chaplin's second honorary award came  years later in  and was for the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century. he came out of his exile and collected his award less than a month before the death of j. edgar hoover. chaplin was also nominated without success for best picture best actor and best original screenplay for the great dictator  and again for best original screenplay for monsieur verdoux .
 his latest work was a countess from hong kong  starring sophia loren and marlon brando.
 charlie chaplin died december  . two months later his corpse was stolen from the cemetary in switzerland in an attempt to extract money from his relatives. the plot failed the robbers were captured and the corpse returned.

34	 cryptology is an engineering discipline informed by telecommunications engineering practice the communications theory aspects of information theory see shannon and weaver mathematical theory of communication univ of ill press about  and shannon's articles in ? in the bell system technical journal on communications secrecy and by the theory of computational complexity. the field is not a science in that questions of practicality and cost-effectiveness predominate in actual practice and experimental testing is wholly conditioned on tester resources. except in the sense that some proposed algorithm or protocol may be shown to be insecure under current conditions eg the cryptanalytic tools computational capability funding and staff available to an attacker there is no opportunity to perform experimental tests of hypotheses about cryptopgraphic assertions. cryptology is concerned with communications in secure and often secret form. cryptology is often taken as a synonym for cryptography and occasionally for cryptanalysis as well but specialists in the field have for years adopted the convention that cryptology is the more inclusive term encompassing both cryptography and cryptanalysis. the word is sometimes ascribed to william friedman of the us army's signal intelligence service in the 30s. however some writers prefer to use cryptography as the overall term.
 the term is derived from the greek hidden and word. note that encompasses much more than mere secrecy. cryptographic security may result when and only when well chosen algorithms and protocols are properly used these intentions may include authentication of the participants to each other with or without secrecy integrity checks of messages sent also with or without secrecy and of course secrecy of the message sent against the non-intended. in most instances secrecy obtains when legitimate users the sender and the receiver are able to transform information into a ciphertext by use of an encryption algorithm in all modern cases controlled at each invocation by one of many possible cryptographic keys  i.e. a piece of information which customizes the operation of the encryption algorithm. for a large class of such algorithms the key is known to both users and must not be known by any other. although the cipher should be inscrutable and unforgeable to anyone without this secret key and good ones correctly used will be the authorized receiver can either decrypt the cipher to recover the hidden information or verify that it was sent in all likelihood by someone possessing the key.
 much is frequently confused and misused in discussions of cryptography. readers are warned that there is much irresponsible and poorly informed but authoritatively stated information available on the subject. terms often confused with unfortunate consequences on understanding are code and cipher. even experts occasionally employ these terms as though they were synonymous.
 crypto is a common abbreviation for cryptology.

34	 de:entscheidungsproblemthe entscheidungsproblem german: decision problem is the challenge in symbolic logic to find a general algorithm which decides for given first-order predicate order statements whether they are universally valid or not. alonzo church and independently alan turing showed in  that this is impossible. as a consequence it is in particular impossible to algorithmically decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false.
 the question goes back to gottfried leibniz who in the seventeenth century after having constructed a successful mechanical calculating machine dreamt of building a machine that could manipulate symbols in order to determine the truth values of mathematical statements. he realized that the first step would have to be a clean formal language and much of his subsequent work was directed towards that goal. in  david hilbert and ackermann posed the question in the form outlined above.
 a first-order statement is called universally valid or logically valid if it follows from the axioms of the first-order predicate calculus. goedels completeness completeness theorem states that a statement is universally valid in this sense if and only if it is true in every interpretation of the formula in a model.
 before the question could be answered the notion of algorithm had to be formally defined. this was done by alonzo church in  with the concept of effective calculability based on his lambda calculus and by alan turing in the same year with his concept of turing machines. the two approaches are equivalent an instance of the church-turing thesis.
 the negative answer to the entscheidungsproblem was then given by alonzo church in  and independently shortly thereafter by alan turing also in . church proved that there is no algorithm defined via recursive functions which decides for two given lambda calculus expressions whether they are equivalent or not. he relied heavily on earlier work by kleene. turing reduced the problem to the halting problem for turing machines and his paper is generally considered to be much more influential than church's. the work of both authors was heavily influenced by kurt goumldels earlier work on his goedels incompleteness theorem especially by the method of assigning numbers to logical formulas in order to reduce logic to arithmetic.
 turing's argument follows. suppose we had a general decision algorithm for first order logic. the question whether a given turing machine halts or not can be formulated as a first-order statement which would then be susceptible to the decision algorithm. but turing had proved earlier that no general algorithm can decide whether a given turing machine halts.
 it is important to realize that if we restrict ourselves to a specific first order theory with specified object constants function constants predicate constants and subject axioms the truth of statements in that theory may very well be algorithmically decidable. an example of this is given by presburger arithmetic.
 however the general first-order theory of the natural numbers expressed in peanos axioms cannot be decided with such an algorithm. this also follows from turing's argument given above.

34	 the epistle to ephesians is one of the books of the bible
 in the new testament. it
 was written by paul at rome about the same time as that to the
 epistle to the which in many points it resembles.
 the epistle to the colossians is mainly
 polemical designed to refute certain theosophic errors that had
 crept into the church there. that to the ephesians does not seem
 to have originated in any special circumstances but is simply a
 letter springing from paul's love to the church there and
 indicative of his earnest desire that they should be fully
 instructed in the profound doctrines of the gospel. it contains
  the salutation :   a general description of the
 blessings the gospel reveals as to their source means by which
 they are attained purpose for which they are bestowed and
 their final result with a fervent prayer for the further
 spiritual enrichment of the ephesians :-:  a record
 of that marked change in spiritual position which the gentile
 believers now possessed ending with an account of the writer's
 selection to and qualification for the apostolate of heathendom
 a fact so considered as to keep them from being dispirited and
 to lead him to pray for enlarged spiritual benefactions on his
 absent sympathizers :-:  a chapter on unity as
 undisturbed by diversity of gifts :  special
 injunctions bearing on ordinary life :-:  the
 imagery of a spiritual warfare mission of tychicus and
 planting of the church at ephesus
 paul's first and hurried
 visit for the space of three months to ephesus is recorded in
 acts :-. the work he began on this occasion was carried
 forward by apollos  and aquila and priscilla. on his
 second visit early in the following year he remained at
 ephesus three years for he found it was the key to the
 western provinces of asia minor. here a great door and
 effectual was opened to him  cor. : and the church was
 established and strengthened by his assiduous labours there
 acts : . from ephesus as a centre the gospel spread
 abroad almost throughout all asia :. the word mightily
 grew and prevailed despite all the opposition and persecution
 on his last journey to jerusalem the apostle landed at
 miletus and summoning together the elders of the church from
 ephesus delivered to them his remarkable farewell charge acts
 : expecting to see them no more.
 the following parallels between this epistle and the milesian
 charge may be traced:
 . acts :  eph. :. the phrase lowliness of mind
 . acts :  eph. :. the word counsel as denoting
 the divine plan occurs only here and heb. :.
 . acts :  eph. :. the divine ability.
 . acts :  eph. :. the building upon the foundation.
 . acts :  eph. : . the inheritance of the
 place and date of the writing of the letter
 written from rome during paul's first imprisonment : :
 : and probably soon after his arrival there about the year
  four years after he had parted with the ephesian elders at
 miletus. the subscription of this epistle is correct.
 there seems to have been no special occasion for the writing
 of this letter as already noted. paul's object was plainly not
 polemical. no errors had sprung up in the church which he sought
 to point out and refute. the object of the apostle is to set
 of the faithful in christ. he speaks to the ephesians as a type
 or sample of the church universal. the church's foundations
 its course and its end are his theme. everywhere the
 romans paul writes from the point of view of justification by
 the imputed righteousness of christ here he writes from the
 point of view specially of union to the redeemer and hence of
 the oneness of the true church of christ. this is perhaps the
 profoundest book in existence. it is a book which sounds the
 lowest depths of christian doctrine and scales the loftiest
 heights of christian experience and the fact that the apostle
 evidently expected the ephesians to understand it is an evidence
 of the proficiency which paul's converts had attained under his
 relation between this epistle and that to the colossians
 the letters of the apostle are the fervent outburst of
 pastoral zeal and attachment written without reserve and in
 unaffected simplicity sentiments come warm from the heart
 without the shaping out pruning and punctilious arrangement of
 a formal discourse. there is such a fresh and familiar
 transcription of feeling so frequent an introduction of
 coloquial idiom and so much of conversational frankness and
 with every paragraph and the ear seems to catch and recognize
 the very tones of living address. is it then any matter of
 amazement that one letter should resemble another or that two
 written about the same time should have so much in common and so
 much that is peculiar? the close relation as to style and
 subject between the epistles to colosse and ephesus must strike
 every reader. their precise relation to each other has given
 rise to much discussion. the great probability is that the
 epistle to colosse was first written the parallel passages in
 ephesians which amount to about forty-two in number having the
 appearance of being expansions from the epistle to colosse.

34	 the eureka stockade was a civil revolt in  in victoria australia by gold miners against the officials supervising the gold-mining regions of ballarat. although the revolt failed it has endured in the collective social consciousness of australia. it is popularly characterised as the birth of democracy within the fledgling nation.
 victoria was declared a separate colony from new south wales in  and for the first  years of its existence was a peaceful and sparsely populated region of farmers and graziers. this was disrupted irrevocably in  with the discovery of substantial gold fields all across the territory resulting in a rapid and massive influx of fortune-hunting immigrants.
 the roots of the eureka stockade lie in the inadequacy of the infantile governmental institutions to cope with the social changes and pressures of such a change in the demography of the colony. from being the administrative body of the rural aristocracy the government suddenly found themselves in charge of an unruly population of itinerants and were hopelessly unprepared. the response was to impose an unofficial martial law enforced by the hurriedly assembled and quasi-military gold commission. additionally and justified or not the authorities of victoria were deeply associated with the deeply hated english oppression from which many of the miners had left their homelands to escape.
 within a short period of time the easy surface gold has been exhausted and gold could only be found by digging for the deep leads  the veins of gold buried beneath metres of clay and rock. by  the fields of ballarat were occupied by  or more miners from britain ireland europe and china many of which had come to australia from the gold fields of california and the hills has been denuded of trees to provide timber for the deep shafts being dug.
 authority in the camps was held by the resident gold commissioner robert rede and enforced by a military garrison. the main mechanism of government revenue was the miners licence  a short term lease of a claim a . metre plot of land. the monthly fee for this licence was  shillings  a stupendous fee for the time  and was payable whether or not any gold had actually been found. this obviously raised the ire of the miners as did the weekly licence hunts where the military police searched for and arrested anyone lacking proof of a licence.
 in september  prompted primarily by budgetary shortfalls chiefly caused by the cost of maintaining a private army the governor of victoria sir charles hotham ordered the frequency of the licence hunts to twice weekly. with dissent simmering this and two further events drove the miners to violence.
 the next catalyst was the arrest of a crippled non-english speaking armenian for assaulting an officer it was later admitted by the authorities that this arrest was wrongful. this angered the miners on several grounds. first it was seen as victimisation on racial grounds although it was certainly not expressed in such 20th century terms. this was probably not enough to motivate the miners as they were not exactly renowned for their racial tolerance. they did identify with the armenian on the grounds of his being a digger  a term synonymous with the lack of privilege. however the man arrested was also the servant of a roman catholic priest father smyth and this was interpreted as a religious insult by the enormous irish miner population who already held deep resentments against the british for religious oppression.
 the second catalyst was the acquittal of the publican james bentley who had been charged with the murder of a miner james scobie. this was interpreted as a lack of justice and in early october  an angry mob burnt the bentleys hotel to the ground.
 civil and non-violent protests began to be organised at the perceived injustices on sunday october   a crowd estimated at more than ten thousand miners gathered at bakery hill directly opposite the government encampment. although this crowd made camp for over a week no violence ensued however neither were their grievances heard by the authorities. a second mass meeting occurred on wednesday november  at which the ballarat reform league was created under the chairmanship of j. b. humffray. throughout the next month the league sought to negotiate with commissioner rede and governor hotham both on the specific matters relating to bentley and the men being tried for the burning of the hotel and on the broader issues of abolition of the licence democratic representation of the gold fields and disbanding of the gold commission.
 commissioner rede's response to these disputes was perhaps an ill-judged one but stem from his military background and has been attributed by many historians most notably manning clark to his belief in his right to exert empirical authority over the rabble. rather than hear the grievances rede increased the police presence in the gold fields and summoned reinforcements from melbourne. a crisis was henceforth imminent.
 on november  reinforcements marching from melbourne were attacked by a mob with a number being injured and a drummer boy allegedly killed. at a meeting the following day november  the reform league relayed their failure to achieve any success in negotiations with the authorities. most notably a blue flag bearing nothing but the southern cross ie. the union jack of great britain had been deliberately excluded was flown for the first recorded time. this meeting resolved to openly rebel by burning the hated licenses and resistance to the authorities.
 rede responded by ordering a large contingent of police to conduct a licence search on november . although  defaulters were arrested most of the military resources available had to be summoned to extricate the arresting officers from the angry mob that had assembled.
 this raid prompted a breakdown in the leadership of the reform league and in the rising tide of anger and resentment amongst the miners a more militant leader peter lalor took control. in swift fashion a military structure was assembled with brigades formed and captains appointed. licences were burned the rebel eureka flag unfurled and oaths of allegiance were sworn. an encampment at the eureka flat was set up and by friday december  a ramshackle stockade was in existence assembled from timber and overturned carts. the miners vowed to defend themselves from licence hunts and harassment from the authorities.
 although the scene was set for a great military encounter rede did nothing and as a result the passion and vehemence of the miner's lost steam. by late in the evening of saturday december  many miners had returned to their personal camps and were getting on with the business of mining or traditional saturday night carousing. a small contingent of two to three hundred miners remained at the stockade.
 rede's inaction thus far did not reflect his true intent and at  am on sunday december   a party of  police and military personnel under the command of captain j. w. thomas approached the eureka stockade and a battle ensued.
 there is no agreement as to which side fired first however what was clear was that the battle was fierce brief and terribly one-sided. the ramshackle army of miners were hopelessly outclassed by a military regiment and were quickly routed. estimates are that  miners died inside the stockade and an uncertain number of others may have died outside. many miners fled and a substantial number of survivors were arrested. martial law was imposed and all armed resistance collapsed.
 for a few weeks it appeared that the status quo had been restored and rede ruled the camps with an iron fist. however in melbourne and to a lesser extent sydney there was tremendous public outcry against the military actions. newspapers characterised it as a brutal overuse of force in a situation brought about by the actions of government officials in the first place and public condemnation became insurmountable. thirteen miners were tried for treason early in  and all were rapidly acquitted to great public acclaim. rede himself was quietly removed from the camps and reassigned to a position of insignificance in rural victoria.
 a commission of enquiry into the affair was organised and was scathing in its assessment of all aspects of the administration of the gold fields and particularly the eureka stockade affair. the gold licences were abolished and replaced by an export fee based on the value of the gold and an inexpensive annual miner's licence. a system of mining wardens replaced the gold commissioners and police numbers were cut drastically. the pace of reform was so rapid that within a year the rebel leader peter lalor was representing ballarat in the legislative council and a few years later was elected speaker of the legislative assembly of victoria.
 for the next thirty years people tried to forget the eureka stockade so much so that the precise location of the insurrection remains uncertain. all of the materials used to build the stockade were rapidly removed to be used for the mines and the entire area itself was extensively worked so that the original landscape has changed. however the event itself returned to the national consciousness and became a rallying cry as the call for independence from britain gained momentum in the 1880s.
 the eureka stockade or more accurately the driving force of public opinion that followed has been characterised as the birth of democracy within australia. it's precise significance is uncertain: it has been variously mythologised by the political left as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny and of labour against a privileged ruling class and by the political right as a revolt of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation as an expression of multicultural republicanism and so on.
 the affair continues to echo throughout australian politics to the present day and the call to replace the existing australian flag with the eureka flag has been raised on countless occasions by various groups within the country. while there is no doubt that the eureka stockade was one of the most significant events in australian history what the precise nature of that significance actually is will probably be argued about for a long time.

34	 convention adopted under the auspices of the council of europe to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. most council of europe member states are party to it those that are not are required as a condition of their membership to accede to the convention at the earliest opportunity.
 the official name of the convention is the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
 the convention has several protocols. this includes protocol six which prohibits the death penalty except in time of war. the protocols accepted varied from state party to state party though it is understood that state parties should be party to as many protocols as possible.
 the convention establishes the european court of human rights. any person who feels their rights have been violated under the convention by a state party can take a case to the court the decisions of the court are legally binding and the court has the power to award damages. state parties can also take cases against other state parties to the court although this power is rarely used.
 prior to the entry into force of protocol  individuals did not have direct access to the court they had to apply to the european commission on human rights which if it found the case to be well-founded would launch a case in the court on the individual's behalf. protocol  abolished the commission enlarged the court and allowed individuals to take cases directly to the court.
 as of late  twelve protocols to the covention have been opened for signature. we can divide these into two main groups: those changing the machinery of the convention and those adding additional rights to those protected by the convention.
 the convention has been amended several times by means of protocols attached thereto. these amendments have only ever effected affected? the convention machinery not the substantive content of the rights it protects. unlike the substantive protocols these protocols have achieved universal ratification among parties to the original convention. the protocols themselves required universal ratification to enter into force in order to maintain the institutional unity of the convention machinery.
 these protocols were protocol  ets  adopted  protocol  ets  adopted  protocol  ets  adopted  protocol  ets  adopted  protocol  ets   and most importantly protocol  ets  adopted -. protocol  ets  adopted  although it does not ammend the text of the convention as such stipulates that it is to be treated as an integral part of the convention and has been consolidated into the convention by protocol .
 protocol  established a fundamental change in the machinery of the convention. as noted above the comission was abolished and individuals were permitted to apply directly to the court. this also necessitated changing the structure of the court to support its new expanded role. protocol  also abolished all the judicial functions of the committee of ministers. protocol  also made necessary consequential ammendments to those protocols extending its substantive protections.
 the other protocols protocols     and  add substantive rights to those protected by the convention and will be discussed below after the discussion of those contained in the convention itself.
 article  protects the right of every person to their life. the article contains exceptions for the cases of lawful executions and deaths as a result of the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary in defending one's self or others arresting a suspect or fugitive and suppressing riots or insurrections. the exemption for the case of lawful executions is further restricted by protocol  see below for those parties who are also parties to that protocol.
 article  prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. the european court of human rights has held that this provision prohibits the extradition of a person to a foreign state if they are likely to be subjected there to torture.
 article  prohibits slavery and forced labour but it excepts conscription national service and prison labour from this prohibition.
 article  provides the right to liberty subject only to lawful arrest or detention under certain other circumstances such as arrest on suspicion of a crime or imprisonment in fulfilment of a sentence. the article provides the right to be informed in a language one understands of the charge against them the right to judicial proceedings to determine the legality of one's arrest or detention and the right to compensation in the case of arrest or detention in violation of this article.
 article  provides a detailed right to a fair trial. article  provides for the principle of nulla poena sine lege that there can be no punishment for behaviour which was not a criminal offence at the time of its admission. the article states that a criminal offence is one under either national or international law which would permit a party to prosecute someone for a crime which was not illegal under their domestic law at the time so long as it was prohibited by possibly customary international international law.
 article  provides a right to respect for one's private and family life his home and his correspondence subject to certain restrictions. this article clearly provides a right to be free of unlawful searches but the court has given the protection for private and family life this article provides a broad interpretation taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. this may be compared to the jurisprudence of the united states supreme court which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the right to privacy.
 article  provides a right to freedom of thought conscience and religion. article  provides the right to freedom of expression. article  protects the right to freedom of assembly and association.
 article  provides a right for men and women of marrigeable age to marry and establish a family. despite a number of invitations the court has so far refused to apply the protections of this article to homosexual marriage or issues of marriage and transsexuality. the court has defended this on the grounds that the article was intended to apply only to traditional marriage and that a wide margin of appreciation must be granted to parties in this area.
 article  provides for the right for an effective remedy before national authorities for violations of rights under the convention.
 article  contains a prohibition of discrimination. this prohibition is broad in some ways and narrow in others. on the one hand the article protects against discrimination based on any of a wide range of grounds. the article provides a list of such grounds including race sex religion and several other criteria and most significantly providing that this list is non exhaustive. on the other hand the article's scope is limited only to discriminate in rights under the convention. protocol  extends this prohibition to cover discrimination in any legal right even when that legal right is not protected under the convention so long as it is provided for in national law.

34	 franois-eugne prince of savoy-carignan also franz eugen in german october  april  . noted general.
 born in paris and a prince of the house of savoy eugene was the son of the comte de soissons a french nobleman. it was rumoured that he was the illegitimate son of louis xiv however and louis strove mightily to keep down his supposed by-blow. eugene was rebuffed from a commission in the french army and frustrated joined the austrian army as an officer in . he would spend the rest of his life opposing louis xiv and french ambition in europe.
 for the first part of his career he faced the ottoman turks on the battlefield first coming to prominence during the last major turkish offensive against the austrian capital of vienna in . by the closing years of the 17th century he was already famous for securing hungary from the turks and soon rose to the role of principal austrian commander during the war of the spanish succession.
 in the opening shots of that war he defeated french armies in northern italy. as the area of french offensive action moved north and as the war spread to include other nations such as england he joined forces for the first time with his english counterpart the duke of marlborough. together they defeated the french in bavaria at the battle of blenheim. for the next three years he was engaged in inconclusive fighting in northern italy and provence. he then moved north to flanders where he joined up with marlborough again to win the battles of battle of and battle of unfortunately the follow-up invasion of france that would have ended the war was blunted by the marginal victory of malplaquet and the retirement of britain from the war. after one more year of fighting austria signed a favourable peace with france in .

34	 the council regulation on the statute for a european company adopted october   official journal of the european l  pp.  contains rules for a european company called an se abbreviation for societas europaea latin for european company. an se can be registered in any of the  member states in the european union and the registration can be easily transferred to another member state. there is no eu-wide register of ses an se is registered on the national register of the member state in which it has its head office but each registration is to be published in the official journal.
 the  different member states of the european union have widely different company laws. this means that companies have to comply with many different regulatory systems and merger of companies from different states is often complex and difficult.
 ses can be created in the following ways:
  by merger of national companies from different member states
  by the creation of a joint venture between companies or other entities in different member states
  by the creation of a se subsidiary of a national company
  by the conversion of a national company into an se
 the regulation is complemented by the council directive complementing the statute for a european company with regard to the involvement of employees in the european company adopted october   official journal of the european l  pp. . the directive establishes rules on worker involvement in the management of the se.
 eu member states differ in the degree of worker involvement in corporate management. in germany most large corporations are required to allow employees to elect a certain percentage of seats on the board of directors. other member states such as the uk have no such requirement and furthermore in these states such practices are largely unknown and considered a threat to the rights of management. in states with these provisions the corporation has two boards a management board which handles the day-to-day operation of the company and the supervisory board which elects and oversees the management board and reports back to shareholders and employees. this division is effected in part to avoid direct involvement of employee representatives in day-to-day management. companies in states without worker involvement provisions tend to have unitary boards of directors instead.
 these differing traditions of worker involvement have held back the adoption of the statute for over a decade. states without worker involvement provisions were afraid that the se might lead to having such provisions being imposed on their companies and states with those provisions were afraid they might lead to those provisions being circumvented.
 a compromise contained in the directive was worked out as follows: worker involvement provisions in the se will be decided upon by negotiations between employees and management before the creation of the se. if agreement cannot be reached provisions contained in the directive will apply. the directive provides for worker involvement in the se if a minimum percentage of employees from the entities coming together to form the se enjoyed worker involvement provisions. the directive permits member states to not implement these default worker involvement provisions in their national law but then an se cannot be created in that member state if the provisions in the directive would apply and negotiations between workers and management are unsuccessful.
 two approaches have been attempted to solve this problem. one approach is to harmonize the company law of the member states. this approach has had some sucesses but after thirty years only limited progress has been made. it is difficult to harmonize widely different regulatory systems especially when they reflect different national attitudes to issues such as worker involvement in the management of the company.
 the other approach is to construct a whole new system of eu company law that co-exists with the individual company laws of the member states. companies would have the choice of operating either under national regulations or under the eu-wide system. however this approach has been only somewhat more effective than the harmonization approach: while states are not as concerned about having foreign traditions of corporate governance imposed on their companies which the harmonization approach could well entail they also wish to ensure that the eu-wide system would be palatable to the traditions of their national companies so that they will not be put at a disadvantage compared to the other member states.
 the european company statute represents a step in this direction albeit a limited one. while it establishes some common eu rules on the se these rules are incomplete and the holes in the rules are to be filled in using the law of the member state in which the se is registered. this has been due to the difficulties of agreeing on common european rules on these issues.
