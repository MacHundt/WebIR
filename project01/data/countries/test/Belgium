1	 an eclipse occurs when an astronomical such as a planet or natural gets between a source of light e.g. the sun and another body. for instance jupiter eclipses its natural when it gets between them and the sun.
 from earth's point of view eclipses can be:
  lunar eclipses  the earth obscures the sun from the moon's point of view. the moon moves through the shadow cast by the earth. this can only happen at full moon.
  solar eclipses  the moon obscures the sun from the earth's point of view. the moon casts a shadow that touches the surface of the earth. this can only happen at new moon.
 total eclipses occur where the light source is totally blocked off by the eclipsing body. for total solar eclipses the viewer is in the umbra part of the moon's shadow.
 partial eclipses occur at places where only part of the luminary is covered solar eclipses or when only part of a body is eclipsed by the shadow lunar eclipses. for solar eclipses the viewer is in the penumbra part of the moon's shadow.
 an annular eclipse is a total eclipse of luminary where a thin ring of light is visible around the intervening object. it is sheer coincidence that the moon and sun have nearly equal apparent sizes making annular eclipses possible. annular eclipses are ideal times for observing solar prominences.
 as seen from earth an eclipse can only occur when the sun earth and moon are in a line. because the plane of the orbit of the moon is tilted with respect to the plane of the orbit of the earth the ecliptic eclipses occur only when the three bodies are near the intersection of these planes: these are nodes. the sun passes either node once a year and eclipses occur in a period of about  draconic months around these times. there can be from  to  eclipses in a calendar year. they repeat according to eclipse cycles.
 the following web page lists many of the cycles over which solar and lunar eclipses repeat including the saros and inex :

1	 viollet le duc eugne emmanuel january 27th  paris france 
 french architect famous for his restorations of medieval buildings.
 in the early 1830s, a movement for the restoration of medieval buildings appeared in france. viollet le duc returning from a study trip to italy was ordered by prosper merime to restore vezelay abbey. this work marked the beginning of a long series of restorations.
 among his restorations we can find :
  sainte-marie madeleine vezelay
  notre dame paris
  saint denis paris
  saint louis poissy france
  saint-nazaire carcassonnes france
  saint-sernin toulouse france
  town halls :
 viollet-le-duc also applied the lessons of gothic architecture especially what he conceived of its structural systems to modern building materials such as cast iron. he practiced as archaeologically precise for his time a style of restoration as he could manage but his own designs were remarkably innovative. his approach to both medieval and modern architecture was severely rational in keeping with his own unsentimental appreciation of the gothic achievement.
 throughout his career he also kept taking notes and drawings not only on the buildings he was working on but also on roman gothic and renaissance buildings that were to be soon demolished. his study of medieval and renaissance period was not limited to architecture but extended to furniture clothing musical instruments armament
 all this work was published first in serial and then as full-scale books as :
  the dictionnary of french architecture from 10th to 15th century  dictionnaire raisonn de l'architecture franaise du xie au xve sicle
  the dictionnary of french furnishings  dictionnaire raisonn du mobilier franais de lpoque carolingienne  la renaissance.
 viollet-le-duc systematized his approach to architecture and architectural education in the entretiens sur l'architecture'  in  volumes  discourses on architecture.
