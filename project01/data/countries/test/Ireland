16	over two thousand years ago the babylonian king nebuchadnezzar destroyed the holy temple in jerusalem. the jewish people were driven out of israel and were forced to live in babylon. fifty years later babylonia was defeated by persia. xerxes was the second persian king. he ruled over the largest and strongest kingdom in the world. xerxes chose the city of shushan as his new capital. he had a feast to celebrate lasting for one hundred and eighty days for all the important people in the kingdom. he had a second feast lasting seven days and everyone in the city was invited including the jews. mordechai the leader of the jews warned his people not to go to the feast but they were afraid to disobey the king. they ate and drank to their hearts content. however they were troubled by the of the gold and silver vessels from the holy temple being used in the celebrations. xerxes boasted that his queen vashti was the most beautiful woman in the kingdom. on the final day of festivities he commanded her to come and dance for the crowd. vashti the proud granddaughter of nebuchadnezzar refused to appear in front of them. in a fit of rage xerxes had her banished from the kingdom. xerxes told his men to search the kingdom for someone even more beautiful than vashti. they went from house to house taking the young girls away to shushan where they were kept until they were brought before the king. in shushan hadassah a jewish orphan lived with her uncle mordechai. when the kings men came to her house mordechai told her to hide the fact that she was a jew and told her to give them her persian name: esther. esther was beautiful and kind. she remained in the palace for a year before the king saw her. as soon as she was brought before him he chose her as his new queen. esther appointed seven maidservants one for each weekday so she would know which day the sabbath fell on. her meals were cooked with kosher food. she kept her secret well and no one knew that she was a jew. everyday her uncle mordechai sat outside the palace gates to wait for news about her. one day while he was waiting outside the palace mordechai heard two men plotting to kill the king. he warned esther to tell her husband and the two men were caught and killed. although it was recorded in the royal book that mordechai the jew had saved the king people soon forgot. xerxes appointed haman the richest man in the kingdom as his new prime minister. all of the kings subjects were ordered to bow to haman. everyone obeyed this except esthers uncle mordechai. mordechai did not have any objection to honouring and bowing to haman but haman wore a large medallion engraved with the picture of an idol on his chest. mordechai said that people would think he bowing to the idol. haman was furious that mordechai refused to bow to him. he complained to the king. he asked for permission to destroy a group of people but he didnt tell the king that they were jews. xerxes gave haman his signet ring to seal the orders and decrees. haman was anxious not to make any mistakes so he drew lots purim to decide on the day. he sent out letters to each of the provinces in the kingdom telling people to kill the jews and take their property on the 13th day of the month of adar. when mordechai heard of the decree he was very upset and went to esther to ask her to go to the king and save the jews. esther was afraid because it was forbidden to come before the king without being invited. esther asked that the jews in shushan fast and pray for her for three days. when the three days of prayers and fasting were over esther went to the king and asked him to a banquet with haman. however when the king arrived and asked her what she would like esther invited him to a second banquet. haman felt very important because the queen invited him to a banquet so he decided to kill mordechai at the first opportunity without waiting for the 13th of adar. he built a gallows in his own courtyard to hang mordechai. the king could not sleep so he asked a servant to read him the book containing the historical records. the servant found out that in the records it said that mordecai was never honoured for discovering the conspiracy. haman was called in to advise the king on how to honour mordecai. haman thought that the king was referring to him so he said for the man whom the king wishes to honour let them bring royal attire which the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself has ridden  one bearing the royal insignia! then let this clothing and this horse be given to one of the kings noble officials. let him then clothe the man whom the king wishes to honour and let him lead him about through the plaza of the city on the horse calling before him so shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honour! the king told haman to organise a horse and robes for mordechai and to lead him around the city. the king went to esthers banquet. at the banquet esther accused haman of plotting to kill mordechai and the jews. she tells the king that she herself is a jew and begs him to spare her life and her peoples lives. the king went outside to think things over while he was gone haman tried to beg esther for forgiveness but when the king walks in he thought that haman was attacking esther. the king then had haman hung on the gallows that were intended for mordecai. mordechai became the prime minister in hamans place. according to persian law the king was not allowed to take back the order about the destruction of the jewish people because it was stamped with the royal seal. mordechai was given the royal signet ring to issue whatever new decrees he could think of to help save the jews. he issued a royal letter urging the jews to organise themselves and defend themselves on the 13th of adar. on the 13th of adar jews across the kingdom assembled and defended themselves. thousands of their enemies were killed including haman's  evil sons who were hanged from a tree. but in shushan the jews continued to fight for an extra day. on the 15th of adar the jews of shushan celebrated their victory. the jews celebrated their victory with feasts this ritual is now known as purim. esther was a woman of deep faith and patriotism. she risked her life to save her people from hamans decree by seeing the king without permission. she asked the jews in shushan to pray for her because she believed that god would look after her. she was an obedient adopted to she followed his orders even when she was afraid. esther appears the bible as a woman of deep piety faith courage patriotism and caution combined with resolution a dutiful daughter to her adopted father docile and obedient to his counsels and anxious to share the king's favour with him for the good of the jewish people. that she was raised up as an instrument in the hand of god to avert the destruction of the jewish people and to afford them protection and forward their wealth and peace their captivity is manifest from the scripture account. her name hadassah means myrtle in hebrew. comes from the hebrew for hidden describing what lengths she had take so that she wouldnt exposed.

16	to term this march a civil rights association march as a riot is unfair and unjust. differences must be made between the civil rights association and the i.r.a. while martin mcguiness second in command of the derry brigade was in the march the claims of ira sniper fire have never been proven. this was not an i.r.a sponsered march while members where among the marchers unquestionsbly this was a civil rights association march the i.r.a council had little or no authority over these marches to suggest that protesters in derry were all active i.r.a members is absurd. bloody sunday is considered in republican circles as the i.r.a s greatest advertisment for recruitment. the i.r.a as an organisation was not as powerful in  as it had been previously in  or as it became. the civil rights association basic demands were . an end to gerrymandering particularly evident in derry where the city with an evident catholic majoraty in  anywhere from  was governed though republicans claim ruled by a protestant council. . equal oppertunties for all not just catholics. the derry bogside was the most economically blighted area of derry which did not have the same heavy industry as belfast had throughout the 20th century. . in all the basic demand was one man one vote i don't think the article requires editing it is not particularly biased to one side it sticks to both sides of what is a disputed event he does not call the widgery report straight out a whitewash which it is considered in irish circles. exonerating british soldiers from any wrongdoing and calling the firing of over  live rounds into a built up area of apartment blocks at worst possibly wreckless the authuor of the article makes an account of the bloody sunday guns some of which turned up in little rock beiruit and sierra leone and the guns which were destroyed in the donnington armoury in the midlands of england. a fair article and in no way partisan 
16	the present inquiry into the events of bloody sunday has nearly  statements from people involved which seem to answer many of the questions raised here and are all available on the inquiry's website. it is acknowledged by the authorities that it's suspicious that no british soldiers were shot that day. it seems that the crowd were unarmed in that they were not carrying firearms but those who were rioting acknowledging that many at the riot were in the wrong place at the wrong time were throwing rocks. the witness statements are adamant that some of the people shot at were throwing nail bombs and that some were in buildings with firearms. an mi agent has provided evidence that martin mcguinness has claimed to have fired the first shot he denies this and in fact claims that he was nowhere near the shooting. no soliders admit to having fired into the crowd only to having fired at those with firearms and nail bombs and to have shot into the air above the rioters heads to attempt to disperse them. but the critical question remains whether these actions can account for all the deaths and i agree that it should be known as  rather than  as that's the number who died as a direct result of the shooting that day. 
16	the shooting of the kids in their backs is one thing. the lies deceit and fraud of the british state in covering all of this up for the past three decades is another. the confiscation of cameras and film rolls such as of that italian couple i don't know if the article mentions them the destruction of other incriminating evidence and the state whitewash that blamed the civil rights protestors for the massacre all of this and much more make this an extraordinarily ugly chapter. maybe lief in the us you can put forward the british case here. i guarantee you that when you do the board will be filled with editors presenting eyewitness accounts disproving the lies of the british state on bloody sunday. please put forward their defence. wikipedia is yours as well. for that matter to help you along here is the british state's current inquiry into you will have all of the eyewitness accounts of the survivors on that website. :  august  utc i think the link here is obviously that all those damned natives were terrorists just as all of their savage kind had been for centuries you see. and all those wonderful colonialists were only trying to civilise them on bloody sunday. ungrateful wretches those paddies. simple! :  august  utc
