eiffel implementation of multiple inheritance in the opinion of its supporters successfully meets these objections. eiffel's design is closely based on object-oriented programming oop theory with less

reliable and correct answers to computing problems. eiffel has only six basic executable instructions: unlike many object-oriented languages but similar to smalltalk eiffel does not permit storing into fields of other objects. the assignment instruction can only change the value of a field of the current object or a local variable of the current routine. all changes to other objects must be accomplished by calls to methods of that object. direct access to fields of other objects is read only in eiffel. the iteration loop instruction in eiffel does not provide a field or clause which will step the loop. the programmer must express the stepping as part of the loop. for example: from i :  until i   loop the example above also illustrates that eiffel treats arrays simply as instances of the class array providing access in the form of routine calls in line with object-oriented ideas. eiffel compilers optimize this access. eiffel's procedural coding is strictly structured. there are no instructions for exiting a loop or routine early. eiffel is a purely object-oriented language. any coding which must be close to the machine is expected to be done in c. eiffel provides a straightforward interface to c routines including allowing for straight c calls within eiffel code. eiffel is generally closely connected to c: three of the four eiffel compilers output no object or

software engineering ise since renamed eiffel software inc. eiffel closely follows dr. meyer's work in object oriented software construction second edition. eiffel differs from most popular languages in several ways. the goal of the language libraries and programing methods is to create reliable reusable software modules. it supports multiple inheritance genericity polymorphism encapsulation and parameter covariance. its most important contribution to software engineering is design by contract dbc in which assertions preconditions postconditions and class invariants are used to assist in assuring program correctness without sacrificing efficiency. eiffel also offers multiple class inheritance. many people such as the designers of java have objections to multiple inheritance. the eiffel implementation of multiple inheritance in the opinion of its supporters successfully meets these objections. eiffel's design is closely based on object-oriented programming oop theory with less influence from other paradigms or support for legacy code. the language has formal support for abstract data types. in accordance with self documentation a software text should be able to reproduce

reliable and correct answers to computing problems. eiffel has only six basic executable instructions: unlike many object-oriented languages but similar to smalltalk eiffel does not permit storing into fields of other objects. the assignment instruction can only change the value of a field of the current object or a local variable of the current routine. all changes to other objects must be accomplished by calls to methods of that object. direct access to fields of other objects is read only in eiffel. the iteration loop instruction in eiffel does not provide a field or clause which will step the loop. the programmer must express the stepping as part of the loop. for example: from i :  until i   loop the example above also illustrates that eiffel treats arrays simply as instances of the class array providing access in the form of routine calls in line with object-oriented ideas. eiffel compilers optimize this access. eiffel's procedural coding is strictly structured. there are no instructions for exiting a loop or routine early. eiffel is a purely object-oriented language. any coding which must be close to the machine is expected to be done in c. eiffel provides a straightforward interface to c routines including allowing for straight c calls within eiffel code. eiffel is generally closely connected to c: three of the four eiffel compilers output no object or

software engineering ise since renamed eiffel software inc. eiffel closely follows dr. meyer's work in object oriented software construction second edition. eiffel differs from most popular languages in several ways. the goal of the language libraries and programing methods is to create reliable reusable software modules. it supports multiple inheritance genericity polymorphism encapsulation and parameter covariance. its most important contribution to software engineering is design by contract dbc in which assertions preconditions postconditions and class invariants are used to assist in assuring program correctness without sacrificing efficiency. eiffel also offers multiple class inheritance. many people such as the designers of java have objections to multiple inheritance. the eiffel implementation of multiple inheritance in the opinion of its supporters successfully meets these objections. eiffel's design is closely based on object-oriented programming oop theory with less influence from other paradigms or support for legacy code. the language has formal support for abstract data types. in accordance with self documentation a software text should be able to reproduce its design documentation from the text itself. eiffel accomplishes this by using a formalized implementation of the abstract data type. eiffelstudio an integrated development environment for eiffel

intentionally limits stylistic expression providing few means for clever coding tricks or coding techniques intended as optimization hints to the compiler. some software developers feel constrained by eiffel's simplicity and compiler-enforced structure the language has been referred to as a bondage and discipline language. in contrast others feel that the simplicity of the language not only makes the code more readable but also allows a programmer to concentrate on the important aspects of a program without getting bogged down in implementation details. eiffel's simplicity is intended to promote simple readable usable reusable reliable and correct answers to computing problems. eiffel has only six basic executable instructions: unlike many object-oriented languages but similar to smalltalk eiffel does not permit storing into fields of other objects. the assignment instruction can only change the value of a field of the current object or a local variable of the current routine. all changes to other objects must be accomplished by calls to methods of that object. direct access to fields of other objects is read only in eiffel. the iteration loop instruction in eiffel does not provide a field or clause which will step the loop. the programmer must express the stepping as part of the loop. for example: from i :  until i   loop the example above also illustrates that eiffel treats arrays simply as instances of the class array providing access in the form of routine calls in line with object-oriented ideas. eiffel compilers optimize this access. eiffel's procedural coding is strictly structured. there are no instructions for exiting a loop or routine early. eiffel is a purely object-oriented language. any coding which must be close to the machine is expected to be done in c. eiffel provides a straightforward interface to c routines including allowing for straight c calls within eiffel code. eiffel is generally closely connected to c: three of the four eiffel compilers output no object or machine code but only c source code as an intermediate language to submit to a c compiler for optimizing and portability. eiffel was originally developed by bertrand meyer and his company interactive software engineering ise since renamed eiffel software inc. eiffel closely follows dr. meyer's work in object oriented software construction second edition. eiffel differs from most popular languages in several ways. the goal of the language libraries and programing methods is to create reliable reusable software modules. it supports multiple inheritance genericity polymorphism encapsulation and parameter covariance. its most important contribution to software engineering is design by contract dbc in which assertions preconditions postconditions and class invariants are used to assist in assuring program correctness without sacrificing efficiency. eiffel also offers multiple class inheritance. many people such as the designers of java have objections to multiple inheritance. the eiffel implementation of multiple inheritance in the opinion of its supporters successfully meets these objections. eiffel's design is closely based on object-oriented programming oop theory with less influence from other paradigms or support for legacy code. the language has formal support for abstract data types. in accordance with self documentation a software text should be able to reproduce its design documentation from the text itself. eiffel accomplishes this by using a formalized implementation of the abstract data type. eiffelstudio an integrated development environment for eiffel offers an object-oriented interface for software engineering. however many programmers dislike it because its user interface is very different from other integrated development environments. there are two alternative open source implementations smarteiffel  the gnu implementation and visual eiffel which provides a more traditional interface. so does eiffelenvision a plugin for microsoft visual studio which allows users to edit compile and debug eiffel apps from within the microsoft visual studio ide. eiffelstudio and eiffelenvision are only free for non-commercial use though. the first great steps have been done by bertrand meyer who initiated the eiffel nice consortium to standardize the language and base libraries. as time passed on b. meyer moved from eiffel nice to ecma perhaps because he and his company eiffel software inc. counts more there. on the  june  the european computer manufacturers association ecma approved the first international standard for eiffel ecma standard  eiffel analysis design and implementation language this standard is not accepted by the complete eiffel community and especially the smarteiffel team has decided to fork the language because they think the ecma standard throws away important principles of the original language. most notable differences are:  smarteiffel is case-sensitive and this behaviour can no longer be turned off  no access to variables within a c-class. only return-values of functions are accessible from within smarteiffel the standard cites the following as earlier eiffel language specifications: bertrand meyer: eiffel: the language prentice hall second printing  first printing:  bertrand meyer: standard eiffel revision of

released under an ise open-source license does not compile properly on smarteiffel. the gobo library documentation explains that despite heroic efforts eiffelbase was impossible to port to smarteiffel. the documentation recommends against using eiffelbase and mourns the number of free eiffel libraries that depend on it. a hello world program in eiffel major programming languages more

31	 emoticon is a synthetic word based on emotion and icon. an emoticon also called a smiley is a sequence of ascii characters used to represent a human face and express an emotion. emoticons that express happy or positive emotions are typically classified as smileys. emoticons are commonly used in email messages in bulletin boards or in internet chat the creator of the original emoticons is said to be scott fahlman. they have developed over the years as a replacement for facial expressions and emotions as a way to cope with the limitations of being forced to communicate in text only without misunderstandings due to the lack of information. books have been written on this subject with endless listings of a multitude of emoticons. to more easily recognise them put your head on either your left or right shoulder depending on whether the top of the emoticon is on the left or the right.

are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images which came to be called emoticons as well. emoticons for a smiley face and sad face appear in the first documented use in digital form. certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in a double byte language giving rise to especially complex forms sometimes known by their romanized japanese name of kaomoji. the use of emoticons can be traced back to the 19th century and they were commonly used in casual and humorous writing. digital forms of emoticons on the internet were included in a proposal by scott fahlman of carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh pennsylvania in a message on  september . see fahlman's website for a reconstruction of the entire thread the national telegraphic review and operators

followed by nose and the mouth. the two character version which omits the nose is also very popular. the most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form but each of them can be transformed by being rotated making them tiny ambigrams with or a without hyphen nose. there are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions like changing a character to express a new feeling or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. for example equals sad and equals very sad or weeping. a blush can be expressed as code: others include wink a grin smug and tongue out for disgust or simply just to stick the tongue out for silliness such as when blowing a raspberry. an often used combination is also code  for a heart and code for a broken heart. a representation of a cat face can be expressed like this: along with a mustache emoticon or a broad grin is often shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement and the addition of further d letters can suggest laughter or

traditional emoticon or similar-looking characters are commonly substituted for one another: for instance and can all be used interchangeably sometimes for subtly different effect or one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another. it is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other similar brackets such as instead of some variants are also more common in certain countries due to keyboard layouts. for example the smiley may occur in scandinavia where the keys for and are placed right beside each other. however the variant is without a doubt the dominant one in scandinavia making the version a rarity. marks are sometimes used. the letters and can be seen as an emoticon as the upright version of meaning that one is surprised and meaning that one is very happy respectively. some emoticons may be read right to left instead and in fact can only be written using standard ascii keyboard

use of japanese style english-language anime forums adopted those emoticons that could be used with the standard ascii characters available on western keyboards. because of this they are often called anime style emoticons in the english-speaking internet. they have since seen use in more mainstream venues including online gaming instant-messaging and other non-anime related forums. emoticons such as or which include the parentheses mouth or nose and arms especially those represented by the inequality signs  or  also are often referred to as not a in reference to their likeness to nintendo's

emoticons many of which cannot be reproduced in ascii. most kaomoji contain cyrillic and other foreign letters to create even more complicated expressions analogous to ascii art's level of complexity. to type such emoticons the input editor that is used to type japanese on a user's system is equipped with a dictionary of emoticons after which the user simply types the japanese word or something close to it that represents the desired emoticon to convert the input into such complicated emoticons. such expressions are known as shift jis art. users of channel in particular have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from obscure languages such as kannada: for a look of disapproval disbelief or confusion these were quickly picked up by chan and spread to other western sites soon after. some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right like mona ascii in south korea emoticons use korean hangul letters and the western style is rarely

31	rightly do we regard this service as the supreme act of christian worship and offer thanks to him who gave it. all the love and devotion which are so freely poured out during the service and the infinite abundance of spiritual power which is called down from on high in response are gathered together by the directing angel and shed abroad upon the world along with the benediction given by the celebrant. through the ceremony of the holy eucharist each time it is celebrated there passes forth into the world a wave of peace and strength the effect of which can hardly be overrated and this which is indeed the primary object of the service is achieved at every celebration whether the priest be alone in his private oratory or ministering to a vast congregation in some magnificent cathedral. therefore it offers to us an unequaled opportunity of becoming laborers together with god of doing him true and laudable service by acting as channels of his wondrous power.

31	debate exists as how to precisely define euthanasia. according to the narrow definition only acts of killing where a definite action is taken to end the patient's life constitutes euthanasia. in a more broad definition both direct killing and allowing a patient to die where the steps needed to preserve a life are simply not taken would constitute euthanasia. the moral importance of this distinction is that if one uses the narrow distinction allowing someone to die does not constitute euthanasia and one may argue that all acts of euthanasia are inherently wrong. 
31	 everway was marketed as a visionary roleplaying game first published by wizards of the coast under their alter ego brand in the mid lead designer was jonathan tweet.
 the game had a fantasy setting of the multiverse type with many different worlds some of which differed from generic fantasy. it appeared to have been heavily influenced by tarot featuring a fortune deck of cards illustrated by scott kirschner and jeff miracola the elements of history of ancient greece fire water earth and air and from around the world.
 everway was first with implementing in a commercial game several new concepts including much more source material and character creation than usual.
 the original edition contained the aforementioned fortune deck of thirty-six cards used for divination and action-resolution as well as ninety vision cards used as source material. the box also had three books of mostly source material and gameplaying tips.
 gaslight press is preparing a second edition. still no news on it.

31	 the ecmascript programming language commonly known as is an object-oriented scripting language specified by the european computer manufacturers standard.
 netscape communications originally developed the language under the name livescript but then renamed it to javascript and gave it a syntax closer to that of the java programming language developed by sun microsystems. this happened at roughly the same time netscape was including support for java technology in its netscape navigator browser.
 the current standard is ecma edition  as of december  it corresponds to javascript ..
 ecmascript is an object-oriented scripting language that connects through interfaces called document object models doms to applications
 especially to the server side web servers and the client side internet browsers of internet applications.
 many web sites use client-side ecmascript technology to create powerful dynamic web applications.
 it may use unicode and can evaluate regular expressions introduced in version . in netscape navigator  and internet explorer .
 ecmascript expressions contained in a string can be evaluated using the eval function.
 the language itself as described below is standardized and web browsers usually adhere to the standard.
 one major use of ecmascript is to write little functions that are embedded in html pages and interact with the dom of the browser to perform certain tasks not possible in static html alone such as opening a new window checking input values changing images as the mouse cursor moves over etc.
 unfortunately the doms of browsers are not standardized different browsers expose different objects or methods to the script and it is therefore often necessary to write different variants of an ecmascript function for the various browsers.
 the media type for ecmascript source code is .
 to put ecmascript code in an html page precede it with
 and follow it with
 the is mainly for older browsers without ecmascript support to avoid rendering the code as viewable text and can be omitted but this is invalid according to the html . standard.
 html elements may contain intrinsic events to which you can associate a script handler.
 to write valid html . insert the following declaration for the default scripting language in the header section of the document.
 premeta http-equivcontent-script-type
 variables are generally dynamically typed.
 variables are defined by either just assiging them a value or by using the statement.
 variables declared outside of any function are in global scope visible in the entire web page variables declared inside a function are local to that function.
 to pass variables from one page to another a developer can set a cookie or use a hidden frame or window in the background to store them.
 the primary data structure is an associative array similar to hashes in the perl programming language or dictionaries in python programming postscript programming and smalltalk programming
 elements may be accessed by numbers or associative names.
 thus the following expressions may all be equivalent:
 ecmascript has several kinds of built in objects namely object array string date and math.
 other objects belong to the document object window form links etc..
 by defining a constructor function it is possible to define objects.
 ecmascript is a prototype based object-oriented language.
 one can add additional properties or methods to individual objects after they have been created.
 to do this for all instances of a certain object type one can use the statement.
 for initial-expression condition increment-expression 
 this loop goes through all properties of an object or elements of an array.
 for variable in object 
 a function is a block with a possibly empty argument list that is normally given a name.
 a function may give back a return value.
 functionarg arg arg 
 example: euclid's original algorithm of finding the greatest common divisor. this is a geometrical solution which subtracts the longer segment from the shorter:
 function gcda b 
 while a ! b 
 if a  b 
 the number of arguments given when calling a function must not necessarily accord to the number of arguments in the function definition. within the function the arguments may as well be accessed through the array.
 most interaction with the user is done by using html forms which can be accessed through the html dom.
 however there are as well some very simple means of communicating with the user:
  alert dialog box
  confirm dialog box
  prompt dialog box
 newer versions of ecmascript as used in internet explorer  and netscape  include a tttry error handling statement.
 the codetry catch statement catches exceptions resulting from an error or a throw statement. its syntax is as follows:
 statements in which exceptions might be thrown
 statements that execute in the event of an exception
 statements that execute afterward either way
 initially the statements within the try block execute. if an exception is thrown the script's control flow immediately transfers to the statements in the catch block with the exception available as the error argument. otherwise the catch block is skipped. once the catch block finishes or the try block finishes with no exceptions thrown the statements in the finally block execute. this figure summarizes the operation of a try catch finally statement:
 here's a script that shows codetry catch in action step by step.
 the part may be omitted:
