4	 an electronic amplifier takes a low power signal and power and produces a high powered signal and heat. amplifiers always introduce some noise and distortion because no device is perfect.
 a wide variety of amplifiers have been developed.
 the earliest electronic amplifiers used vacuum tubes. the basic plan was to run an electric current from the anode through a vacuum through a grid to a cathode. by varying the electric charge on the grid the electrons would be repelled or permitted to pass through the grid. field effect transistors work almost exactly like tubes except they use a small piece of semiconductor rather than a hot filament and vacuum.
 another amplification scheme uses transistors. basically by varying the current to the base more current is permitted to flow through the transistor.
 electronic amplification has also been performed with diodes transformers hall effect devices and various types of gas-filled tubes. the basic principle is always to achieve a proportional increase in some combination of voltage and current in order to increase the power of a signal.
 one of the problems of amplifiers is to try to lower the resistance of the amplifying circuit element as much as possible. this increases efficiency so that the amplifier wastes less power and allows the transistor tube or other amplifying element to be more reliable by running cooler.
 one basic method of increasing efficiency is to try to either turn the current all the way on or all the way off. if the device is all the way on then its resistance is as low as possible. since it has minimal resistance the minimal amount of power is converted to heat in the device. this is usually called saturating the device. when the device is all the way off only the smallest amount of leakage current flows. therefore almost no current is converted to heat. again the device is efficient.
 this effect is exploited by class c d e and to a lesser extent b and ab amplifiers. only class a amplifiers to not use saturation. clearly the topic fascinates engineers.
 class a amplifiers deliberately operate the amplifying device in its linear range. they are designed for this purpose and just accept the inefficiency lessened reliability and waste heat. class a amplifiers can waste more than  of the available power as heat. however they introduce an absolute minimum of distortion.
 most hi-fi audio and instrumentation amplifiers are class a with careful design to remain linear. most often transistors with very wide linear ranges are used. the resistor networks that set the bias voltages to power these transistors are very precise always less than ! to keep the transistors in their linear regions. finally very accurate impedance matches are used to move the signal from one part of the amplifer to another. some people even favor tubes over transistors claiming that since tubes have more electrons moving than transistors the error is less because the tiny bump of noise caused by a single electron is less important in a tube than a transistor.
 the most exotic instrumentation amplifiers are helium-cooled ruby masers used in radio telescopes.
 linear amplifiers are also useful for single sideband and am transmitters. although they can be too expensive for commercial operators amateur and military users favor them.
 class b amplifiers chop off the top of the waves a process called clipping. this improves efficincy a lot but introduces distortion. class b amplifiers tend to create unwanted harmonics at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency an effect called harmonic distortion. the more the wave is clipped the closer it will approach to a square wave and the greater the harmonic distortion will become. a perfect square wave has all the odd harmonics up to infinity!
 a common way make a clipping amplifier is to bias the input signal so that the output of the amplifying device saturates the clipping bias can usually be adjusted by adjusting the value of a bias resistor. another way to make an amplifier clip is to have the linear range of the amplifying device pass the maximum voltage provided by the amplifer's power supply. this is sometimes used in very high power amplifiers where a bias resistor would waste a lot of power.
 there is a lot of historical hair-splitting about compromises on the percentage of clipping. a  clipping is popular because it seems to be a good compromise. some purists insist that a class b amplifer has to have  clipping and call a  clip an ab amplifier. a good portable am receiver will have an amplifier with about a  clip. this also seems to be a good compromise for small single-sideband and am transmitters.
 class c amplifiers approximate a wave by turning an amplifying element on or off. they're used for some radio transmitters notably frequency-modulated fm and data transmitters. they're also used for high-efficiency audio amplifiers like battery-powered bullhorns. they have terrible harmonic distortion. in transmitters class c amplifiers create unwanted out-of-band harmonics. for example when an amateur radio transmitter at low shortwave frequencies . to mhz creates television interference near  mhz. in audio pas class c amplifiers create very distorted audio so bad that it requires skilled listeners.
 class d digital amplifiers use several usually a binary number of high power switches i.e. transistors usually. the input signal must be sampled more than twice as often as the highest frequency of interest. the samples are turned into numbers. the numbers are used to switch combinations of the switches off and on and the current from these is fed through a summing electronic mixer usually a network of resistors. since any individual transistor is either on or off the amplifer is efficent.
 a badly-designed digital amplifier can be a multiplying electronic mixer. it can add difference-frequencies between the sample rate and the desired signals. these show up as unwanted low frequency noise. in order to avoid these an electronic filter must be placed on the input to throw away all signals with frequencies more than half that of the sampling frequency. a clever man named nyquist proved that one must have at least one sample for the high part of the wave and one for the low part of the wave. this sample rate two times the maximum interesting frequency is called the nyquist frequency.
 another problem with class d amplifiers is that the sets of switches can't perfectly match what the output should be. one can get closer with more switches and resistors. this error is called quantization error and appears as harmonic distortion. in practice most people can't hear quantization error in speech when the range of numbers is wider than about one in  and the sampling rate is greater than  times per second. this is the rate and width that long distance telephone lines use.
 class e amplifiers use a concept called duty cycle to amplify. the plan here is that the output signal is turned off and then on periodically. the time off and on is made to be proportional to the desired output power. since this amplifer just has one switch it can be cheaper than any other class.
 however it also has more types of error than any other class. class e amplifiers take samples and thus have a nyquist frequency and require a filtered input. it's also common to use digital circuits to control the duty cycle by counting some very fast periodic clock signal. when this is done class e amplifiers also have quantization error. last but not least class e amplifiers have sharp edges so they can have severe harmonic distortion though it occurs at frequencies above the frequencies of interest.
 class e amplifers are used to control motors. in fact it's hard to find any other type of motor controller for small dc motors. they have also been used as transmitters for commercial am and shortwave radio although more modern systems use class d amplifiers which introduce lower distortion.

4	 an earley parser is a type of chart parser used for parsing in computational linguistics named for their discoveror.
 earley parsers unlike other parsers execute in cubic time in the worst case unlike top-down or bottom-up parsers which can in the worst case take exponential time. however since the input in computational linguistics is generally small i.e. most sentences have no more than about a dozen words earley parsers often give worse performance than exponential time algorithms.
 unlike top-down or bottom-up parsers earley parsers can handle recursive phase structure rules such as:
 :a  a b
 without getting into an infinite loop. on the other hand there are still rules on which they will loop such as:
 parsing any grammar without getting into an infinite loop is provably an np complete problem.

4	 in catholicism and eastern orthodoxy an ecumenical council greek oikumene world-wide or general is a meeting of the whole church convened to discuss and settle matters of church doctrine. more local meetings are sometimes called synods but the distinction between a synod and a council is not hard and fast.
 church councils were from the beginning bureaucratic exercises. written documents were circulated speeches made and responded to votes taken and final documents published and distributed. a large part of what we know about the beliefs of comes from the documents quoted in councils in order to be refuted or indeed only from the deductions based on the refutations. for all councils canons greek kanon rule or ruling were published and survive. in some cases other documentation survives as well. study of the canons of church councils is the foundation of the development of canon law especially the reconciling of seemingly contradictory canons or the determination of priority between them. canons consist of doctrinal statements and disciplinary measures  most church councils and local synods dealt with immediate disciplinary concerns as well as major difficulties of doctrine. eastern orthodoxy typically views the purely doctrinal canons as dogmatic and applicable to the entire church at all times while the disciplinary canons are the application of those dogmas in a particular time and place these canons may or may not be applicable in other situations.
 both the catholic and eastern orthodox churches recognize seven councils in the early years of the church but catholics also recognize several councils called in later years by the pope whose authority the eastern orthodox do not accept. since the seventh ecumenical council the eastern orthodox have had what they call pan-orthodox councils with representatives of all eastern orthodox churches but they have not claimed that these councils were ecumenical. that would require including the roman catholic church. the roman catholic church does not recognize the pan-orthodox councils either.
 many especially those belonging to the magisterial traditions such as lutheranism and anglicanism accept the teachings of the first seven councils but do not ascribe to the councils themselves the same authority as catholics and the eastern orthodox do.
 the oriental orthodox only accept the teachings of some of the councils: the nestorians only accept the first council of nicaea and the first council of constantinople while the monophysites only accept nicaea i constantinople i and the council of ephesus. their differences in understanding of the nature and relationship of the son and the spirit to the trinity were worked out and defined at those councils and so they broke away from union with the larger body.
 the first seven councils were called by the emperor first the christian roman emperors and later the byzantine emperors. the relationship of the papacy to the validity of these councils is the ground of much controversy between roman catholicism and eastern orthodox churches and to historians.

4	 eiffel is a pure object-oriented programming language developed by bertrand meyer and his company interactive software engineering.
 eiffel closely follows dr. meyer's work in object oriented software construction second edition. eiffel differs from most popular languages in several ways.
 the goal of the language libraries and programing methods is to create reliable reusable software modules. it supports multiple inheritance genericity polymorphism and encapsulation. it's most important contribution to software engineering is design by contract where and class invariants are used to assist in documenting program correctness.
 eiffel also offers multiple class inheritance. many people such as the designers of java programming have objections to multiple inheritance. the eiffel implementation of multiple inheritance in the opinion of its supporters successfully meets these objections.
 eiffel's design is closely based on oop theory with less influence from other paradigms or support for legacy code. the language has formal support for abstract data types. in accordance with self documentation a software text should be able to reproduce its design documentation from the text itself. eiffel accomplishes this by using a formalized implementation of the abstract data type.
 eiffel studio an integrated development environment for eiffel offers an object-oriented interface for software engineering. however many programmers disliked it because it was far different than user interfaces to other integrated development environments.

4	 the concept of entropy is used for two related but not identical concepts in thermodynamics and information theory.
 the relationship between the two concepts reveals deep connections between information theory and thermodynamics.
 for the information theory usage see information entropy.
 in thermodynamics entropy s is a measure for the part of energy of a system which cannot be used to do work. in a wider sense it can also be interpreted as a measure for the disorder of a system.
 rudolf clausius introduced the quantity s for entropy in  saying i propose to call the magnitude s the
 entropy of the body from the greek word taurhoopieta transformation.
 entropy is defined as
 s  k ln omega
 where k is boltzman's constant and omega is the number of possible states that a system may be in.

4	over the time flowing water transport quartz paricles of sand which causes degradation of mechanical pieces such like for instance in water turbines on the stay vanes or on runner blades and on pelton buckets. because the thickness reduction of these elements are due to a natural phenomenon which is usually a slow process the word of erosion is often used instead of abrasion. when considering water turbines or other elements of machines where cavitation occures damages caused by cavitation should not be described as erosion. the phenomenology is totaly different. mixtures but takes then much more time to be visible. 
4	 esters are a functional group in organic chemistry and biochemistry consisting of an organic radical united with the residue of any oxygen acid organic or inorganic.
 the most common esters found in nature are fats which are esters of glycerine and fatty acids oleic etc.
 mainly resulting from the condensation of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. the process is called esterification:
 esters can participate in hydrogen bonds as hydrogen bond acceptors but cannot act as hydrogen bond donors unlike their parent alcohols. this ability to participate in hydrogen bonds leads them to be more water soluble than their parent hydrocarbons. but the limitations on their hydrogen bonding also make them more hydrophobic than either their parent alcohols or parent their lack of hydrogen-bond donating ability means that they can't form hydrogen bonds between ester which makes them generally more volatile than an acid or ester of similar molecular weight.
 many esters have distinctive odors which leads to their widespread use as artificial flavorings and fragrances. for example:
 :methyl butanoate smells of pineapple
 :methyl salicylate oil of wintergreen smells of the ointments called germolenetrade and ralgextrade in the uk
 :ethyl methanoate smells of raspberry
 :pentyl ethanoate smells of banana
 :pentyl pentanoate smells of apple
 :pentyl butanoate smells of pear or apricot
 :octyl ethanoate smells of orange
 esters also participate in ester hydrolysis  the breakdown of an ester by water.
 esters may also be decomposed by strong or as the result they are decomposed into an alcohol and a carboxylic acid or a salt of carboxylic acid

4	another criticism regardoing empirical evidence is low number of multi cultural proofs. many empirical studies come from a single culture. it is unknown if discoveries hold across all cultures. lack of genetic evidence there is no direct evidence of genetic basis of human behaviors like altruism maternal care mate selection etc.. there are no genes identified no mutants no inheritance patterns no gene polymorphism matching behavioral differences. this cannot be atributed to difficulty in studying as genetic base of many extremely rare diseases was found. if the supposed behaviors are polygenic this raises doubt on how they could be effectively subject to directional selection. genetic basis is the cornerstone to propose evolutionary origin of human behavior.
