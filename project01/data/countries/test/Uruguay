85	another way of solving the same system of linear equations is by substitution. :mathx  y   :mathx  y  . an equivalent for y can be deduced by using one of the two equations. using the second equation: :mathx  y   substracting x from each side of the equation: :math y    x and multiplying by : :math y  x  . using this y value in the first equation in the original system: :mathx  x     :mathx  x     :mathx     adding  on each side of the equation: :mathx   :mathx   using this value in one of the equations the same solution as in the previous method is obtained. :mathbegincases x   y  . note that this is not the only way to solve this specific system in this case as well y could have been solved before x.
