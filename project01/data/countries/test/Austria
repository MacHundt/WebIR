9	something rarely addressed is the role of the speaker system as an electrical generator pushing back spurious signals into the amplifier. the speaker is a generator as well as a motor and these generated electical signals go back into the amplifier and via the negative feedback loop get to the darlington or similar comparator at the first or early stage of the power amplifier. the comparison is supposed to reduce or eliminate spurious distortions but it cannot contibute to reducing the spurious distortions generated by the speaker as the speaker system is outside the loop. this is the best case for low on no negative feedback in a power amplifier

9	not only communication processes are in most cases sign-mediated interactions which are governed by three levels of semiotic rules syntactic pragmatic and semantic. therefore communication is a kind of social interaction where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of semiotic rules. 
9	plant communication is observed a within the plant organism i.e. within plant cells and between plant cells b between plants of the same or related species and c between plants and non-plant organisms especially in the rootzone. plant roots communicate in parallel with rhizobia bacteria with fungi and with insects in the soil. this parallel sign-mediated interactions which are governed by syntactic pragmatic and semantic rules are possible because of the decentralized nervous system of plants. as recent research shows  of intraorganismic plant communication processes are neuronal-like. plants communicate also via volatiles in the case of herbivory attack behavior to warn neighboring plants. in parallel they produce other volatiles which attract parasites which attack these herbivores. in stress situations plants can overwrite the genetic code they inherited from their parents and revert to that of their grand or great-grandparents  see also: witzany g.  plant communication from biosemiotic perspective. plant signaling amp behavior :-. 
9	there are communication processes between different species of bacteria and between bacteria and non bacterial life such as eukaryotic hosts. beneath the semiochemicals necessary for developmental processes of bacterial communities such as division sporulation and synthesis of secondary metabolites there are physical contact-mediated behavioral patterns being important in biofilm organisation. there are three classes of signalling molecules for different purposes i.e. signalling within the organism to coordinate gene expressions to generate adequate response behavior signalling between same or related and different species. the most popular communicative behavior is quorum sensing. quorum sensing is the term of description for sign-mediated interactions in which chemical molecules are produced and secreted by bacteria. they are recognized of the bacterial community dependent on a critical concentration and in a special ratio to the population density. these molecules trigger the expression of a great variety of gene transcriptions. the semiochemicals used by bacteria are of great variety especially because some signalling molecules are multiply re-usable components. today three kinds of communicative goals are distinguished: a reciprocal communication active sign-mediated interactions which is beneficial for both interacting parts b messages which are produced as response on a triggering event which may be an indicator for a receiver which was not specially targeted by the producer. a coincidental event which is neutral  except of the energy costs of production  to the producer but beneficial for the receiver c signalling to manipulate the receiver i.e. to cause a response behavior which is onesided beneficial to the producer and harms the receivers often in that they behave against their normal goals. the three classes of bacteria communication enable bacteria to generate and coordinate different behavioral patterns: self and non-self identification i.e. identification of other colonies and measurement of their size pheromone based courtship for mating alteration of colony structure in formatting of fruiting bodies initiation of developmental and growth processes e.g. sporulation. 
9	fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their own growth and development such as the formation of mycelia and fruiting bodies. additionally fungi communicate with same and related species as well as with nonfungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions especially with bacteria unicellular eukaryotes plants and insects. the used semiochemicals are of biotic origin and they trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner in difference while to even the same chemical molecules are not being a part of biotic messages doesnt trigger to react the fungal organism. it means fungal organisms are competent to identify the difference of the same molecules being part of biotic messages or lack of these features. so far five different primary signalling molecules are known that serve to coordinate very different behavioral patterns such as filamentation mating growth pathogenicity. behavioral coordination and the production of such substances can only be achieved through interpretation processes: self or non-self abiotic indicator biotic message from similar related or non-related species or even noise i.e. similar molecules without biotic content. 
9	people. pragmatics defines communication as any sign-mediated interaction that follows combinatorial context-specific and content-coherent rules. communicative competence designates the capability to install intersubjective interactions which means that communication is an inherent social interaction.

9	motiviation for the existence from a formal point of view the existence of the euler-maclaurin summation formula can be motivated as follows. the difference operator may formally be written as mathdelta  ed  where denotes an ordinary differential operator. since the summation operator is the inverse operator to the difference operator now we know that the exponential generating function of the bernoulli numbers :math fracxex  sumninfin bn fracxnn! :mathsigma  fracd sumninfin bn fracdnn!  fracd frac i  frac d  dots  int  frac i  frac d  dots where denotes the integral operator. this pure formal derivation indicates the existence of the formula. the idea is due to legendre.

9	 extra-vehicular activity eva is work done by an astronaut away from the earth outside of the spacecraft: in space flight or while on the moon see list of lunar astronauts or possibly in the future on another planet or moon. in the early days of space flight it was called space walk. the first eva was carried out by soviet cosmonaut aleksei leonov on march   from the voskhod  spacecraft. the first woman to perform an eva was cosmonaut svetlana savitskayaon on july   while she was aboard the salyut  space station.
 an eva is dangerous business for a number of different reasons. the primary one is collision with debris. orbital velocity at km above the earth typical for a space shuttle mission is this is  times the speed of a bullet so the kinetic energy of a particle as small as a fleck of paint or a grain of sand is equal to that of a bullet with a mass that is  times as large! every space mission creates more orbiting debris so this problem will continue to become worse.
 scientists are developing tele-operated robots for outside construction work to eliminate the need for evas.

9	 the epistles to the thessalonians are two books of the new testament of the bible.
 the first epistle to the thessalonians was the first of all paul of epistles. it was in all probability written about the end of a.d. .
 the occasion of its being written was the return of timotheus from macedonia bearing tidings from thessalonica regarding the state of the church there acts :  thess. :. while on the whole the report of timothy was encouraging it also showed that diverse errors and misunderstandings regarding the tenor of paul's teaching had crept in amongst them. he addresses them in this letter with the view of correcting these errors and especially for the purpose of exhorting them to purity of life reminding them that their sanctification was the great end desired by god regarding them.
 the second epistle to the thessalonians was probably written from corinth greece and not many months after the first.
 the occasion of the writing of this epistle was the arrival of tidings that the tenor of the first epistle had been misunderstood especially with reference to the second advent of christ. the thessalonians had embraced the idea that paul had taught that the day of christ was at hand that christ's coming was just about to happen. this error is corrected : and the apostle prophetically announces what first must take place before the end times. the great was first to arise.
