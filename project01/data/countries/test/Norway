11	radio frequency is the use a tuned load supply: one frequency well but the bandwidth is limited by the q-factor of the tuned circuit which is not a serious limitation. by further in practical class-c amplifiers a tuned load is invariably usedelectronic and radio engineering r.p.terman mcgraw hill . in one common arrangement the resistor shown in the circuit above is replaced with a parallel-tuned circuit consisting of an inductor and capacitor in parallel whose components are chosen to resonate the frequency of the input signal. power can be coupled to a load by transformer action with a secondary coil wound on the inductor. the average voltage at the drain is then equal to the supply voltage and the signal voltage appearing across the tuned circuit varies from near zero to near twice the supply voltage during the rf cycle. the input circuit is biassed so that the active element e.g. transistor conducts for only a fraction of the rf cycle usually one third  degrees or less. the active element conducts only while the drain voltage is passing through its minimum. by this means power dissipation in the active device is minimised and efficiency increased. ideally the active element would pass only an instantaneous current pulse while the voltage across it is zero: it then disspates no power and  efficiency is achieved. however practical devices have a limit to the peak current they can pass and the pulse must therefore be widened to around  degrees to obtain a reasonable amount of power and the efficiency is then .

11	earned value as experience by the vast majority of systems engineers is a complete waste of time and a trick used by accountants to micromanage engineering works. earn value is often perceived as a micro managing technique that adds nothing to the system engineering process other then a useless thick layer of statusersalso known as program managers and accountants. the same engineers still performs the same work but now have to refocus their mind from engineering task to reporting on a minute by minute basis of what is being worked on and how much money is spent. few engineers who stayed true to the profession and have not sold out with a mba degree enjoys earned value as they often see it as an obstruction to their job. earned value is often seen as a method of taking the control of a complex engineering project involving extremely complex math completely out of the hands of capable engineers and allowing accountants who practice the simplistic elementary math such as the pseudo equations above to make top level decisions. the vast majority of engineers who are forced to endure earned value perceive it as a system that only adds overhead costs.

11	a joint committee consisting of the eea-efta states plus the european commission representing the eu has the function of extending relevant eu law to the non eu members. an eea council meets twice yearly to govern the overall relationship between the eea members. rather than setting up pan-eea institutions the activities of the eea are regulated by the efta surveillance authority and the efta court. grants the eea and norway grants are the financial contributions of iceland liechtenstein and norway to reduce social and economic disparities in europe. in the period from  to  .nbspbillion of project funding is made available for project funding in the  beneficiary states in central and southern europe. the eea and norway grants were established in conjunction with the  enlargement of the european economic area eea which brings together the eu iceland liechtenstein and norway in the internal market. the eea and norway see of iceland to the european union union union relations except for switzerland the efta members are also members of the european economic area eea. the eea comprises three member states of the european free trade association efta and  member states of the european states of the european union eu excluding croatia which is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all eea agreement.aspx eea agreement  efta. efta.int -. retrieved on -. namecroatsigncite joins the free trade association it was established on  january  following an agreement with the european community which became the eu. main text of the kb it allows the efta-eea states to participate in the internal internal market without being member state of the european of the eu. they adopt almost all eu legislation related to the single market except laws on agriculture and fisheries. however they also contribute to and influence the formation of new eea relevant policies and legislation at an early stage as part of a formal decision-shaping process. in addition independence and direct membership of international bodies in their own right means the countries are able to participate in and become signatories to various conventions such as the basel convention of  that are only adopted by the eu many years later . one efta member switzerland has not joined the eea but has switzerlandeuropean union series of bilateral agreements including a free trade agreement with the eu. the following table summarises the various components of eu laws applied in the efta countries and their sovereign territories. some territories of eu member states also have a special member state territories and the european status in regard to eu laws applied as is the case with some microstates and the european microstates. !colspan span stylewhite-space:nowrapefta member statesbr sovereign ! applicationbr european union law ! enforceable in local courts? ! member state of the european ! schengen area? ! european union value added tax vat area? ! european union customs customs territory? ! eu internal market? nameeeaeuropean economic area norway and iceland schengen association agreement article  namesvalbardbecause of the politics of treaty it is even outside of the norway taxation area. agreement on the european economic area  protocol  on svalbard and angenaidpartyidndoclangen declaration for activation of protocol exclusion. and the european multiple sectoral agreements  relationship to the european economic area  
11	the efta council is the highest governing body of efta. the council usually meets eight times a year at the ambassadorial level heads of permanent delegations to efta and twice a year at ministerial level. in the council meetings the delegations consult with one another negotiate and decide on policy issues regarding efta. each member state is represented and has one vote though decisions are usually reached through consensus. the council discusses substantive matters especially relating to the development of efta relations with third countries and the management of free trade agreements and keeps under general review relations with the eu third country policy and administration. it has a broad mandate to consider possible policies to promote the overall objectives of the association and to facilitate the development of links with other states unions of states or international organisations. the council also manages relations between the efta states under the efta convention. questions relating to the eea are dealt with by the standing committee in brussels. the day-to-day running of the secretariat is headed by the secretary-general kristinn f. rnason who is assisted by two deputy secretaries-general one based in geneva and the other in brussels. the three posts are shared between the member state. the division of the secretariat reflects the division of eftas activities. the secretariat employs approximately  staff members of whom a third are based in geneva and two thirds in brussels and luxembourg. the headquarters in geneva deals with the management and negotiation of free trade agreements with non-eu countries and provide support to the efta council. in brussels the secretariat provides support for the management of the eea agreement and assists the member states in the preparation of new legislation for integration into the eea agreement. the secretariat also assists the member states in the elaboration of input to eu decision making. the two duty stations work together closely to implement the vaduz conventions stipulations on the intra-efta free trade area. the efta statistical office in luxembourg contributes to the development of a broad and integrated european statistical system. the efta statistical office in luxembourg contributes to the development of a broad and integrated european statistical system. the efta statistical office eso is located in the premises of eurostat the statistical office of the european union in luxembourg and functions as a liaison office between eurostat and the efta national statistical institutes. eso's main objective is to promote the full inclusion of the efta states in the european statistical system thus providing harmonised and comparable statistics to support the general cooperation process between efta and the eu within and outside the eea agreement. the cooperation also entails technical cooperation programmes with third countries and training of european statisticians. 
11	evil broad term used to indicate a negative moral ethical judgment often used to describe intentional acts that are cruel unjust or selfish. evil is usually contrasted with good which describes intentional acts that are kind just or unselfish. in many cultures evil is used to describe acts or thoughts which are contrary to some particular religion. in some religions evil is active force often personified as an such as satan or ahriman. in western philosophy evil is usually limited to doing harm or damage to an object or creature. plato argued that which we call evil is merely ignorance and that good is that which everyone desires. benedict de spinoza said that the difference between good and evil is merely one of personal inclinations: so everyone the highest right nature judges what is good and what is evil considers his own advantage according to his own temperament .benedict de spinoza ethics translated by edwin curley penguin classics  isbn  isbn-:  p.  the duality of goodness and value versus evil is expressed in some form another  those who believe in the duality theory evil believe that evil cannot exist without good nor good without evil as they are both objective states opposite ends of the same scale. the legal term malice legal from the latin malus meaning bad describes the deliberate human intent to harm while sadism refers to a psychological state in which a person derives pleasure from the pain of another person. in the philosophical concept of evil the intent to cause harm is crucial so that acts that would otherwise considered evil are called evil when very young children by animals or by the insane see amorality. there is also class of deliberate acts known to be harmful to another which are not considered evil because: they are acts of self-defense or defense of another they are considered justified see just war in judaism and christianity evil is the result of forsaking god. deuteronomy : judaism stresses obedience to the god's laws as written in the torah see also tanakh and the laws and rituals laid down in the mishnah and the talmud. in christianity some sects stress obedience to god's law. other sects emphasize christ's statement that love of god and love of your fellow man is the whole of the law. still others emphasize the idea that humanity is within itself irremediably evil and in need of forgiveness. see original sin in the hebrew scriptures evil is related to the concept of sin mdash sinned translated in hebrew as chata which means missed the mark a term from archery. the mark in question is the law of god. in some abrahamic faiths evil is personified as satan a challenger of the law or will of god. satan is defined in hebrew aramaic and greek writings collectively as the devil the adversary false accuser slanderer the counterfeit a liar a murderer one with no truth the serpent the evil one the tempter and a prowling lion seeking someone to devour. these faiths also teach that spiritual or demons may humans or animals and tempt them to do evil. it is argued by those who follow the documentary hypothesis and higher biblical criticism that this concept of satan developed over time. hebrew satan seems originally to have been the accuser a title given to the prosecuting attorney at the heavenly court. he still has this character in the book of job. it is argued that the larger role of satan and his identification with lucifer later associated with the snake in the garden of eden occurred during the period of the babylonian captivity and subsequent exposure to beliefs.sanders e.p. the historical figure of jesus allen lane the penguin press p.   orthodox jews still hold to the traditional view of satan being an accusing angel in the heavenly court. some forms of christianity as well as judaism do not personify evil in satan these christian sects instead consider the human heart to be inherently bent toward deceit although human beings are responsible for their choices whereas in judaism there is no prejudice in one's becoming good or evil at time of birth. in judaism satan is viewed as one who tests us for god rather than one who works against god and evil as in the christian denominations above is a matter of choice.the greek word used in the new testament for evil can just as well be rendered by a wrongdoer or even as the evil one. this ambiguity means that a passage in the sermon on the mount has been translated do not resist evil and do not set yourself against a wrong-doer. one forming light and creating darknessbr well being and creating calamitybr am the lord who does all some cultures or philosophies believe that evil can arise without meaning or reason in neo-platonic philosophy this is called absurd evil. christianity in general does not adhere to this belief but the prophet isaiah implied that god is ultimately responsible for everything including evil:!--removed text deal with it if you want :  isa.: i form the light and create darkness: i make peace and create evil: i the lord do all these things. note: most new translations do not include the word evil. the word used is rah and it is more linked to troubles or unpleasantness. - in the bible the story of job biblical is a bold example of how evil exists and seems at times to be victorious although according to christian beliefs all have sinned and fallen short of the perfection of god epistle to the : and the price of missing the mark of perfection sin is death. the crucifixion of jesus was the sacrifice of a sinless superior and good being for the sins of mankind thus salvation from death occurs in understanding this idea and making the christ lord over one's life. christian science believes that evil arises from the fallible nature of good intentioned humans and the misunderstanding of the goodness of nature. in the same way that misunderstanding mathematical concepts results in incorrect answers misunderstanding god's reality leads to incorrect choices and thus evil. this has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil or even god being the source of evil instead evil is the work of fallible humans incorrectly acting in god's perfect reality. an important concept relating to the belief that all have sinned and sin separates man from god is that these beliefs imply a certain equality of all humanity no one is no more evil than any other person. the murderous are in the same category as the saintly and the rich are no more worthy of attention than the poor epistle of . the only difference between people in terms of christian salvation is that some have made the commitment to christ and that others have not. for the french philosopher michel henry god is the invisible phenomenological that never stops to generate us and to give us to ourselves in its pathetic self-revelation. god is love because love itself in an infinite love is life. by consequence life is good in itself. the evil corresponds to all what denies or attacks life it finds its origin in death which is the negation of life. this death is an inner and spiritual death which is the separation with god and which consists simply in not loving in living selfishly as if god didn't exist was not father of us all and we his beloved sons as if we were not all brothers generated by a same life. the evil peaks in the violence of hatred that is at the origin of all the crimes of all the wars and of all the genocides. but the evil is also the common origin of all those blind processes and of all those false abstractions that lead so many people to misery and exclusion. in the originally religion of zoroastrianism the world is a battle ground between the god ahura mazda also called ormazd and the evil spirit angra mainyu also called ahriman. the final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a day of judgement in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire and those who are evil will be cast down forever. in iranian belief angels and saints are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness. in liberal democratic societies many associate evil in politics with authoritarian and totalitarian regimes and with leaders who are demagogues. leaders commonly given as examples of political evil include adolf hitler in germany for the mass genocide of jews in the holocaust joseph stalin in the soviet union for his purges and his persecution of the kulaks and mao tse tung in china for the devastation brought on by the cultural revolution. the political writings of niccol machiavelli in the prince explore the relationship between politics and the moral norms of good and evil. notoriously machiavelli makes the case that morality can sometimes be a hindrance in the pursuit of power because in the political realm ends justifies the means. machiavelli argues that a ruler may have to act immorally to protect both his personal power and the interests of the state. the following quotations from the prince provide examples of machiavelli's views. : the ends justifies the means the world consists mainly of vulgar people and the few who are honorable can safely be ignored when so many vulgar rally around the prince.  :benefits must be conferred gradually so they are appreciated more thoroughly and harm should be inflicted all at once. both harm and benefits should not serve as quick solutions to  :force is the most effective and efficient means to do something and the virtuous prince will employ its  in common parlance the term machiavellian is used to describe politicians or political policy that is amoral. machiavelli did not make a case for evil but rather argued pragmatically that a prince could not practically follow the moral codes of the common people. he is explicit in stating that politicians who choose or are forced to commit evil acts must be prepared to face the moral consequences of their actions. w. s. and sir arthur satirize this view in the pirates of penzance where the pirate king sings :for many a king on a first class throne :if he wants to call his crown his own :must manage somehow to get through :more dirty deeds than ever i do. in contrast to the views expressed above theocratic states often consider western democracies to be evil because they allow women to dress provocatively allow the drinking of alcohol and allow materialist individualism to to supplant the enforcement of holy writ. a fundamental question is whether there is a universal transcendent definition of evil or whether evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. c. s. lewis in the abolition of man maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil rape and murder. on the other hand it is hard to find any act that was not acceptable some society. less than  years ago america other countries practiced brutal forms slavery. the during world ii found genocide acceptable did the imperial japanese army with nanking massacre and the hutu interhamwe in the rwandan genocide. name  gourevitch  cite book last  gourevitch first  phillip title  we wish to inform you that tomorrow we killed with our families publisher  picador id  isbn -- name  pbs cite web title  frontline: the triumph of evil. url  accessdate   today there is strong disagreement as to whether homosexuality and abortion are perfectly acceptable or evils. universalists consider evil independent of culture and wholly related to acts or intents. thus while the ideological leaders nazism and the hutu interhamwe accepted and considered it good to commit genocide the universally evil act of genocide renders the entire ideology or culture evil. views on the nature of evil tend to fall into one of two opposed camps. one moral absolutism holds that good and evil are fixed concepts established by god nature morality common sense or some other source. the other moral relativism holds that standards of good and evil are only products of local culture custom or prejudice. moral universalism is the attempt to find a compromise between the absolutist sense of morality and the relativist view universalism claims that morality is only flexible to a degree and that what is truly good or evil can be determined by examining what is commonly considered to be evil amongst all humans. a looser definition of evil describes it as death and suffering whether it results from human or from other natural causes e.g. earthquakes and famine. in other words it is not merely the intention to do evil but the end result namely harm to others that is evil. this is sometimes referred to as natural evil and some philosophers hold the position that this is an inappropriate use of the word evil as it is without intent. as plato observed there are relatively few ways to do good but there are countless ways to do evil can therefore have a much greater impact on our lives and the lives of other beings capable of suffering. for this reason some philosophers e.g. bernard gert maintain that preventing evil is more important than promoting good in formulating moral rules and in conduct. some people define being evil as not only inflicting pain and suffering but also as performing an act for either solely selfish materialistic reasons i.e. power or wealth or because they are sadistic and derive pleasure from the act. under this definition of evil a person who commits morally wrong acts for sincerely benevolent reasons would not be evil even if most people disagreed with the means thus justified. disregarding whether the ends were to be considered morally wrong they would not be classified as evil so long as they truly believed in the pursued higher goal. this mean the actions viewed as morally wrong just that an evil intent them as the intent of the actions a key factor. absolute ignorance of the concept of morality would render a person completely morally neutral. regardless of the source of their definitions most human cultures have a set of beliefs about what things actions and ideas are undesirable. undesirable circumstances are often categorised as evil within cultures. natural evils generally include accidental death disease and other misfortunes although some cultures see these occurrences instead a healthy part of the natural order.  moral evils generally include violence deceit or other destructive and antisocial behavior toward others although the same behavior toward outsiders of the group good. war provides many examples and god is always on the winning side. most cultures recognize many levels of immoral behaviour from minor vices to major crimes. these beliefs are often encoded into the laws of a society with methods of judgement and punishment for offenses. is evil a useful term? there is a school of thought that holds that no person is evil that only acts properly considered evil. psychologist and mediator marshall rosenberg claims that the root of violence is the very concept of evil or badness. when we label someone as bad or evil rosenberg claims it invokes the desire to punish or inflict pain. it also makes it easy for us to turn off our feelings towards the person we are harming. he cites the use of language in nazi germany as being a key to how the german people were able to do things to other human beings that they normally wouldn't do. he links the concept of evil to our judicial system which seeks to create justice via punishment mdash punitive justice mdash punishing acts that are seen as bad or wrong. he contrasts this approach with what he found in cultures the idea of evil was non-existent. such cultures when someone harms another person they are believed to be out of harmony with themselves and their community they are seen as sick or ill and measures are taken to restore them to a sense of harmonious relations with themselves and as opposed to punishing them. psychologist albert ellis makes a similar claim in his school of psychology called rational emotive behavioral therapy or rebt. he says the root of anger and the desire to harm someone is almost always one of these beliefs:  that have done certain things  that someone is an person for doing what they did  that they deserve to be punished for what they did he claims that without one of the preceding thoughts violence is next to impossible. prominent american psychologist m. scott peck on the other hand describes evil as militant  in this it is close to the original judeo-christian concept of sin as a consistent process that leads to failure to reach one's true goals. according to scott peck an evil person:  projects his or her evils and sins onto others and tries to remove them from others  maintains a high level of respectability and lies incessantly in order to do so  is consistent in his or her sins. evil persons are characterized not so much by the magnitude of their sins but by their consistency  is unable to think from other people's viewpoints. he also considers certain institutions evil as his discussion the my lai massacre its attempted coverup illustrate. this definition acts and state terrorism would also considered evil. anton szandor lavey former head of the church satan asserts that evil is actually good often-used slogan is evil is live spelled backwards. this belief is usually a reaction to evil being described as destructive where apologists claim that definition in opposition to the natural pleasures and instincts of men and women. in more extreme cases belief can be interpreted to mean that hurting others is acceptable if you can get away with it an interpretation that anton lavey never supported. even martin luther allowed that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good. he wrote seek out the society of your boon companions drink play talk bawdy and amuse yourself. one must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for the devil so as to give him the chance to make one scrupulous over mere nothings . martin luther werke xx p it is not uncommon to find people in power who are indifferent to good or evil taking actions based solely on practicality this approach to politics was put forth by niccol machiavelli a sixteenth century florentine writer who advised politicians  it is far safer to be feared than loved.niccolo machiavelli the prince dante university of america press  isbn  isbn-:  sociological views on evil some and have attempted to construct scientific explanations for the development of specific characteristics of an antisocial personality type called the sociopath. the sociopath is typified by extreme self-serving behavior and a lack of conscience as well as an inability to with others and to restrain himself from or to feel remorse for harm personally caused to others. however a diagnosis of antisocial or sociopathic personality disorder formerly called psychopathic mental disorder is sometimes criticized as being at the present time no more scientific than calling a person evil. there is much debate over this however. some most prominently robert hare hare author of without conscience consider psychopathy to be a widespread disorder quite distinct from antisocial personality disorder. what critics perceive to be a determination is disguised they argue with a scientific-sounding name but no complete description of a mechanism by which the abnormality can be identified. words critics argue sociopaths are such first thought be evil  a determination which itself is not derived by a scientific method. research into sociopathology has also been investigated technology review: what can neuroscience tell us about evil? are there biological reasons why evil rather moral? are there physical underpinnings behaviors that societies reject as sociopathic? most neurological research into sociopathology has focused regions the neocortex involved impulse control. research seems indicate that sociopathy at least partially be related a lack ability to realize the true consequences of one's actions. when person acts in such a way as to use others as means to achieve one's ends or fails to consider the consequences of his or her acts upon the lives of others it is considered to be psychopathic or sociopathic. if one accepts the christian ethic that by their deeds you shall know them such acts evil. the view taken by walter wink the christian theologian of non-violence. some authors like the psychologist benjamin b. wolman consider society as a whole to be moving towards a psychopathic mindset but this stance has yet to gain wider acceptance. in business evil refers to unfair or unethical business practices. firms that have a monopoly are able to maintain the monopoly using tactics that are deemed unfair monopolies have power to set prices at levels which are not socially efficient. some therefore consider monopolies evil. economists generally consider monopolies to be evil though they recognize that certain business practices by monopolies are often not in the public interest. recently the term evil has been applied much more broadly especially in the technology and intellectual property industries. one of the slogans of google is dont be evil in response to much-criticized technology companies as microsoft and aol and the tagline of independent music recording company magnatune is we are not evil referring to the alleged evils the riaa. the economist david korten has argued that corporations set up as fictive individuals by law are required to work according only to the criteria of making profits for shareholders meaning they function as sociopathic organisations that inherently do evil in damaging denying labour justice and the powerless. ayn rand on evil in her novels most explicitly in atlas shrugged and nonfiction especially in her work on morality the virtue of selfishness ayn rand argues that evil is that which destroys or inhibits man's life and pursuit of happiness and the good is that which furthers man's life. in ayn rand's words: blockquotethe standard of value of the objectivist ethicsthe standard by which one judges what is good or evilis man's life or: that which is required for man's survival qua man. since reason is man's basic means of survival that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good that which negates opposes or destroys it is the evil. the virtue of selfishness rand saw that evil is a negative with no power of its own. she saw the essence of evil as a leech that only lives because the good let themselves be slaves to it. evil value is an absence and negation evil is impotent and power but that which we let it extort from us.for the new intellectual she saw that if the good doesn't sanction evil people and ideas they will eventually self-destruct. according rand that is the nature of evil: in any compromise between food and poison it is only death that can win. in any compromise between good and evil it is only evil that can profit.for the new intellectual in her view the proper moral purpose of life is the pursuit of one's own happiness.  beyond good and evil  good and  good and evil  political usages of the term evil  problem of evil  roy roy f.  evil: inside

11	argued that human existence is the will to power a desire to create and destroy as we please in an artistic sense. great individuals invent their own values and create the very terms under which they excel. kierkegaard's knight of faith and nietzsche's bermensch are examples of those who define the nature of their own existence. in contrast pascal did not reason that human nature and identity are constituted by the free decisions and choices of people. kierkegaard and nietzsche died too soon to be a part of the 20th century existentialist movement. they were unique philosophers and their works and influence are not limited to existentialism. they have been appropriated and seen as precursors to many other intellectual movements including postmodernism and various strands of psychology. thus it is unknown whether they would have supported the existentialism of the 20th century or accepted tenets of jean-paul sartre's version of it. nevertheless their works are precursors to many later developments in existentialist thought. in germany one of the first german existentialists was karl jaspers. jaspers recognized the importance of kierkegaard and nietzsche and attempted to build an existenz philosophy around the two. heidegger who was influenced by jaspers and the phenomenologist edmund husserl wrote his most influential work being and time which postulates dasein literally being there a being that is constituted by its temporality illuminates and interprets the meaning of being in time. dasein is sometimes considered the human subject but heidegger denies the cartesian dualism of although existentialists view heidegger to be an important philosopher in the movement he vehemently denied being an existentialist in the sartrean sense and responded to sartre in a letter about humanism denying his philosophy was existentialism. jean-paul sartre is perhaps the most well-known existentialist and is one of the few to have accepted being called an existentialist. sartre developed his version of existentialist philosophy under the influence of husserl and heidegger. being and nothingness is perhaps his most important work about existentialism. sartre was also talented in his ability to espouse his ideas in different mediums including philosophical essays novels plays and the theatre. no exit and nausea are two of his celebrated works. in the 1960s, he attempted to reconcile existentialism and marxism in his work the critique of dialectical reason. albert camus was a friend of sartre until their falling-out and wrote several works with existential themes including the rebel the stranger stranger and the myth of sisyphus. he like many others rejected the existentialist label and considered his works to be in the myth of sisyphus camus uses the analogy of the greek myth to demonstrate the futility of existence. in the myth sisyphus is condemned to roll a rock up a hill for eternity but when he reaches the summit the rock will roll back to the bottom again. camus believes that this existence is pointless but he feels sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task simply by continually applying himself to it. simone de beauvoir who was a long time companion to sartre wrote about feminist and existential ethics in her works including the second sex and ethics of ambiguity. maurice merleau-ponty an often overlooked existentialist was a companion of sartre's. his understanding of phenomenology was far greater than that of his fellow existentialists. his work humanism and terror greatly influenced sartre. michel foucault would also be considered an existentialist through his use of history to reveal the constant alterations of created meaning thus proving its failure to produce a cohesive form of reality.  dostoevsky kafka and the literary existentialists  many writers who are not usually considered philosophers have also had a major influence on existentialism. franz kafka created characters who struggle with hopelessness and absurdity. fyodor dostoevsky a russian literary writer wrote such novels as crime and punishment and the brothers karamazov. notes from underground details the story of a man who is unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself. many of dostyevsky's novels such as crime and punishment have covered issues pertinent to existential philosophy while simultaneously refuting the validity of the claims of existentialism notably the superman theory advocated by nietzsche. throughout crime and punishment we see the protagonist raskolnikov and his character develop away from existential ideas and beliefs in favour of more traditionally christian ones. in the 1950s and 1960s, existentialism experienced a resurgence in popular artforms. in fiction jack kerouac and the beat poets adopted existentialist themes. hermann hesse's steppenwolf based on an idea in kierkegaard's  sold well in the west. in addition arthouse films began quoting and alluding to existentialist thought and thinkers. existentialist novelists were generally seen as a mid-s phenomenon that continued until the mid to late 1970s. most of the major writers were either french or from french african colonies. small circles of other europeans were seen as literary existential precursors by the existentialists themselves however literary history increasingly has questioned the accuracy of this idealism for earlier models. there is overlap between the expatriate american beat generation writers who found paris their spiritual home and writers of novels. this also extends to the delayed action of the french permanent enamorment with u.s. hard boiled which as franois and others in the cahiers du cinma indicated influenced novels and plays. to some extent as well the surrealist movement of andre breton and others which questioned the established reality made possible the isolation of non-academic novels protagonised by amoral anti-heroes. this curriculum is known to be taught by aspiring monk jack keithley. although thought became the focus of many intellectuals in the 1970s and thereafter much postmodern writing considers themes similar to existentialism. one should not however confuse postmodernism with existentialism. existential cinema deals more with the themes of: retaining authenticity in an apathetic mechanical world  something postmodernism would staunchly reject as authenticity is related to a non existent reality. the consciousness of death e.g. heidegger's being towards death exemplified in ingmar bergman's film the seventh seal . the feelings of alienation and loneliness consequent to being unique in a world of indifferent others or in kierkegaard phrase the crowd or nietzsche's the herd the concept alltgliche selbstsein everyday-ness or ennui which heidegger explicated in his book sein und zeit  english translation being and time. since  much cultural activity in art cinema and literature contains postmodern and existential elements which ironically would support the postmodern thesis of borderlessness between concepts. books such as do androids dream of electric sheep now republished as blade runner by philip k. dick fight club by chuck palahniuk and toilet: the novel by michael szymczyk all distort the line between reality and appearance while simultaneously espousing strong existential themes. ideas from such thinkers as foucault kafka nietzsche herbert marcuse and eduard von hartmann permeate the works of writers such as chuck palahniuk michael szymczyk and charles bukowski and one often finds in such works a delicate balance between distastefulness and beauty. in cinema postmodern editing techniques showing the displacement discontinuity and temporal perspective of postmodernism can go hand-in-hand with a purely existential story thus synthesizing technique and function to give meaning. moreover this has created the neologism neo-existentialism- combining postmodernism's epistemology with the reflective ontological belief of existentialism. the acclaimed  film taxi driver starring robert deniro is perhaps one of the most widely known existential films. the film was heavily influenced by dosteovsky's notes from underground and even quotes dosteovsky in the line: im god's lonely man. the  film the machinist is also influenced by dosteovsky's work especially the double: a petersburg poem the idiot and the brothers karamazov. in one scene in the film star christian bale is seen reading a copy of the idiot. the  film deliverance as well as the  book of the same name has also been credited as existentialist as have the  film fight club club and  film donnie darko. major concepts in existentialism existentialism differentiates itself from the modern western rationalist tradition of philosophers such as descartes and husserl in rejecting the idea that the most certain and primary reality is rational consciousness. descartes believed humans could doubt all existence but could not will away or doubt the thinking consciousness whose reality is therefore more certain than any other reality. existentialism decisively rejects this argument asserting instead that as conscious beings humans always find themselves already in a world a prior context and history that is given to consciousness and in which it is situated and that humans cannot think away that world. it is inherent and indubitably linked to consciousness. in other words the ultimate certain indubitable reality is not thinking consciousness but according to heidegger being in the world. this is a radicalization of the notion of intentionality that comes from brentano and husserl which asserts that even in its barest form consciousness is always conscious of something. on the existence of god sartre unlike kierkegaard denies the existence of god. sartre argues that without god there is no higher power to define man. however there are versions of existentialism that are religious. theological existentialism as advocated by philosophers and theologians like paul tillich gabriel marcel and martin buber posits god's existence as well as accepting many tenets of atheistic existentialism. belief in god is a personal choice made on the basis of a passion of faith an observation or experience. just as atheistic existentialists can freely choose not to believe theistic existentialists can freely choose to believe in god and could despite one's doubt have faith that god exists and that god is good. a third type of existentialism is agnostic. again it is a matter of choice to be agnostic. the agnostic existentialist makes no claim to know or not know if there is a greater picture in play rather he simply recognizes that the greatest truth is that which he chooses to act upon. the agnostic existentialist feels that to know the greater picture whether there is one or not is impossible for human minds--or if it is not impossible that at least he has not found it yet. like christian existentialists the agnostic believes existence is subjective. however one feels about the issue the act of finding knowledge of the existence of god often has little value because he feels it to be impossible and believes it is useless. as mentioned above philosophers associated with existentialism vary sometimes greatly over what existentialism is and even if there is such a thing as existentialism. one version sartrean existentialism is elaborated below. some of the tenets associated with the existentialism of jean-paul sartre include:  existence precedes essence: this is a reversal of the aristotlean premise that essence precedes existence where man is created to fulfil some telos and life consists of fulfilling that goal. unlike tools that are created to fulfill a purpose e.g. a scissor is created for the express purpose of cutting things sartrean existentialism argues man exists without purpose finds himself in the world and defines the meaning of his existence.  identities are constructed by the individual consciousness only: as an extension of the first tenet the individual consciousness constructs a self or identity for itself. an identity can include beliefs projects and various other things of value. sartre argues that no one else including god if he existed can choose your identity for you. kierkegaard's knight of faith and nietzsche's bermensch are some such examples of those who create their own identity.  values are subjective: sartre accepts the premise that something is valuable because the individual consciousness chooses to value it. sartre denies there are any objective standards on which to base values.  responsibility for choices: the individual consciousness is responsible for all the choices he makes regardless of the consequences. sartre claims that to deny the responsibility is to be in bad faith faith. here existentialists draw on psychological concepts to investigate feelings such as angst and despair that arise by being in bad faith. kierkegaard's works the concept of anxiety and the sickness unto death are works that deal with such feelings.  condemned to be free: because our actions and choices are ours and ours alone we are condemned to be responsible for our free choices. there are several terms sartre uses in his works. being in-itself are objects that are not free and cannot change its essence. being for-itself are free: it does not need to be what it is and can change into what it is not. consciousness is usually considered being for-itself. sartre distinguishes between positional and non-positional consciousness. non positional consciousness is being merely conscious of one's surroundings. positional consciousness puts consciousness into relation of one's surroundings. this entails an explicit awareness of being conscious of one's surroundings. sartre argues identity is constructed by this explicit awareness of consciousness. in repetition kierkegaard's literary character young man laments: :how did i get into the world? why was i not asked about it why was i not informed of the rules and regulations but just thrust into the ranks as if i had been bought by a peddling shanghaier of human beings? how did i get involved in this big enterprise called actuality? why should i be involved? isn't it a matter of choice? and if i am compelled to be involved where is the manageri have something to say about this. is there no manager? to whom shall i make my complaint?  namerepkierkegaard sren. repetition in kierkegaard's writings vol.  princeton university press  building on this heidegger and later sartre dubbed the term throwness to describe this idea that human beings are exposed to or thrown into existence  in that we have no choice to come into existence. existentialists consider being thrown into existence as prior to and the horizon or context of any other thoughts or ideas that humans have or definitions of themselves that they create. this explanation of existentialism strongly favors a non-religious approach. even in quoting kierkegaard a christian existentialist his words are used to support the anxiety and nothingness of the philosophy which are definitely two fundamental elements but not any more important than free will and decision. herbert marcuse criticized existentialism especially in sartre's being and nothingness for projecting certain features of living in a modern oppressive society such as anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: in so far as existentialism is a philosophical doctrine it remains an idealistic doctrine: it hypothesizes specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks and its radicalism is illusory marcuse herbert. sartres existentialism. printed in studies in critical philosophy. translated by joris de bres. london: nlb . p. . theodor adorno in his jargon of authenticity criticized heidegger's philosophy with special attention to his use of language as a mystifying ideology of advanced industrial society and its power structure. roger scruton claimed in his book from descartes to wittgenstein that both heidegger's concept of authenticity and sartre's concept of sartre and bad faith were incoherent both deny any universal moral creed yet speak of these concepts as if everyone were bound to abide them. in chapter  he writesin what sense sartre is able to recommend the authenticity which consists in the purely self-made morality is unclear. he does recommend it but by his own argument his recommendation can have no objective force. familiar with this sort of argument sartre claimed that bad and good faith do not represent moral ideas rather they are ways of being. logical positivists such as carnap and alfred claim that existentialists frequently become confused over the verb to be in their analyses of being. the verb is prefixed to a predicate and to use the word without any predicate is meaningless. borrowing kant's argument against the ontological argument for the existence of god they argue that existence is not a property. sigmund freud whom sartre refuted systematically was very much affected in so many of his theories by nietzsche. some have supposed that thanatos and eros were closely related to dionysian and apollonian aspects of nietzsche philosophy. one of the major offshoots of existentialism as a philosophy is existential psychology. sometimes termed the third force psychology this branch of psychology was initiated by rollo may and carl ransom rogers both of whom were influenced by kierkegaard. with complete freedom to decide and being responsible for the outcome of said decisions comes anxiety--or angst--about the choices made. anxiety's importance in existentialism makes it a popular topic in psychotherapy. therapists often use existential philosophy to explain the patient's anxiety. psychotherapists using an existential approach believe that the patient can harness his or her anxiety and use it constructively. instead of suppressing anxiety patients are advised to use it as grounds for change. by embracing anxiety as inevitable a person can use it to achieve his or her full potential in life. humanistic psychology also had major impetus from existential psychology. logotherapy asserts that all human beings have a will to find meaning and that serious behavioral problems develop when they cannot find it. the therapy helps patients handle the responsibility of choices and the pain of unavoidable suffering by helping them decide to give life meaning. terror management theory is a developing area of study within the academic study of psychology. it looks at what researchers claim to be the implicit emotional reactions of people when confronted with the psychological terror of knowing we will eventually die. existentialism in popular culture the burlesque existentialist is a stock character of the popular imagination dressed in black and uttering gnomic assertions about life and the universe. existentialism was in paul jennings uk jennings's theory of resistentialism. during the witty introduction sequence of the  film love in the afternoon  in the afternoon it is said that even existentialists make love in paris. the  film i heart  huckabees revolved around two existential detectives who aimed to help people solve their
