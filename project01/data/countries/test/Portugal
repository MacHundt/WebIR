42	all life on earth is based on carbon and water. a lot of people alternative. ammonia-based lifeforms are also though more infrequently considered. silicon-based life is generally regarded as improbable by most scientists. on the surface the chemistries of carbon and silicon are similar. just as carbon can form methane ch silicon can form silane sih and both elements can form long chains of polymers. but silicon's affinity for oxygen means that it cannot easily be used for respiration. whereas co is a gas that can easily be removed from the organism sio is a solid that will instantly organize itself into lattices making it hard to dispose of. on top of that silicon fails to give rise to many compounds that exhibit chirality which is a common feature of carbon-based molecules that is essential to the proper functioning of enzymes. there is also astronomical evidence to suggest that silicon-based life is unlikely. wherever astronomers have looked they have failed to find the simplest precursors to silicon-based biochemistry: whereas complex carbon-based compounds are abundant in space most of what we have observed in space are simple oxides of silicon with no record of more complex molecules such as silanes and silicones. 
42	most life on earth is based on water and its numerous chemical properties and indeed a large portion of modern chemistry is devoted to the study of aqueous solutions. however a lot of chemical reactions exist that take place in an ammonia solution: liquid ammonia has some chemical similarities with water and as such it has been theorized that ammonia-based life forms might be possible. ammonia can dissolve most organic molecules at least as well as water does and in addition it is capable of dissolving many elemental metals. 
42	on the other hand ammonia does have some problems as a basis for life. the heat of vaporization of ammonia is half that of water and its surface tension three times smaller. this means that hydrogen bonds between ammonia molecules will always be much weaker than those in water so ammonia is less able to concentrate non-polar molecules through a hydrophobic effect. lacking this ability mainstream science questions how well ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together in order to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system.
