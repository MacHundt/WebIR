142052843	17539655	Re : Did anyone else almost cry ?	I never cry at films . There are many films that take me to the verge of tears , but there's a barrier between that and crying that i never usually get over . Yet I just watched AI , and the tears are still wet on my face . I never expected that Spielberg of all people would be able to do this to me .
142016310	17539655	Re : Dont see this film if you want a comedy	Why do people think films have to fit into just one genre ? ? There were so many funny moments in this film ! ! But there was also drama and at the end i was almost crying , it was so sweet . It had more than one dimension to it , which is what made it so good .
137632559	17539655	Re : No appeal to 15-25 year olds .	I'm 18 and I loved it . Maybe some of the 80s stuff was lost on me , but I thought it was hilarious and touching from start to finish . And I thought the cool special effects stuff that the kids came up with were much more exciting than hollywood ones !
138807061	17539655	Re : Very Poor Ending	Yep , I have to agree To be honest , I often like films where there is no need for there to be a driving plot . And the majority of this this film seemed to just be about love and discovery . And I liked that , maybe just because I'm a teenager ? But at the end it seemed like the writer panicked and thought something big needed to happen for the audience to leave feeling the film was significant . The ending didn't fit at all with the rest of the film , and I want to forget that it happened really . As someone said in their review , someone should edit the film and remove the ending .
140395804	17539655	Re : Did anyone cry at the end ?	I watched it again , just now And I still have tears in my eyes I saw it a few years ago , and I don't remember the ending being so strong

130211053	6517255	Re : saw him today !	So when did you graduate ? I graduated in 1987 from BHS . His family and mine have always been friends . . . his grandfather attended my mother's funeral . Danny and his family are all very nice people and while I haven't had the pleasure of meeting his family since I am no longer in Bfd , my parents say they are beautiful . Danny , if you're reading this , take care , my friend ! We enjoy watching a " friend " on GL . Sandi Pan . . .
154417856	539755	The money in the bathtub ?	What was the significance of Salim's act of filling the bathtub with money at the end before he was killed ? It looked like LOTS of Rupees , couldn't he have given it to Latika as she fled ? I guess he knew he was going to die and wanted his own blood spilled on it since it was his blood money he earned from the crime boss ?

149019321	539755	Re : Love his name !	In the US the name " Brawley " is almost as popular as " Punchey " and " Fightey " . Also popular is " Feudey " and " Altercationey " .
12865763	539755	Re : Am I the only one who 1 . loved this move 2 . knows about it	I agree with tremorx22 , J . T . Walsh gives a creepy cold-blooded performance , and the plot gives a growing suffocating feeling as you wonder what Kurt Russel's next moves could possibly be . Check it out if you can , Mostow also did a decent job on Terminator 3 .
122434804	539755	Lindsay Lohan	Lindsay Lohan looks directly into the camera THREE TIMES in her first scene . In other scenes she looks like she's struggling to not look into the lens . Why wasn't she nominated for a fifth Razzie for this performance ?
35295743	337755	Finally ! A Ford film that sounds promising !	Ever since ' The Fugitive , ' it seems like people have just sort of danced around Harrison Ford's subsequent films politely . ' Sabrina ' was sweet , ' Air Force One ' was harmless summer action , ' Six Days , Seven Nights ' was fun , ' What Lies Beneath ' was kinda scary and he got to play a bad guy , ' K-19 ' was well-intentioned , ' Hollywood Homicide ' let him have a good time , ' Firewall ' is the kind of dramatic , tortured film Ford is good at . . . It's all just dancing around how the man has not made a daring or just-plain critically applauded film in a long time and could do with a serious , elevated film that is more than just a popcorn flick . If there's anyone whose films I want to be able to get behind completely , it's Harrison Ford , but he makes some bizarre choices sometimes , bizarre because on the surface he seems so very picky . ' Manhunt ' sounds to me like it could be a real winner .
59942907	337755	Re : Should air on network TV again !	Oh , definitely , that was great - CBS had been doing it so long , the Garfield special had become a holiday tradition in its own right and was in the top 30 every time . Instead of tacking on mediocre new Peanuts cartoons to the timeless originals ABC should get the rights to at least the three Halloween , Thanksgiving and Christmas specials . As far as I'm concerned , the Garfield Christmas special should still be part of people's childhoods just as much as Charlie Brown , Rudolph , the Grinch and Frosty have been .
62470126	337755	Re : I looked this guy's name up on Google Image Search . . . .	You might be able to find one perusing the head writer for ' Garfield and Friends ' website : http povonline com Garfield htm Even if you can't find one , it's a great site . There are definitely pictures of Thom in the Garfield 25th Anniversary book ( " In Dog Years I'd Be Dead " or something to that effect is the title ) . It's too bad he hasn't done more work as an actor . He's a really gifted voice artist .
7489251	337755	Re : Why no DVD release ?	None of David E . Kelley's shows has had a full DVD release .

16945118	337755	Re : UK Club Med ad	What a good site ! The adverts in the UK are wonderful ( I actually stayed for a time with a Spanish family in Oxford , and the mother would always flip from commercial break to commercial break just to see the ads - to hell with ' The West Wing .

70978979	337755	Re : I feel kinda sorry for this guy	In regards to " Doctor Who , " it's not impossible for the BBC to someday do a one-off TV special depicting an 8th Doctor adventure , perhaps his final one involving the TIme War . When one considers they've done two Christmas specials , two spinoffs , two documentary series and still maintained 8 million viewers for the third season premiere . . . surely the novelty of such a marketable idea has dawned on them .
11684382	337755	Re : 6 degrees of Meg Ryan	Chow Yun-fat was in ' Anna and the King ' with Jodie Foster . Jodie Foster was in ' The Silence of the Lambs ' with Anthony Heald . Anthony Heald was in ' Proof of Life ' with Meg Ryan . ( or Anthony Hopkins is in ' Papa ' next year ) Next : Joel Grey
126459987	337755	Re : Offered ' Bergerac '	No idea , but he certainly was one for putting a bold stamp on things whenever possible . Apparently he regretted not taking the show over a little , but I don't know more than that .
97239972	337755	Re : Why Do Bette Davis fans Hate Celeste ?	Bette Davis fans probably just like stoking the fire - the idea of two steely divas facing off against each other lends itself to picking sides and sitting down with popcorn until the fight is over .
68554209	337755	Re : Best story off the 9 ?	" The Soldier and Death " for me as well . I love every puppet in that episode . It's so unexpected and wonderful to have this series out on DVD .

73847064	337755	Re : the Michael jackson poster	It's hilarious , although at the time it was shot , the joke was merely meant to play off of Michael Jackson's weirdness and the cloy nature of " Heal the World . " Obviously it's taken on another angle over the last decade .
22053688	337755	Re : It - is - interesting . . .	I completely agree about Bill Nighy being a great choice . They should not be echewing older actors - Tennant will be fine , but he looks like a 12 year old pixie boy . Such a shame that Eccleston didn't stay longer - the BBC really shot themselves in the foot with that development ( what to do with all those 9th Doctor toys at Xmas ? ) Another person who would have been great : Hugh Laurie . Until ' House , ' I couldn't see him playing someone who was smart , irascible and glib , but sure enough , now I can see him making a great Doctor .
166255821	337755	Re : Bad Acting ?	Even Russell T Davies has said the Martha unrequited love arc wasn't a great idea . I think it was just too overtly written to make it workable for any actor . Too much pining out loud , it's not very natural , and you need more grounded human behavior to balance out the fantasy on Doctor Who and to really sell the companions these days . But I still say she knocked a lot out of thr park , particularly the Human Nature two parter , and her character as originally conceived was very strong . Looking forward to more from Freema .
141790820	337755	Re : Michael Jackson leak	It's difficult to accept the idea that a child could ever lie or that anyone could sully the reputation of an already scrutinized celebrity in order to engage in blackmail ( and think he or she could get away with it ) , but Michael Jackson was always quick to try to stamp out any controversies he was embroiled in , unwittingly or not , and that was common knowledge as far back as 1993 when these allegations occurred . The criminal trial certainly painted a picture of a family with a history of false accusation using a child as the unimpeachable offended party . Jackson was an easy target , and it's not unfair to say his behavior was at best questionable , but I defy anyone to be able to distinguish his clueless eccentricities from his cunning stratagems or his childlike naivete from his willful ignorance . The man's childhood was uniquely its own , and the damage it wrought on him was manifested in ways that went from brilliant nerve as a performer to a tragic misalignment of his own perception . I can't begin to decide how to define him , how to determine if he was an innocent manchild offstage who was easily taken advantage of , or if he was a warped darker seed who did not practice what he preached . I think we'd all prefer to have an answer in black or white , but as always , Jackson frustrated us by seeming to be both and neither , and that may always be the case . No one can ever declare Jackson's innocence with any certainty , but that's the very crux of a good accusation - the accused gets to spend the rest of his time in full damage control and the accuser benefits from justice at best and a blood reward at worst .
159996937	337755	Re : I miss her old looks . . .	Correct me if I'm wrong , but I remember Dana Delany once being able to fully open her mouth when she said her lines . There's something off about how she seems to struggle to do so now .
15125039	337755	UK Club Med ad	Shown here only as of one of ABC's recent specials extolling entertaining commercials , this apparently aired in the UK in the late nineties . It's very well-made , sweet and a bit sad , and Connor Trinneer is . . . I guess ' adorable ' is the word ? Anyway , it's a fun thing to see , this is the only website I've found that carries a copy . http triptpolers houseoftucker com miscellany connor trinneer photos shtml
18137487	337755	Recommend ?	Anyone who likes Hugh Laurie in ' Blackadder ' will immediately take a liking to him in ' Jeeves and Wooster . ' Fans of the more light-hearted ' Mystery ! ' shows like ' Hetty Wainthropp ' or the period and sophisticated ' Poirot ' might like it as well , but only if they don't mind upper-class buffoons and screwball comedy ( probably the closest genre you can peg this show to ) being thrown into the mix rather liberally . There are some elements of ' Are You Being Served ? ' ( many antiquated ideas about behavior and custom are satirized ) , but I would agree with those who have said it is not like any other British comedy in the end though - it combined the lovable doltishness of Laurie's comedy acting with Stephen Fry's sage and patient wit , and adapts some charming and fun stories of Wodehouse's on film ( ! ) without the distraction of a laugh track . The only real minuses of the series IMO are the revolving door of guest stars playing the same character from season to season and the uneven nature of season 4 . But it really is a unique , funny and entertaining series .

61918227	337755	Re : A remake ? ! ?	It's a really good script though . The producers love the original , the talent they are seeking out is not of the Jim Carrey variety , the proposed director is a great choice and Lloyd's granddaughter is very much involved and very protective of his legacy . A good remake creates renewed interest in the original . Harold Lloyd is sorely out of the public's awareness , and a project like this could well help to change that .

64766712	337755	Re : Missed the very end . . .	Oh , I recorded it when it aired ! But first I had to get all the others together first - not entirely essential considering her teams and romances change all the time , but the character progression is much more satisfying when seen from the beginning . Bought the first two outright , borrowed 3 , 4 and 6 ( I figured 5 was the most dispensible ) and then finally watched the final one . It was an excellent end - very believable and quietly dignified .
70826107	337755	Re : Status ?	Hell . The man just never follows through with the interesting projects , for whatever reasons . Sure , I want to see " Indy IV , " but I'd also have liked to see him in this promising movie or " A Walk Among the Tombstones .

72839882	337755	Re : Why can't they give it up ?	I don't think it will hurt to remind people of the mess they had to deal with for 7 years . Perhaps that will affect them at the polls in 11 / 08 .

16293774	337755	Re : what happened to kurt matt and brian ?	Was there some especially lazy contract negotiating at work for this series ? One would think that none of the actors was binded to a proper multi-year contract - I wouldn't think it was creative reasons which prompted the ouster of the best characters over the course of 3 years . ' Teachers ' outstripped ' NYPD Blue ' in the cast turnover department in a third as many seasons .
42317875	337755	Re : about this movie	The film is about an ex-con whose late twin brother ran the family business making custom wooden furniture . The living brother comes back home and deals with his estranged father , his frustrated sister-in-law and his impressionable nephew . At the same time , he tries to run the family business , a frustrating task considering he actually is more talented than his brother was , but with such a terrible reputation he cannot stir up business without lying . The film just screened at Tribeca .
7933455	337755	Re : Is anyone but me watching this show ?	I seriously think a profitable TV movie could be made out of this . Eric Close and Dennis Haysbert have higher profiles now , the only wild card is Heather Matarrazo ( sp ? ) . She may have aged too much .
92690755	337755	Just be Doctor Who already !	If and when David Tennant leaves the series , could we please finally have the promise of Bill Nighy as The Doctor be fulfilled ? Where does it say that in the new series the title actor must be under 50 ? He's so sprightly and delightfully eccentric and playful , I can't think of any other actor today who is as well-suited to the role . Barring that , could he at least do a turn as Tennant's Doctor's son ? That would at least make for some marvelous comedy .

158624530	337755	Re : Anyone else would have liked NOT to have Harrison Ford in the film ?	Funnily enough , that was Ford's reason for turning down Neeson's role in " Schindler's List " - his fame / persona would have been distracting . But were it not for Harrison Ford's involvement in producing / development , it's doubtful this movie would have ever gotten made .
18365356	337755	Eh .	Can I just say that I am so tired of Rosie O'Donnell playing herself in movies ? She needs to branch out and actually play a different character .
3336662	337755	So what's next ?	I would like to see this woman do some high profile work soon . I see she has one supporting role in a movie in the can , but I could easily see this woman carrying a good romantic comedy or drama film if she doesn't join the cast of another TV series ( TV Guide recommended her to be Maris on ' Frasier . ' I could see that . ) I don't think costarring with Harrison Ford on anything would be the best idea ( although I would not be one of those protesting a potential role in Indiana Jones IV ) . She's a charming and very capable actress .
23905058	337755	DVD gripe	No doubt the Elton John song might have cost a little extra , but the trailer to this movie is so wonderful , it really deserves to be on the DVD , especially considering how much better it is than the actual film IMO . http www moviecentre net upcomingmovies trailer 859 php

157410155	337755	Re : Bridges is a natural but Farrell spoils this !	Horrid ? I just don't see that . I think too many people resent Colin Farrell's meteoric rise to fame and equate his past questionable taste in scripts with an unsavory assessment of his talent as an actor . One has only to see " Tigerland , " " In Bruges " and " The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus " to see that he's got immense talent and charisma to burn . Just because he happened to say yes to some bad scripts , I think anyone would find themselves hard-pressed to say " No " to working with Michael Mann , Oliver Stone , Woody Allen , Samuel L Jackson , Bruce Willis , Al Pacino and Edward Norton . More often than not , I find him to be very engaging , but then again I also don't begrudge Tom Cruise , Russell Crowe or Mel Gibson for their offscreen drama either .

164523637	337755	Re : ' Innocent '	As a dispassionate devil's advocate , I would say that any charismatic A-lister could replace his character . But I did love Raul Julia and of course he'd be missed , particularly if a new character was just a carbon copy of Sandy's personality
31866290	337755	Re : Why isn't SHE Julia Roberts ?	I admire Ms . Ormond more as an actress , but I would not disparage Julia Roberts in order to praise her . Roberts does her fair share of artistic and independent films , and is not even doing any films for the next few months in order to do theater work , so I would never characterize her as an actress with much less elevated artistic aspirations .
27280934	337755	Re : BBC America ? Ever ?	Amazon . co . uk won't ship DVDs here ? If that's true , that is a new development - I bought my copies of series 1 and 2 from them a year or so ago . I know it's still possible to buy music internationally at least , but I've not tried to buy a DVD recently . You might want to check again and go through the process right to the checkout step . ebay is always an option , and some of the amazon . co . uk marketplace sellers will ship internationally . Now that the show has been aired here , an R1 DVD might come out , but I've looked in vain for other series like ' State of Play ' stateside .
147267827	337755	Re : It's really very good	Count me as one of those who discovered this show out of curiosity aimed at the next season of " Doctor Who " starring Matt Smith , but I came away most impressed by Andrew Buchan and Shelley Conn . I can't understand why critics might have been mixed - it's really very engrossing television . The Danny / Scott and Scott / Ashika relationships are well portrayed ( the former in particular - sibling love / rivalry , living under dad's shadow , bickering , horseplay - so right on the nose and compelling ) , Scott and Ashika's respective character arcs are mapped out believably and the sprinkling of political banter works , though I do think it's a bit impenetrable sometimes , due mostly to the speed at which everyone delves into the topics . Some of the soapy aspects to do with betrayals , affairs and one night stands and stalkers etc . aren't amazing , but it's a well-directed and briskly written series which I'd love to have seen continue .
53975855	337755	Re : Sarah Jane Investigates	Well , it does seem to be fantastical , and very youth oriented , as it is airing on CBBC . I was really hoping for a solid , non-fantasy mystery series starring Elisabeth Sladen . K-9 is in the pilot only . Fingers crossed it's not too bad !
158721017	337755	Re : Harrison Ford : Worst fake accent ever ?	The uproar over Valkyrie really got me thinking about it - Tom Cruise was surrounded by British actors playing Germans but he got all the accent flak . If he'd done a German accent it would gave sounded absurd . If he'd adopted a British accent it would have been just as pointless if you stopped to think about it . If he had only been a producer it might never have been made , to say nothing for it grossing $200 million . Harrison Ford in K-19 is similar , but creatively I think they had to go the accent route - in all honesty I think the distraction wears off - it's a solid movie !
36945445	337755	Re : Great Actress	I imagine if I were a producer on that film I would have been torn between Judi Dench and someone like Penelope Keith . Judi Dench is well-known and respected ( and for good reason ) and surely has box office clout , but I have to say I'm a little sick of seeing her in what seems to be - everything - that requires a late-middle aged British woman . Penelope Keith would have been a lovely and less over-exposed choice IMO . Ah well .

I quite liked the show - it struck me as ' Ally McBeal ' meets ' Boston Public ' but . . . dirtier ? I suppose if it doesn't come here I could always buy the DVD . And a universal player . Hey , it's a better reason to get one than my friend who bought one expressly to watch ' Westlife ' videos .
12584716	337755	Pretty good Nielsen ratings	From http www syfyportal com article php id 1535 ' Farscape ' Pulls In Impressive Audience Author : Michael Hinman Date : 10-19-2004 Source : Watch Farscape While it didn't get the same numbers that " Battlestar Galactica " did last December on the Sci-Fi Channel , one thing producers for " Farscape : Peacekeeper Wars " can say about that " Galactica " only had to deal with Cylons . . . John Crichton ( Ben Browder ) and crew had to face baseball playoffs and high-rated television series on other networks . The four-hour miniseries , shown last weekend on the Sci-Fi Channel , pulled in some 2 million viewers both nights in its original run , showing that there definitely is life left on Moya . According to a press release from the Sci-Fi Channel , Sunday night's broadcast pulled in a 1 . 5 rating on the cable channel , showing huge increases for viewership in that timeslot from just one year before . The first night of " Farscape " bumped Sci-Fi's audience by 88 percent overall , and more than 163 percent in the key 25 - to 54-year-old age demographic . Those 18-49 were drawn in as well , as Sci-Fi saw a 202 percent jump in that demo . What was more impressive was the fact that more people tuned in for the first broadcast of part two , than showed up for the first part . The last two hours of " Farscape " earned a 1 . 9 rating , equating to more than 2 million viewers , up 30 percent over the previous night . The show was a ratings winner for Sci-Fi , making it the highest-rated cable network in those key demographics for the two nights . It beat out TNT , TBS and SpikeTV . While the initial ratings numbers don't account for encore showings of the mini , Sci-Fi Channel officials said some 7 million pairs of eyes were on " Farscape " over the weekend . So , what will come next for " Farscape " ? It's hard to tell . Sci-Fi Channel canceled the show prematurely in 2002 . Thanks to numerous well-organized fan campaigns , The Jim Henson Co . - - which produces " Farscape " - - found private funding , and put together the four-hour miniseries . While Sci-Fi Channel did pick up the miniseries for its original air , it is unclear whether the network will order more telemovies or miniseries based on the Rockne O'Bannon series in the future . Such a decision would likely be made next year . As for a series revival ? That , too , remains a possibility . The miniseries finished with stronger numbers than what " Farscape " had before it was canceled , but it will be up to studio heads whether the series itself could see a comeback . The increased ratings for part 2 are encouraging - that was one of the biggest deciding factors with ' Battlestar Gallactica ' becoming a new series . Hopefully the viewer reactions and DVD sales of the series and mini will encourage Sci-Fi to order more !
24658829	337755	Re : BBC America ? Ever ?	I ended up caving in and buying seasons 1 and 2 on R2 DVD , but it is wonderful to see the series in America . Now , if someone would post a comprehensive soundtrack listing of every episode , he or she would do a lot of fans a world of good ! ! ; )
141476194	337755	New audio production ?	I've been hearing rumors that the BBC has finally convinced him to do a new series of radio plays for this fall as the 4th Doctor , something Big FInish was never able to do .
36918811	337755	Re : REMAKE !	It's in limbo , but still in the works .
8060379	337755	Cheesy trailer , but likely a great film	Based on how exquisite Annaud's ' The Bear ' is , and knowing the tendencies of studios to mismarket unusual films , I am confident this is indeed a fine film . I hope it wasn't too expensive , for a fear it won't make a big sum of money without the same kind of critical push and buzz that ' The Bear ' had - the trailer has no latitude for adults .
17144731	337755	Re : Its terrible	But I'm right , aren't I ?
65399492	337755	Director's Cut ?	Does this still exist ? Probably the best incentive to giving this variable film more attention is a new Director's Cut , since Chaplin was apparently displeased with the theatrical version .
24057989	337755	Re : Colin Farrell	Sorry for the late reply , I don't follow any threads except when someone happens to reply directly to my posts . I met Schumacher at an NBR screening of ' The Phantom of the Opera , ' and after he and everyone else answered mundane and pointless questions from the other board members he mentioned ' The Crowded Room ' as a project he wanted to do , and I did get the chance to congratulate him on ' Tigerland , ' ( he lamented the nonexistent promotion ) .
17302549	337755	Re : Walk On Water	God , I felt kinda bad to be thinking the same thing through most of the movie - ' The lead guy is really hot ! ' I had no idea what the movie was about before I saw it , I was surprised that it involved some gay themes .
110102345	337755	Re : Possiblity of McGann as the next Doctor ( as the 8th , not the 11th ) ?	There are a helluva lot of strong rumors going around that McGann features in as many as three of the upcoming DW specials as the 8th Doctor , acting either alongside Tennant or in flashbacks .
14602308	337755	Re : Anyone else heard other Robbie Williams ' ' swing ' music ?	Perfect choice to do that song . His bits in the DVD featurette are fun too . He actually did sing a redition of a Cole Porter song before ' Swing When You're Winning ' too - one of the B-sides to the ' Lazy Days ' single is ' Every Time We Say Goodbye . '
11338067	337755	Re : Lexie Vs Katrina !	Making Katrina out to be a bitch IMO was a ploy to make Lexie look all the nicer , considering she was the one that would stay on the series , and it'd do no good to have her be unlikeable . It didn't sit all that well with me , especially since IMO Lexie had a distinctively conniving streak in her early on , a trait which has been conveniently buried now .
165309269	337755	Re : Suchet : : ' Will film Poirot's death . '	In January it was looking like ITV might cancel Poirot again and " Orient Express " was being treated as a finale . I'd love for that to not be the case , but has this been stated anywhere else ?

71135883	337755	Re : George Bush	While Will Ferrell's Bush wasn't exactly an astute impersonation ( whereas Darrell Hammond's Al Gore is frighteningly good ) , it was very entertaining and sparing . The writing for Bush since Ferrell left has been woeful , which is a shame when one considers how golden the material is . Sudeikis is a step up from Forte's whiny Bush , but they need to take the character out of the Oval Office setting to make things more interesting than a speech to the camera that won't be biting enough or terribly funny .
11695817	337755	Re : Original vs American Version - AGHHHH ! !	I'll be curious to know if the US DVD is indeed the Miramax cut , and if the UK DVD is a different version . IMO it makes no sense to release a cut version , wonderful as it still may be - the audience interested in buying this on DVD are either people like us who have known the movie for some time and would be that much more eager to see the original cut , or fans of the remake who wouldn't be put off by an extra fifteen minutes they are spending watching TV and not in a theater .
149954760	337755	Re : finally a peter weir film	Didn't Weir back out of " The War Magician " because the facts behind it were dubious ? Bit of a similar case here , interestingly enough .
82963564	337755	Re : Happy 87th Birthday ! !	She's actually 90 now . 20th Century Fox shaved 2 years off her age when she was under contract with them and she's only started correcting people now . ; )
72840391	337755	Re : Sonia Ganguli - sister	Sorry , but that's a pretty untoward comment . Say what you want about the role and performance , but there's no need to denigrate the actress .
162995960	337755	Re : Last episode of current series my favourite	Yes , just about pitch-perfect . I really never want to see this show end .
26967560	337755	Re : Why Tony ? WHY ! ? ? !	Yes , there are so many , I just lumped them together . But since you named them , be sure to include ' King of the Hill , ' it is reliable and high quality , and its creator also produces ' The Office ' on NBC .
64741368	337755	Re : Oh no , not again	I can't say I'm enjoying these adaptations , particularly ones like these which , as you say , aren't even Marple stories . The main character gets marginalized by less interesting ones throughout as a result . I'll watch this one for Tom Baker , but IMO they've really dropped the ball with this series as a whole .

69150399	337755	Re : people want Owen to die ! ! !	I'd be perfectly fine with Owen getting killed off and an equally blunt and slimey new character coming in to fill his shoes .

16755199	337755	Re : Did anybody watch this before LOTR ?	I did actually watch quite a few ' Hetty Wainthropp ' episodes before ' Lord of the Rings , ' so it was nice to be able to recognize Dominic when the films came out . It's also nice to know that the success of those films and of ' Lost ' will get more people to discover this series - it's a change of pace from those behemoths , but everyone , Dominic included , gives fine performances in some very charming little stories . It's interesting , actually , how many big stars can be traced back to shows which wound up on PBS - most recently , I remember seeing Colin Farrell on ' Ballykissangel ' and Clive Owen on ' Second Sight ' before the waves of hype and fame in America swooped over them . It's a shame that PBS's budget is for whatever reason not able to support newer quality imports of that kind anymore - they can't even do ' Mystery ! ' and ' Masterpiece Theatre , ' which is a crying shame .
58601004	337755	Re : who will play booth ?	I'd say Christian Bale , Ryan Gosling and Edward Norton are great choices , but is this movie even on the fast track ? Whenever Harrison Ford talks about his plans these days it's always ' Indiana Jones ' prospects . It would be nice if this film could be filmed ( and perhaps released ) before the next ' National Treasure ' movie which has a plot related to Booth .
36468267	337755	Re : Will Ferrell in a drama ?	He does very well in this film . It's a very sweet , restrained and promising performance .
31178664	337755	Re : KC to have 9 unaired episodes	This does suck . Fox did not give the show a chance in that timeslot . I think the best course of action though is to petition 20th Century Fox , rather than the network . Petition the TV studio to offer the show on DVD so we can at least see all those unaired episodes !
7915433	337755	Re : sean astin ! ! ! omg ! ! ! ! babe ! ! !	Is it just me , or is this movie blatantly homo-erotic ? It seems like every other scene of the guys hanging out together has them in various states of undress , nursing each other's wounds , stuffing things down each other's pants etc . At the least it is blatantly trying to get horny teens to shiver with excitement , that ' shower ' bit with Sean Astin included . No complaints , just an observation .
20044332	337755	Re : At least it wasn't as bad as The Body in the Library	I do like how McEwan injects a bit of impish mischeviousness into Miss Marple , but I do agree she doesn't seem quite right in the role .
161640194	337755	Re : DVD	For a quick fix , it is on iTunes , no clue if it's subtitled or dubbed - but the trailer is good fun . Also can be rented there and on amazon .
68931523	337755	Re : Is this a joke ? ? ?	The pilot director has a lot of say in the casting for the series regulars . I assume Singer's track record for successful casting ( frequently for adaptations or remakes ) was a big factor and will affect the whole series .
18197624	337755	What ? No discussion ?	This is a film produced by HBO written by one of the most successful and some might say greatest romantic comedy movie writers of all time , directed by the man who helmed the intriguing and taut ' State of Play , ' and no one is even curious ? Come on !
69294141	337755	Re : A Scene for Jadzia Was Written in DS9 Finale !	This makes sense . She showed up for the Wrap Party and did voicework for " The Fallen " video game . Also , " What You Leave Behind " is clearly hurting for lack of a bigger budget . The epic space battle to end all space battles has a huge montage of stock footage , and the streets of Cardassia Prime wind up being a couple very dark and claustrophobic little sets .
15043627	337755	Multi-anchor format ? Katie Couric ? !	I may only speak for myself , but if CBS turns the Evening News into ' The Early Show ' and infuses more of its entertainment programming into it and / or hires Katie Couric , I will be switching to Peter Jennings in a heartbeat . John Roberts is the best qualified person to inherit the throne , and sometimes the ' voice of God ' is just the best way to keep the news streamlined and appropriately serious . Sure , news is a business , but it's also one with a reputation to consider - the Memo incident is proof positive of that . A multi-anchor format doesn't seem to serve much purpose other than a cosmetic way to differentiate .
81757841	337755	Offered ' Bergerac '	I thought this trivia tidbit from the " Doctor Who - Survival " DVD was extremely interesting . Around 1988 or 1989 he was offered the job of taking over producer duties for " Bergerac , " but he said he'd end up firing John Nettles so it never happened . Such an interesting notion , the thought of him overseeing something other than Doctor Who .

18248060	337755	Re : After ' Bewitched , ' what's next ?	I would see another Tom Hanks / Meg Ryan film , if only to see that duo again ( although part of me would like tos ee them in a genre other than romantic comedy ) , ideally one that's appropriate for a couple of middle-aged people searching for love , not a generic romcom that studios would prefer starred Kate Hudson or some other twenty-something who hasn't a real clue about being in love or losing it and struggling to find it at a later age . ' Something's Gotta Give ' was a nice attempt , but there's more to explore in this topic ( though of course it skews a bit younger with Hanks and Ryan ) .

17456273	337755	Re : Why do people hate this ?	The movie is beautifully shot an scored , very expensive-looking and Paul McGann is a great fit for the role . Matthew Jacobs even saved this from Phillip Segal's wackier ideas , so the Master being a bucket of slime and the Doctor being half human is nothing compared to the scrapped ideas about the Master being his brother or Borusa his grandfather etc . Lord knows , the ideas for the subsequent stories would have upset fans far more than this ever did . That said , it has an annoying amount of technobabble to explain its nonsensical plot , and that takes most of the fun out of it . The atomic clock , the Eye of Harmony . . . ay . Also , Eric Roberts is atrocious , playing the Master as the Terminator or hamming it up in just as unbearable a way as Anthony Ainley was frequently encouraged to do . Instead of being a more conventional yarn about invading Daleks or Autons , they went with a fairly uninteresting ' The Eye of Harmony is going to destroy the world ( you can tell because this glass is bending ) unless I can get a clock and flick some switches ! ' path . Definitely a waste of millions of pounds and dollars and some great atmospheric lighting . ; )
60987879	337755	Re : Awful mini series	Patrick Stewart doesn't have the best judgment when it comes to scripts . Don't forget he made ' Masterminds , ' ' Eleventh Hour ' and thought ' Star Trek : Nemesis ' was one of the best Trek films . He's a marvellous actor ( and a tremendous classical stage presence ) and I'd single out his other Robert Halmi collaborations , ' Lion in Winter , ' ' First Contact ' and ' Jeffrey ' as his most recent highlights , but his script choices are IMO a big part of why he hasn't received as many awards as ( or been knighted like ) his colleague , Ian McKellan .
74814973	337755	Re : Better not get nominated for an Emmy	I see no problem with Scott Porter getting a nomination . It's a top of the class performance regardless of his Hollywood stature and age . If fellow neophyte America Ferrera is going to clean up when it comes to nominations , I see no reason why Porter's brutally believable , emotional , physical and nuanced performances can't get some love . I absolutely agree Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton deserve nods ( and due to lesser competition I am almost certain Britton at least will get one ) , but I think recognizing and rewarding young talent is appropriate and indeed important for this publicity-challenged series . It's a gutsy and showy role which requires many different skills than do Gregory House , Tony Soprano or Eric Taylor . I absolutely admire it .
32653677	337755	Re : UK Club Med ad	Maybe one of those numbers you call for song info would work ? You know the ones where you play a song then put the phone to the speaker for and get an automated response ? Might be too obscure , but it's a thought . . .

17455287	337755	Re : McCoy's Sendout	Frankly , I was happy to see McCoy's Doctor die in a rather abrupt and helpless way . The 7th Doctor was so damned smug and in control all the time , it was rather poetic to see him picked off in such a matter of fact and senseless way .
68292201	337755	Re : Marple - Series 3	Yeah . . . I reviewed ' Toward Zero ' on its board . Pretty underwhelming . I'm very curious to know if the Miss Marple short stories have been optioned by anyone . It strikes me as odd how they've never been adapted .

56200994	337755	Re : If you could recast Carrie . . .	Well , they had decent chemistry in ' Mickey Blue Eyes , ' but I've always considered Tripplehorn to be something of a blank slate . She just makes so little an impression on me each and every time I see her in a film . But I really just did not like MacDowell in this film . She just took all of Richard Curtis ' lovely words and failed to filter them through anything to make them at all believable . I look at the way Julia Roberts pulled off tough and sappy ' Notting Hill ' scenes like ' I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy . . . ' or the way actresses like Rachel McAdams and Calista Flockhart seem to mull over their dialogue and embue it with realism - and I keep failing to appreciate the clumsy and forced way MacDowell delivers her lines . Some blame has to go to the director of course , but in all fairness , only Steven Soderbergh and perhaps Harold Ramis wrenched truly good performances out of her ( not even Peter Weir , my favorite helmer can claim that distinction ) . But I truly believe someone like Sandra Bullock or Meg Ryan would have been better able to embue Carrie with the kind of confusion and playfull worldliness the character needed . JMHO .

141530115	337755	Re : Jonas leaving RH	Someone has to explain to me how contracts work . Is it just too prohibitively expensive for British shows to contractually oblige actors to agree to multiple series , or is the very legality of that what sets the UK apart from Hollywood where actors often sign 5 , even 7 year contracts which don't refuse them the right to renegotiate , but technically give studios and networks the upper hand ? It's all very well for a show like " Skins " or " Doctor Who , " where a change in lead actor is actually expected , but with shows which clearly were not planning for lead actors to jump ship so soon like " Robin Hood , " " Teachers , " " Life on Mars " or " Spooks , " it often seems like having a happy exiting lead actor isn't as important as maintaining creative momentum and a fan following . Not every show benefits from a change in cast , most certainly not one where the titular character's actor is being replaced . Heck , I don't even buy the story that Christopher Eccleston was always going to only do one series of " Doctor Who , " it seems more to me like he soured on the show mid-production and the lack of a contractual obligation forced a last-minute rewrite . Regardless , it just seems to me like actors have the upper hand in this particular arena . Is it a lack of money which prevents the execution of forward thinking ?
83089609	337755	Re : Chemistry on STNG between Crusher and Picard	We love new information because Paramount guards it so carefully . It's not like say , " Doctor Who " where there are factual expose-ish books which tell details about behind the scenes drama and unmade stories . The closest Trekkers have had is the various TOS cast autobiographies , the delightfully intricate DS9 Companion and any interview from Ron D Moore ( his interviews re : his tiny stint on Voyager were more informative than 7 years of carefully worded Rick Berman PR ) . This is why I'd even pony up for Berman's book - I know so little about what went on behind the scenes on the modern shows .

There are also the lesbian undertones in the book which Andrew Davies plays up in his adaptation . And personally , I like that the adaptation veers away from the book in giving Tatty one final thing to do - revealing the secret to Arthur . In the book , Amy refuses to tell him and forsakes her fortune so that he may not know what his mother did .

62781933	337755	Re : a genious ?	He's one of the best directors ever to helm a James Bond film , and it's such a shame that he never had better material to work with after " On Her Majesty's Secret Service . " I assume he was blamed for its diminished returns , but no director could have made a film that compensated for the loss of Sean Connery . He cast Diana Rigg and made the tightest , most exciting Bond film to date - he couldn't have done any more .
40564532	337755	Re : Ford is wrong for the part	Well , the fact of the matter is , not that many people have ever even heard of Colonel Conger , so it won't make a scrap of difference . I've read up on the events and persons this film will depict , and yeah , Harrison Ford is twice the age of this character's real-life counterpart , but it's still a movie , not a historical reenactment . It's also likely to be the first truly good ( or at least hopefully successful ) Harrison Ford movie in at least half a decade , so I am not going to complain . Conger isn't really a huge historical figure , and the need to cast him with total specificity is less urgent . Now , Booth on the other hand . . . that needs to be more accurate because of the man's notoriety . I could see Ryan Gosling or Edward Norton . . .

Sure , it's on DVD , but so is the Charlie Brown special , and that's rerun each year to great ratings ( in fact , it's on tonight and it's not even December ) . It got such great ratings each time it aired . ABC really ought to look into buying the Garfield holiday specials as companions to Charlie Brown .

35589815	337755	Re : who will play booth ?	I have to say the idea of Christian Bale , Edward Norton , Ryan Gosling or even Jake Gyllenhaal and Colin Farrell does intrigue me .

They've got the look and the chops , but you'd be forgiven for not remembering it from a really successful movie .

It's much better than its reputation and did not deserve to flop as badly as it did . It's in meager company , but it's almost certainly the best film of Ford's career in the last decade .
8759891	337755	Re : 6 degrees of Meg Ryan	Well , if you want it in exactly 6 degrees , Hart is in ' Not Another Teen Movie , ' with Jessica Biel who was in ' Rules of Attraction ' with Kate Bosworth , who was in ' Blue Crush ' with Matthew Davis , who was in ' Tigerland ' with Colin Farrell , who stars in ' Alexander ' with Anthony Hopkins who stars in ' Papa ' with Meg Ryan . That's six , right ? A shorter way to get to her is : Hart cameoed in ' Can't Hardly Wait , ' with Breckin Meyer , who stared in ' Kate and Leopold ' with Meg Ryan .
62606860	337755	Re : One of my favorites !	It's on DVD now , as are all the primetime specials . I have to say , even watching again after all this time , the panther still scares me a little .
46209114	337755	If you could recast Carrie . . .	. . . whom do you think would have been better ? Besides the obligatory , " Anyone ! " who in 1994 could people see inhabiting this role believably ? Who can you see properly delivering lines about skulking or not noticing rain ? My top picks would be the obvious ones : Sandra Bullock , Julia Roberts , Meg Ryan . Perhaps Michelle Pfeiffer , Uma Thurman or even Melanie Griffith could have pulled it off as well .
158625469	337755	Re : Harrison Ford : Worst fake accent ever ?	Ford's involvement from the get-go was the main reason the film was made in the first place , though . I agree fake accents get in the way a lot . Sometimes you don't notice , but it's usually when Brits and Aussies fake American accents , not the other way around . Hell , half the cast of " The Wire " is British . The fact of the matter is , to get a lot of tougher sell movies like " K-19 " or " Valkyrie " made , you need American star / producer power , and then you make a creative decision on how to use them . Do you go the route of actors ' natural accents because without speaking a foreign language it makes little sense anyway ( Valkyrie , Amadeus ) , does everyone go for it ( K-19 ) or do you mix it up and hope no one cares ( The Hunt for Red October , Alexander , X-Men , Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves ) ? Each has its advantages and drawbacks . And then there are the sillier film conventions which make no sense at all , like how all sword and sandal epics require actors to don British accents a la " Gladiator " and " Prince of Persia . " Ah well .
30515568	337755	Re : Great Actress	I would love to see her onscreen more nowadays . Not as many roles out there for older women , but there are some roles , for example Catherine de Bourgh in the new ' Pride and Prejudice ' which she could completely own .
13244455	337755	Re : Nearly unwatchable .	I agree with your casting comments , and assessment of the mini , although I thought Alice Krige did a marvellous job in ' Children of Dune ' - IMO she steals most of her scenes .
29071432	337755	Re : Great work on Star Trek , Rick Berman was wrong to let him go	It's interesting the observation about the music of ' Enterprise ' being an improvement over the years that preceded the show . I get the sense that Berman finally realized as the ratings dipped into the cellar that he should step back from his original position on the prominence of music . While there was always lush , expensive-sounding orchestration present in DS9 and Voyager , it was rarely memorable and as energetic and percussive as the music on ' Enterprise ' was allowed to become .
26907300	337755	Re : Surprisingly funny	The standard test of a show is to watch the second episode as it is a better indicator of how the rest of the series will be . All I can say is that it is a crime that more people are not watching this series - episode 2 was funny , sexy , well-paced , impeccably acted and possessed just enough heart to end on a good emotional note . This show deserves the post-American Idol timeslot .

117781204	337755	Re : OMG , she's a f-cking retarded .	The only role I think she could have totally handled or improved would be Demi Moore's in " Ghost . " My god can Meg Ryan cry on demand . Maybe she could have handled Clarice Starling , but it's easier to see Ryan taking Foster's role in " Maverick " ( another she turned down ) than that one . She is actually really good in a lot of drama , she just doesn't pick roles that are either widely seen and / or surrounded by good movies . I still hold out hope for a reteaming with Tom Hanks , not necessarily in a romantic comedy though . I actually think she'd have made " The Terminal " much more interesting - Catherine Zeta-Jones played a very Meg Ryan-type character and had little chemistry with Hanks , therefore . . . " The Women " has been a little boost to her career , I'm interested to see what she does with it .

22017106	337755	Re : Corwin's Quest	I did enjoy the bellowing alligator episode if only for how incredibly creepy that nighttime shot of all those alligator eyes drifting in the bog , and the imagery of the morning mists floating amongst the bellowing reptiles all around him .

It's such a promising project , I for one would very much like to see it get made . Perhaps it has a better shot after the Indy film , but Harrison Ford could use the dose of credibility before he embarks on a return to the franchise well . Anyone know where they are on this film's development ?
7312606	337755	Adorable	I feel like a doofus for posting it , but I think Troy's a sweetheart , even when he's being conniving and arrogant on the show . He knows how to play his ' Aw-shucks ' charms .

164808822	337755	Re : This movie is about Rugby ! ! ! !	If the movie was actually about rugby , it would have been better . Instead , it's mostly about Nelson Mandela , and it struggles to make an interesting movie about a character who is too righteous , wise , self-less and moral to be particularly interesting . The true story of the rugby matches is fascinating and this could have been a brilliant sports movie with a scene-stealing turn by Morgan Freeman in a supporting role . Instead , the rugby is tepidly shot and turgidly edited almost as an aside to the Mandela plotline .

109581502	337755	Re : Meg Ryan directing the remake ? ? ?	Hmm ! I'm kinda intrigued . . . She's pretty smart , and this might be the best way for her to work on a good drama - the ones she ends up starring in never turn out well either critically and / or at the box office .
63887594	337755	Re : who will play booth ?	Plus , the next " National Treasure " film's plot deals with John Wilkes Booth . Sure , there's room for two completely different films that involve the character , but it's gotta be annoying to be known as the second movie . . .
4559117	337755	Re : Website	I think it's quite a lovely start - it's already far more fun and comprehensive than the neglected official site ! It'd be a bit of a commitment , but I think a really amazing feature would be an episode by episode soundtrack listing - the CD releases cover only a tiny fraction of all the great music ' Teachers ' showcases . One might be tempted to just write , ' Music by Feeder ' sometimes , but I for one would really love to know all the songs in each episode .
89510269	337755	Re : Great Show	Is this the one I saw part of the other day which traumatized me before I even had time for breakfast ?

Nature is brutal , but man ! If this wasn't that special , then I apologize for the mental image , I swear to you it couldn't be more jaw-dropping than the actual footage .

Also , what are the best options for this mini in terms of US distribution ? I would assume Sci-Fi , for all its faults , remains the best outlet . USA shows sci-fi shows sometimes , but is a sister network . I hope farscape doesn't run into problems when it comes to distribution .
129244151	337755	Re : ' The Silence of the Lambs ' - who dumped who ?	I've always read conflicting stories when it comes to Ryan's almost-casting as Clarice Starling .

Anyone know the real story ?

One could argue the public has a right to know , but doesn't anyone think that the release of the details of the 1994 settlement , whether they are accurate or not , is an unethical thing to do right now , when the judicial process needs to obtain unbiased jurors from the public ? I'm not even sure it was strictly legal for Court TV to publish its findings . . . Seems rather tasteless to me .

24894615	337755	Re : Bad Decision	All the things listed here which are considered debits for ' Prisoner of Azkaban ' IMO are its strengths . Straying from the book - cutting out fun but less relevant subplots , having the characters not always wearing uniforms and thus infuse their characters witrh more hints of personality - wonderful touches . These movies cannot be page-for-page literal adaptations of the books , because as in love with the material as you may be , it will slow the story down . Do we need ' S . P . E . W ' ? Is it absolutely imperative we have the Dursleys this time ? Do you really think everyone wants to sit through either a 3 hour plus film or a couple 2 hour ones ? There's not enough core story to justify either move . IMO the first two films were far too slavish in their adherence to the events of the books , and it slowed down the pacing of both films to often inexorable rates . Film is a different medium , and the end goal is to make a great standalone film , and I won't be surprised at all if ' Goblet of Fire ' is such a film precisely because of judicious editing at the scripting stage .
9796927	337755	The last of Meg Ryan's fantastic haircuts !	If you discount her look in ' Courage Under Fire , ' this was the last film where that famous head of hair was pretty much universally adored and trend-setting . Oh yes , and it was a so-so film which also starred Russell Crowe .
25736506	337755	Re : Venice Film Festival	He doesn't always pick the best projects , does he ? You can't always know how it'll turn out in the end , unfortunately .

' Ally McBeal ' required a wide range of talents , but her limited work outside of the show is really solid as well - I'd like to see her in more projects in the future .
69918606	337755	Such a talented writer !	He got my attention in " Star Trek " by having a hand in some of the best " Voyager " episodes ( " Someone to Watch Over Me , " " Counterpoint , " " Bride of Chaotica ! " et al ) , and also DS9's controversial and wonderful " In The Pale Moonlight , " and I was further delighted by his work on " The Dead Zone ' and " Battlestar Galactica . " I hope he gets to be a showrunner one day - he's got a great knack for storytellnig and dialogue .
25875867	337755	Damn it , I really miss Dan Rather right now !	Never have I wanted one of the big three ' Voices of God ' more than during the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina and then in its aftermath . Dan Rather would have been right there in Louisiana covering one of his favorite topics , hurricanes . He would have lended such gravitas to the reporting of all the terrible events that followed as well , just as he did after the tsunami . And also , if he had the temerity to criticize the official response to the crisis , I doubt anyone would have the balls to try to bully him down this time . It's ironic that now , at a time when it's both appriopriate and safe to take this administration to task , the perennial whipping boy for conservatives is stuck in New York fronting stories for a show that will cease to exist in a few weeks . It's not right , in my opinion .
65777058	337755	Re : My Review ( SPOILER WARNING )	What an excellent synopsis ! I must say that I personally did not care for this outing . Taken simply as a piece of television drama , I found it to be quite lacking in terms of plotting , direction and characterization . The plot and character expositions / clues are shoehorned into dialogue in a distinctly hamfisted manner . A boring character waltzes into the scene , says something blunt and clueish and then saunters off hoping it seemed unforced and natural . Add in the Scooby-Doo culprit reveal and one had might as well be playing a loud game of Clue for all the subtlety that this script throws around . The various characters are completely faceless and wooden caricatures of people . Only Lady Tressillian , Treves and Marple make any real impression , and that is mostly due to the distinctive portrayals by the respective actors involved . Miss Marple's involvement in the story is once again all too cursory , which begs one to question the wisdom of adapting non-Marple stories this way in the first place . There are a great number of untapped short stories that are begging to be commited to film , and it seems a great waste to put these polished production values and Geraldine McEwan's modern take on the titular character through the ringer like this .
62732230	337755	Re : How much is her salary now ? ? ?	I would disagree that she isn't considered to be a versatile actress . She received the obligatory praise for her energy and athleticism for ' Tomorrow Never Dies , ' ' Supercop ' and ' Crouching Tiger . . . ' but starting with the latter film she started to get serious acclaim for her acting . I haven't read any review of ' Memoirs of a Geisha ' which criticized her performance . Today , she has more English language films pending release than any of her well-known peers , and to my knowledge the roles were cast with her acting skills , not her martial arts abilities , in mind .
12265621	337755	I have no idea if this film is any good . . .	. . . but I know I'm never going to find out because it seems that every other website I go to has a sound and / or video enhanced ad banner for the movie which scares the crap out of me 30 seconds into my web browsing . Between this and cable networks like FX bombarding me with noisy self-promotion - during - a program ( who knew that the scalpels used on Nip / Tuck could swish so loudly ) , or MTV trying to force young people to vote Emergency Broadcast System-style by badgering them right in the middle of a show ( we wouldn't want to take out some of the 20 minute-per-half-hour commercial time for that , would we ? ) and I'm fed up with the trends in marketing these days . Okay , so that was a big tangent I shouldn't hold against this movie . But in any case , I don't think it looks terribly interesting , certainly not tasteful , so I'm happy to give it a miss on its own merits .
69783262	337755	Re : surprisingly a jerk	Seriously ?
3258731	337755	Great work on Star Trek , Rick Berman was wrong to let him go	Anyone who loved the exciting and memorable scores and themes of Star Trek : The Next Generation through to its fourth season may also agree with me that Trek's music , while still beautiful and lush , lacks the memorable nature of the music Jones composed such as the Romulan themes in season 3 or the Borg theme in ' The Best of Both Worlds . ' Rick Berman has stated he prefers music to stay in the background , which no doubt frustrates the composers who have worked on Trek series and films under his watch , and Jones himself has been vocal about his displeasure . It is a shame to see a talent like his not getting the exposure it deserves .

158624811	337755	Re : Harrison Ford . . . . ego problem ?	I doubt it was an edict from Ford - he's very private , but I can't imagine him being a diva , especially onset - he's too workmanlike . The scene you are describing sounds like a typical one - extras looking the star in the eye would be distracting and not make sense . In the St . Patrick's Day parade , you can see a lot of real parade-goers gawking at Ford and the camera . ; ) A lot of time people surrounding or looking out for a star or the overall production will lay down stricter rules than are necessary . I was recently related a story by a photographer who worked with Michael jackson . His minders insisted no one speak directly to Jackson and should give him a wide berth . When Jackson arrived on set , he was apparently despondent that no one was talking to him .
72841311	337755	Re : Has this guy ever been in a good movie ?	Yeah , " Kate & Leopold " isn't bad at all . It's certainly Meg Ryan's last decent film to date . Meyer steals his scenes - it's a nice role for him .

23855412	337755	Re : Hetty is coming to VHS + DVD	The days of British TV seasons being more than 13 episodes , let alone 6 are long gone . There's just not enough money to go around . On the plus side , one could argue that the overally quality is less diluted without any filler episodes that aren't so creative when the writers ' backs are against the wall filling in a 22-30 episode quota . That's always been HBO's philosophy anyway .
25682765	337755	Re : Venice Film Festival	There was some laughter at the film's end and climax , something Calista Flockhart was understandably peeved about .
11974731	337755	Re : He's not high , he just has a sense of humour . . . . . .	Flockhart is hilarious in this film , IMO . She plays a foul-mouthed borderline psychotic with most of the funniest lines . Come to think of it , all the women have the best parts . An uneven film though , too sporadically funny to be truly enjoyable .
30515913	337755	Re : The person who could save this show ? Oprah !	Well , having gullible moms buy the kids ' books Oprah tells them to would be a good start , but I just think that the cost of fudning a small handful of ' Reading Rainbow ' episodes is a pittance for her and a cause she'd get behind .
7336538	337755	August 30 and 31	On the Hallmark Channel .
18248555	337755	The person who could save this show ? Oprah !	It makes sense . She's displayed a great love of literature and of children's causes , so why not lend her support to ' Reading Rainbow ' and encourage children to read in the way her book club worked for contemporary authors ?
13179424	337755	Re : why did they cancel it ?	The ratings were solid but unspectacular towards the end . The show went through a lot - ' ER ' competition , constant cast changes , timeslot changes ( the final one a movie from its successful Monday night slot to a more competitive Wednesday ) , creative ups and downs ( many thought it jumped the shark by the time Austin wanted to become an astronaut , and David E Kelley even pulled the same trick he did on ' The Practice ' - he fired a slot of actors in one fell swoop to reinvigorate the show in its last year ) . Still , it did get a lot of awards attention and though ' ER ' will always over shadow it , I'd say it did okay for awhile .
24776659	337755	Re : It - is - interesting . . .	I'm sure the workload was enormous . Filming was stretched for long days over many months , far more material was shot in that time than in any motion picture or TV movie or mini he's done . The chance to do something for a family audience was probably very enticing ( I doubt a lot of little kids are out there seeing his dark turns in ' Elizabeth ' or ' 28 Days Later ' ) , as was the chance to work with Davies again on something fun . But it's still a job , and he probably was told by eager execs that one year with an open-ended option to do more was fine . A fear of typecasting may have been in the mix , but they backed off that explanation very fast , so I'm not so sure about that . I suspect he was just happy to do something different for a little while and then move on to something else that wouldn't have such a punishing schedule .
65867368	337755	Re : My Review ( SPOILER WARNING )	It's really peculiar how many of these Marples have sidelined the titular character in order to let someone far less interesting hog the screen . This time it's Mallard , while earlier we had rather unmemorable characterizations of Tommy & Tuppence and Jerry Burton doing all the work . While this helps make Miss Marple's fleeting appearances all the more memorable , it does not turn the overall dramatization into anything terribly involving . I wonder if this is a conscious effort to spare Geraldine McEwan any extra duress . She seems very spry , but if that were indeed the case , I would question the wisdom of the whole endeavor in the first place ! ' Nemesis ' does indeed look interesting . Unfortunately , I will be without CBC after next week , so I'll have to wait until ' Mystery ! ' runs it in the US . I look forward to your thoughts on it though . : )

Compare this to the almost non-existent criticism of ' The Hunt For Red October's ' Sean Connery for being a Scottish Soviet ( his accent is already foreign so that makes it okay ? ) or the idea of Russell Crowe having a British accent for ' Gladiator ' even though he's constantly referred to as ' Spaniard ' ( just because a slew of British actors were amongst the first to play ancient Greeks and Romans on film doesn't mean it makes any sense for them all to talk like Laurence Olivier ! ) or Charlton Heston sounding like Charlton Heston in ' Ben Hur . ' So Ford and Neeson aren't going to win the Meryl Streep award for best accents - it's still notable that they tried , and the criticism of that attempt , if not the execution , is hypocritical .
129273621	337755	Re : Meg Has Aged . . . And is she NICE ? ?	I don't think he's ever said that . The last thing I read he said was that they're always sending each other scripts that might be good for a re-teaming , though he's a little worried he looks much older now . Or something like that . I definitely believe she's not as sweet or down to earth as some of her rom-com characters , but she's notably altruistic and caring , even if it often has that Hollywood veneer you can never be too sure about . Having perfected the cutesy quirky nice persona really painted her in a corner - if she was that nice people would find ways to be annoyed with her eventually for representing that type of character 24 / 7 , if she's not that nice then she might as well be a b * * * * . Whatever , I still like her acting , and I think we should be appreciating any actress who is so skilled at comedy . She just needs better script choices - two direct to DVD movies within 6 months , and " The Women " was sadly a wash in terms of a comeback party .
83933972	337755	Re : i don't like karen	I think the film needed a character who wasn't so accomplished when it came to being cruel and calculating . Margo and Eve and DeWitt are so overpoweringly manipulative , to have Karen be the same could easily rob the film of an effective conduit for audience sympathy . I find it difficult not to feel for Karen - her self-doubt and shame as her own clumsy plan falls to pieces is evident on Celeste Holm's face , and it's very effective . The voiceovers also manage to paint her as intelligent and full of perspective as she looks back in hindsight . It's interesting to sidenote that when Holm played Ado Annie in " Oklahoma , " she portrayed the character as someone who's really just trying to be - nice - to everyone . She can't say no not only because she's something of a sexpot , but also because she doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings . That's a fascinating angle to play , and no other actress to my knowledge went that route with the character afterwards . In any case , I think " All About Eve " needed a character who wasn't creepy or snide or diva-ish to provide some color . Karen certainly displays a backbone in some scenes , but I thought hers was a refreshing bit of froth in what is a quite dark film .
10657982	337755	It - is - interesting . . .	. . . to consider how well the actors who played the Doctor in this spoof would fare in a regular series . Certainly , Rowan Atkinson and Richard E . Grant are still candidates for the role in the future , and I wouldn't count out Jim Broadbent or even Joanna Lumley either ( especially considering how fun she was ) . Atkinson has always enjoyed the program , and with some tweaking , and perhaps a bit more levity would be a high profile and entertaining Doctor . Richard E . Grant I'm still not sold on , even with ' Scream of the Shalka . ' Anyway , something to consider if the new series does well and Christopher Eccleston doesn't stay in the role as long as the series lasts .

71496813	337755	Re : Order of the Phoenix	I haven't heard too much of his work , but he's very versatile from what I have heard myself . " State of Play " is extremely modern and memorable - it has orchestral moments , but some of it is electronically enhanced and very percussive and fast-paced . I have great confidence that the man can heighten any action and chase sequences immeasurably . " My Family and Other Animals " has a very quirky slightly jazzy score . " Prime Suspect's " music was mellow and unobtrustive - never felt out of place .
4287919	337755	The most promising Trek actor-turned director since Jonathan Frakes . . .	It's a close race with Roxann Dawson , IMO , but I think McNeill's body of work is quite excellent . It may have come down to luck of the draw for good scripts , but he has directed three of the most highly acclaimed episodes of Trek in the last few years ( ' Voyager's ' ' Someone to Watch Over Me ' and ' Enterprise's ' ' Cold Front ' and ' Twilight . ' ) He seems quite adept at showcasing developing relationships between characters without being overbearing or obvious , and he handles action packed episodes with style and great energy . I woulod love to see what he could do with a feature film one of these days . . .
70426319	337755	Trailer at Showtime On-Demand	The episodes of " The Tudors " being previewed by Showtime now have a trailer for this show , so it's clearly well out of pre-production .

26907167	337755	Re : Why Tony ? WHY ! ? ? !	The thing is , ' Stacked ' and ' The War at Home ' aside , Fox is something of a haven for comedy at the moment . The animated sitcoms , ' Arrested Development , ' ' Malcolm in the Middle ' and now ' Kitchen Confidential ' are all intelligent , very funny and reliable comedies the likes of which are harder to find on the other networks .
24057689	337755	Re : Colin Farrell	The only blame I put on Colin Farrell for ' Alexander ' comes from his inability to outweigh the terrible quality of the script with his desire to work with a legendary ( past his prime or no ) director . Stone just can't make a great film anymore - Farrell acts the hell out of his part , but there's no real character , and a hodgepodge of a story - not a befitting portrayal of one of the greatest true stories in history .
18207205	337755	Re : What ? No discussion ?	From an HBO press release : THE GIRL IN THE CAFE ( HBO , New ! ) - Bill Nighy , Kelly Macdonald , Ken Scott , Anton Lesser and Corin Redgrave are set to star in a new HBO original movie about a hard-working but timid civil servant ( Nighy ) and his life-changing relationship with a mysterious girl ( Macdonald ) he meets in a café . David Yates ( " Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix " ) is set to direct the project , which is expected to bow this summer on the cable channel , from a script by Richard Curtis ( " Love Actually " ) with Curtis , Paul Abbott ( " State of Play " ) and BBC's Julie Gardner executive producing . Production began this week in London on " Girl " with Tightrope Pictures producing in assocation with HBO Films and BBC1 . I believe shooting took place in February and is finished . Apparently Nighy's character takes this girl from the cafe to the G8 conference he is attending , and this leads to many complications . Curtis wanted to raise awareness about the many issues plaguing Third World nations . http www cp org english online full Variety 041213 1121306AU html Not sure exactly when this film is airing , nor if it is more of a drama or a comedy ( most likely the former with some comedy sprinkled in ) . I am looking forward to it immensely .

69766492	337755	Re : New play based on his work	I saw the next day myself , and was so impressed . The amount of loving care that went into delving through Gray's journals and monologues . . . and then piecing them together to form a coherent structure is so evident . And it is very touching and powerful the way it is presented . No matter what age the viewer is , there will be a character representation that speaks to him or her . Absolutely wonderful , and I love the device of having guest actors play the career aspect - it adds an extra surprise and treat to the experience . Really a wonderful , moving play !

17466851	337755	Re : McCoy's Sendout	Hey , I liked him well enough , and I've seen all the wingeing about his exit , but we're lucky he got one in the first place . Had the TVM started out fresh like ' Rose , ' we'd be without it to this day . As for it being sickly appropriate for this incarnation . . . there was so little real character drama in seasons 25 and 26 - he was always right , he was always manipulating everyone , never deceived and I never got the sense that anything could get away from him . To see him run into a random situation like that ? The irony is interesting , at the very least . Sure , he wasn't my favorite Doctor by a long shot , and I like seeing characters go out on a heroic note , but I would happily let this unique senseless death stand as it is . Colin Baker's not having a proper exit is far more offensive .

17059873	337755	Re : ' Worst ' series	I've only been a casual viewer - there's a little part of me that occassionally likes this kind of fluff ( the same part that watched ' Ballykissangel ' ) but I have to agree that the Katrina exit was such a waste . And Lexie was portrayed as something of a jealous sleaze if I remember rightly , trying to seduce Archie while he was still with or pining for Katrina . Sure , Lex was enobled afterwards , but I never thought they were a proper match after that .
134055685	337755	Sylvia Plath	I just read this rumor that she's planning to play her in an upcoming biopic . . . Is this bogus ? There is a passing resemblance , I'll give it that at least . . .
24738232	337755	Re : It - is - interesting . . .	The decision to leave was his own , but frankly , the BBC was at fault for giving him the option to leave after only one season . If you have a franchise series with longterm prospects , even if it flops you still would have locked in your lead actor for a more longterm contract - actors with such agreements still can bow out ( with more hassle ) , but it has to be a mutual decision with their employers . It's Christopher Eccleston , not Hugh Grant - why he only was signed for one year is beyond me .
63485470	337755	Re : Worst movie ever ! ! !	I said I don't hate it ! I saw it in theaters , I bought it on tape . Of course no one should talk it up as if it's the best film any of the cast or crew has ever done , ( although come to think of it , Ivan Reitman has been in quite a rut ever since . . . ) , but I was saying I don't think it deserves a reputation as a terrible movie . I do still hate the David Schwimmer parts to this day , but it's a decent little film , and a fun Harrison Ford role .
62783548	337755	Re : Status ?	It's possible Ford's role in the film might be limited too . As has been pointed out , in the book Conger's first appearance is well into the second half of the book . Even if the role is expanded , it will probably still amount to a supporting role and require less time on set . Anyways , it would be nice for Ford to have one more shot at a non-Indy hit . It's sad to see him starring in so many dodgy projects .

Great fun .
147863416	337755	Re : Which movie killed Meg's career ?	Are you kidding me ? " When a Man Loves a Woman " is textbook Lifetime / CBS Sunday movie material , but Ryan acts the hell out of that part , garnered a Golden Globe nomination for it and burnished her image as a versatile actress . Furthermore , it came out in _ 1994 _ right in the middle of her zenith as a movie star . She still had " French Kiss , " " Courage Under Fire , " City of Angels " and " You've Got Mail " coming . Ryan's career downturn came as a result of both the media circus surrounding her fling with Russell Crowe and a string of poor movie choices ( " Kate & Leopold " was the closest thing she's had to a hit in the last decade . " Hanging Up , " " Against the Ropes , " " In the Cut " and her last 4 movies were flops , even her much-fought for " The Women , " sadly ) . Instead of going so dark in her attempt to find Oscar pedigree with " in the Cut , " she would have been better off had she really pushed for something less salacious like " Cold Mountain " or " Far From Heaven " or " Sideways . " Regardless of whether than was ever a possibility and that hindsight is 20 / 20 , she would have done well in those films . Heck , even reteaming with Tom Hanks for " The Terminal " would have been a better move career-wise . She still consistently gets favorable reviews , but they are now of the " what is Meg Ryan doing in this crap ? " ilk , which is a shame .
82946310	337755	Re : people want Owen to die ! ! !	Yeah , Owen was tolerable when the writers weren't trying to make him sympathetic .

74028062	337755	Re : He is to Terminator what Joel Schumacher is to Batman	I wouldn't go that far at all . IMO Jonathan Mostow made the most of an average script , handled the action ably , got good performances out of Schwarzenegger and Stahl and was generally unobtrusive enough to not polarize audiences the way Schumacher did .

17059789	337755	Re : Its terrible	One good thing about season 6 - it's nice to see Tom Baker back in style , although I've always liked his performances just ever so slightly more reigned in . I do think season 7 should indeed be the end - a chance to bring back some of the regulars for one-off appearances and wrap the show up properly .

133028407	337755	Re : Bad Acting ?	I think Martha was at her best in " Human Nature / The Family of Blood . " Just the right combination of sass , longing , fire , desperation and guile . As much as I liked Billie Piper , Rose was too prone to cry her way through scenes - it got a bit much . I do think Freema was ill-served by the unrequited love storyline , and both series 4 of DW and series 2 of Torchwood struggled to give her anything truly interesting to do - she too often was stuck on her own without anyone to play off of , but I do hope she is back for a special or two - she would be the ideal candidate to oversee a regeneration for the audience and carry over into the first episode of series 5 IMO .

10754771	337755	Re : cast changes	Does anyone know why it is that so many of the supporting characters in the series had an ever changing revolving door of actors portraying them ? IIRC , there were 4 Aunt Dahlia's ( I much preferred the first - she was the most sympathetic ) , 2 Aunt Agatha's , and there are few of all all those prospective female fiancés who haven't been recast at least once . Was it the change of directors from season to season ? Actor unavailability ? Other creative differences ? It can get a bit confusing at times .
141709329	337755	Re : why did she do the Mummy part 3 ?	I'd say it was a few factors . Probably the chance to star , briefly or no , with Jet Li again had a lot to do with it . No doubt it paid better than the straight dramatic roles she'd been doing lately , while also publicizing China as a rewarding place to shoot films . Also , she clearly still enjoys doing action roles ( as her next two pending films indicates ) , and this was perhaps her way of soothing the alleged hurt of not being in the new Indiana Jones film as had been rumored for years .
28613245	337755	Re : will it be on Dvd ?	I for one would love to get a copy of the series somehow . Not seeing it in the HDNET lineup anymore . I remember the pilot and first few episodes as being really quite good .

16603216	337755	Re : Greatest childrens show ever	It is possible to find some of the stories presented in ' Long Ago and Far Away . ' ' Abel's Island ' is available on VHS , as are ' The Fool of the World and the Slying Ship , ' ' The Emperor's New Clothes , ' ' The Wind in the Willows , ' ( and the TV series spawned from it ) ' The Man Who Planted Trees , ' ' Uncle Elephant , ' ' Frog and Toad Together ' and ' Frog and Toad Are Friends ' ( DVD as well on this one ) . ' Rarg ' is on VHS in Europe , and a few other episodes are probably available , but many of the rest are much harder to find - ' Svatohor ' for instance . Putting these episodes out on DVD would be a great boon to the artists involved in these mostly little-seen stories , but it would need some rights-wrangling and a good slew of promotion ( not impossible if PBS could give it another brief run and advertised the bigger stars involved in the various installments ) .
61809702	337755	Re : The Divine Ms . Keith on DVD ?	There are so many great performances by Penelope Keith I for one would love to see on DVD . Unfortunately , British TV series and telefilms are very sporadically released to DVD in any Region format , even if they get exported to America . Even something recent like ' Margery and Gladys ' may take ages to see the light of day . This is why I keep the VCR around .
16602865	337755	Re : Greatest childrens show ever	Indeed you are not . I still have a tape of some of the episodes ( the first tape I had broke , unfortunately , and it had some episodes I may never be able to recover ) and I remain amazed at the quality of the productions that were acquired for this series . They may be obscure , but these are some truly well-made and entertaining stories , testaments to the effectiveness of many short films ( not to mention the injustice of the fact that there aren't enough forums for them ! ) , which is what many of these episodes were first shown as . The animated stories in particular stayed with me . ' The Pied Piper of Hamelin ' remains IMO one of the greatest adaptations of that story , and ' Abel's Island , ' ' The Reluctant Dragon , ' the Hungarian Folktales , ' Svatohor , ' ' The Wind in the Willows , ' and ' The Man Who Planted Trees ' are equally superb . Here is a link to the National Endowment for the Humanities ' website which details every episode of ' Long Ago And Far Away , ' including the casts , directors , producers , awards . . . a great resource , though it does not list them all in the exact order in which they were aired . http www neh gov projects medialog child html

I first saw her in ' House of Cards , ' but was too young to remember . I then sought out ' Ultraviolet ' a few years ago and I was a bit put off by her character , although it was something of a departure for her ( which I did not know at the time ) . Then this past year I've watched ' Heat of the Sun ' on the recommendation of my mother ( really unique , lush and interesting ) and ' Chancer ' once it was on DVD , and I was surprised to see Harker in both , and far more bubbly and easygoing as well . Now I've just rented the BBC's ' Pride and Prejudice , ' and lo and behold . . . ; ) The Frances Urquart triology is back on my list as well now that I'll be able to appreciate it .

85384894	337755	Re : If you could recast Carrie . . .	" Notting Hill " to me just puts MacDowell in perspective . Julia Roberts is glamorous , natural and sexy in a way that easily could have been similar in 1994 . Meg Ryan I always champion because she has underrated versatility . In 1994 she had " Sleepless in Seattle " under her belt and " When A Man Loves A Woman " in release . Also , physically she had long hair at the time which was IMO very flattering . I was surprised how she pulled off an edgier kind of sensuality in " Addicted to Love , " ( it's a wonder what a little eyeliner and leather can help an actress do ) . Still , while I reimagine that performance and I see her having great chemistry with Grant , it is definitely hard to picture a performance angle from her that's less of a wallflower and more of a seductress .
50640857	337755	Sarah Jane Investigates	CBBC is developing a Russell T Davies-penned pilot special featuring Sarah Jane Smith , tentatively titled , ' Sarah Jane Investigates ! ' If it performs well , it would of course be picked up for a series committment . No word on K-9 , but I expect this series will be more akin to ' Inspector Morse ' than ' K-9 and Company , ' i . e . little to no sci-fi fantasy and no robot dog costing a small fortune in royalty fees . Bit of a continuity issue there when one considers ' School Reunion , ' although if the series were shown to take place before that episode then K-9 being out of the picture makes sense . Have to say , I'm excited about the prospect - such a lovely character and underexposed actress !

It's such a shame that all the tabloids with nothing better to write about latched onto the notion she had anorexia and planted something tawdry where people were formerly praising her acting on ' Ally McBeal ' and her charm . I don't think the occassional comparisions to Audrey Hepburn's coquettishness are out of place at all , though her acting is mannered in a different way . But now all people talk about is her name in connection to a bad skinny joke simile or Harrison Ford . I would love to see her in a quality mainstream comedy or romantic comedy , though I don't find her dramatic skills to be in doubt either . I don't think this film is going to be a big hit , no matter its quality , so I await that comeback movie .

10197188	337755	No ' Mission : Impossible 3 '	According to The Hollywood Reporter , Carnahan has exited as director due to creative differences . One has to admire his convictions , who knows if his beef was with the studio or with Cruise , but on paper this is the second high-profile follow-up to " Narc " which has fallen through for him . It's very possible that Harrison Ford's tinkering and steadfast nature caused " A Walk Among the Tombstones " to collapse , but there seem to be lots of A-list actors gagging to work with him because of that movie and it's just not happening for whatever reasons .

3432525	337755	Amazing .	Amazing that yet another American version of a British show is inferior to its source material . I'll give it another few weeks , but I fully expect we can add ' Coupling ' to the list of shows that includes : ' Amanda's ' and ' Payne ' ( ' Fawlty Towers ' ) ' Cosby ' ( ' One Foot In The Grave , ' initially ) ' Men Behaving Badly ' ' As If ' ' What Not To Wear ' ' Trading Spaces ' ( ' Changing Rooms ' ) ' Big Brother ' ' Queer As Folk ' . . . IMO all shows which failed to replicate the charm and appeal of their British counterparts and almost all fly in the face of rare successes like ' Three's Company ' and ' Who Wants to Be A Millionaire ' as evidence that much humiliation would be saved if American companies would just stop trying . And the worst thing is that the really terrible american versions sour the chances of others even sampling the British originals . But if anyone did happen to switch to BBC America after NBC's ' Coupling ' to see the original , what a shock they must have had .

11929749	337755	Re : Worst movie ever ! ! !	One huge star . I don't know - I don't hate this movie . It's not ' The African Queen ' for the 90s as it obviously was trying to be , but it has some genuinely funny moments , none of which involved David Schwimmer's subplot . Harrison Ford is an underrated comic actor , Anne Heche is harmless , the plot is breezy , and hell , I don't even hate the damned pirates . Now , ' Hollywood Homicide , ' - that's - a bad Harrison Ford comedy .

69146184	13333255	Re : Spa / Retreat leader opinions on him	I think he was supposed to be a kind of false prophet for the patients , and the audience was meant to see him as this . His affirmations sound almost religious and cult-like , and I found the scene where they're all sitting around in group therapy very telling . He asks each of the patients to explain why they became sick ( with the onus being that they * made * themselves ill , through their own faults ) and he manages to upset each one . The woman who it is suggested was abused seems to glare at him , and Nell in particular seems to realise how false the whole set-up is and is noticably curt and dismissive of him , before the scene finally cuts to the character Lester tottering around in the background . I think this was purposely to show that the Wrenwood Centre did not work , and could in fact be harmful to the patients .
61567197	13333255	Sometimes credited as . . .	He seems a nice guy , but I don't think it's a good idea to be credited as Michael Oliver Ponce , which imdb says he is - just stick to your normal name !
107717498	13333255	Re : Just watched this film . . .

I can still picture the husband's blank face watching the television even months after watching it for the first , and probably only , time .
109557584	13333255	Song	It's a bit obscure but does anyone know the song which plays briefly when the lead character goes to the strip bar / peep show booth and walks past the two girls dueling with the light sabres ?

Is it as good as it looks , or have I just been taken in by the trailer ? Speaking of which , anyone know the music in the trailer ? It's sort-of in the middle , about 1 : 15 seconds , and is kind of a 1940s sounding Hollywood tune ? Cheers-ears
105025734	13333255	Re : NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL	The concept was original , but the film was absolutely dire - I can't believe I wasted three hours on this rubbish - it even makes ' The Dish ' look good . The acting was poor at best , especially that irritating Cockney ( " Pour the beer - the doc says suspense is bad for the old ticker ! " ) . I hung on until the end to finally see The Langoliers themselves and they looked like some kind of human stool with teeth drawn with Microsoft Paint ! I mean , I know it was 1995 , but I'm sure the effects could have been better ! A good story sadly marred by a cheap made-for-TV looking production .
61046584	13333255	Re : Is it * that * bad . . . ?	Thanks NuWav - I might brave giving it a go once I can find it then . I'm no prude , but I didn't want to waste the effort on something which turned out to be nothing but some bloody gore-fest , but it sounds as though it's well directed . Finally managed to get hold of a copy of Spoorloos the other day , wondering if it's ' shocking ending ' was as bad as everyone said , and got to say I was a little disappointed - surprised ( a bit ) maybe , but not that horrified .
67736474	13333255	Re : Lack of Climax ?	There's an excellent analyis of the film on a Wikipedia link - basically , the director is critical of both Carol's lifestyle , the medical and psychiatrist profession that can't cure her , and the New-Age philosophy that can't cure her either . It's all a bit long-winded , but the crux seems to be : it's her life , her role in society ( of lack of one ) , which is making her ill . The illness gives her a purpose , so she revels in it , but ultimately everyone fails to cure her - and she'll always be ill - until she looks at the wider problem .
133071928	13333255	Re : Ending / Point . . . . ? * spoilers *	Ah - didn't spot that gaping flaw . Don't get me wrong - enjoyed the movie for what it was , but it seemed unrealistic in parts , especially towards the end . Would have preferred it just being tense like the atmosphere at the beginning ( a bit like The Vanishing - the original , not the dodgy Sandra Bullock remake ! ) but seemed to go a bit downhill from the eyeball / allen key scene . Loved Silence of the Lambs in that respect as you knew * why * he was doing it - made it more scary and realistic I think Look at those cavemen go . . .

Any ideas ? Look at those cavemen go . . .
67736238	13333255	Re : Question about the mysterious ' staggering ' man	He * could * be a symbol of where Carol will end up , but I think Nell's husband ( who died in the igloo ) is possibly another future for her . The man is just " afraid of everything " - what he eats , the air , the outdoors etc . - I don't think he has any specific illness , but is just an extreme example of the others at the camp .

I was tempted to try this one too but just wondered how disturbing it really is ? How would you rate it ? I've enjoyed other typically depressing foreign films before , like Requiem for a Dream , Dancer in the Dark , Lilya-4-Ever etc . , but if this is genuinely that bad , then I'm not sure I want to go through the hassle of finding it , ordering it and waiting for it to arrive - only to turn it off before it gets to the end ! I assume they commit suicide at the finale - is it particularly horrific then ? Any worse than other films ?
69145817	13333255	Er . . . I don't get it - ? ! ?	I've enjoyed some of Moodysson's other films , and like to think that I can appreciate movies which don't cater to a typical , stylised format , but I really can't grasp the point or principles of the film ? Is it supposed to be a comment about pornography , or lust , vice etc . ? Or am I reading too much into it ? I got the impression that the characters were gradually degenerating and - especially Tess - degrading themselves further and further as the film progressed , but I could be wrong . How did anyone else interpret it ? Any suggestions as to what it is supposed to be about ?
107168150	13333255	Re : The Greatest Show on Earth * possible spoilers *	Oh spoil it for me Eer ; ) At best , I am a spoilt child who hates surprises . I assume you've seen it then ?

67737430	13333255	Re : ' Safe ' as an AIDS movie	I was starting to suspect it was an AIDS-related illness myself , but there's an excellent analysis on the Wikipedia page , down at the bottom by the links section . Basically , it suggests it's Carol's life ( or lack of ! ) and role in society as a person ( or again , complete lack of ) which is making her ill . Whether the Environmental Illness is real or not , or whether she has it or not , is irrelevant - medicine has failed her , psychiatry has failed her , and the New-Age retreat will fail her because she needs to look at herself and the society around her before she'll become better . None of them offer her a solution because the problem is her pointless , shallow , emotionless and meaningless existence . The Director himself said that he mentioned AIDS in the film because , at the time , there was a field of thought which claimed AIDS patients were making themselves ill , through anger and lack of self-love . He was critical of this as well , but I don't think the entire film is AIDS-related . After reading that link , it really does make more sense - although you've got to kind-of forget about the illness part of the film and look at the wider picture .
60966524	13333255	Re : explanation	Hey - At least you've done something most people always dream of and never get the chance to do , so who cares what anyone else thinks ? If you're grounded enough to post on here , then you can't be all that bad I'm sure - just ignore them and hang in there

147853236	3762955	Re : Major flaw ( spolier warning )	princess _ pam _ b . . . I'm sorry to hear you've had problems like you've explained and thank you for your post . It got me thinking from the perspective of someone who is on drugs , not ever having done [ or needed for that matter . . crazy enough ! LOL ] them myself . Acting rationally is not a thought that they'd be processing . We too are currently having this exact problem with neighbors and it does beg the question , when do you call the police and when do you say it's not worth the drama ? ! Well , it seems hardly anyone has called the police for this exact reason . . . fear of repercussions . However , I look at it a little differently . I'm tired of the minorities of the world ruining all things good for the majority of us who do do the right thing . If everyone surrounding these people , all phoned the authorities , then they would have a hard time ' ganging up ' on everyone as a collective . This is their tactic , they work on intimidating us into silence . We have lived around people like this many times over the years and done exactly this , hidden in our shells . Now however , I've started making a stand as our family and all the other good , decent ones around us , deserve the right to not live in fear and enjoy their home , street , park , surroundings etc . like anyone , anywhere ! We are going through hell right now but I will not back down as they're slowly realizing this , they are weakening . It's not easy that's for sure but raising children to see that if you're a big , bad bully that can get away with anything because people are too scared to get you into trouble , what is that saying ? ?

162268397	3762955	Re : Anyone else saddened when they killed Sgt . Wilhelm ?	Except there shouldn't be any risks when you go out for a beer , which is why his death was pointless and rather unfair . His death may have seemed pointless to you if that's the context in which you want to put it but unfortunately it's not the reality of the situation . Perception was he was having a beer at the bar . Reality was he was having a beer at the bar in the middle of a war ! ! Did he take his gun and uniform off before he went to have his beer ? No ! If the roles were reversed , would he have shot first ? Who knows but the likely answer would be yes . Why ? Because it was WAR ! Unless you have been in one yourself as many are experiencing now and many before them , you cannot even begin to predict the actions that would take place . It's much more now that a ' Should he , shouldn't he ? ' It is what is was and he was shot and as nice as he was , a young man with a young family , I cannot and do not doubt for a minute that given the roles reversed , or had he had another soldier there that fired first , he would not have hesitated in firing also . As in ' Saving Private Ryan , ' you find than humanity you arrived with and when a man begs for his life and swears on his children that if you let him go he will be forever grateful , only to come across this same fellow on a new day where promises may be remembered but not kept . Does one wait to find out if it's kill or be killed ? Of course not . Why ? Because War is an entity unto itself , a hell no-one knows how they will react to until heaven forbid they are in that exact situation . Do I believe it is right that he was shot ? No . Did I feel for him ? Yes . But would you risk your life by turning your back and trusting he kept his word not to shoot you ? I'm sorry but I don't believe any of us can answer that unless placed in that exact situation and I wish that upon no-one . This is the cold , harsh reality of war ; shocking and impossible to understand . It's also a debate that will go on until the end of time as we continually refuse to learn from past and present and thus repeat these despicable acts of violence and cruelty against our fellow man . When this particular thread debate fizzles out , it will start again with the next movie that raises the same or similar subject matter . We can talk and talk and talk about it until the end of time but talking will not change anything .

Reading the subtitles added to the pace , excitement and was the complete experience in this genre . I read up to 7 books a week and many of these could and should be considered for the big screen . New , fresh and not stolen , hacked , glamorized and ruined . I'd love to know the total cost of budget for the Swedish version compared to what the Hollywood one will end up costing us .

It's a must-see regardless of whether you like swimming or not . The cast is fantastic . There are two movies titled ' Swimming Upstream , ' one Australian starring Geoffrey Rush and the other an American movie written / directed by Robert Emery and starring Matt Czuchry . Another brilliant one is ' On A Clear Day ' starring Peter Mullan and the always watch-worthy , Brenda Bleythn .

I have to disagree with the OP and agree with the other responses , there are many , many babies born that sadly are not adopted , regardless of disabilities or not . I think if you were to look at the accurate ( by that I mean exactly that , not what we're told ) , you'll find you're wrong , unfortunately . And no , I'm not talking about Orphanages or Foster Care as I know of these very well . Since you posted your comment , have you re-watched this movie and not thought about the fact that he should / would've been adopted and just actually taken in the story for what it is ? Even if we could happily say ( which we can't ) , that most babies are adopted out , there are little ' Evan / August's ' everywhere so try to think of them when you watch this movie . Because believe me , they are out there ! It's children who are placed in orphanages at older ages that are often passed over . I just couldn't accept that this kid remained in an orphanage since infancy . I am sorry , but I can't help but find your last two comments rather ignorant . I think you need to face reality and perhaps look up some comprehensive and valid statistics ! To say you couldn't accept he was there since infancy , boy oh boy , you really should visit the library and read as many memoirs as I have on this subject ; then you'll realize your perception really isn't the reality . I wish it were , but it's unjustly , not . * And although this happens , accept the movie and the plot for what it is and enjoy it for that , nothing more , nothing less .

163162373	3762955	Re : We're studying this in media , I need to know	. . . ' Cilleka ' I'm so tired of " animal-lovers " boo-hooing about animals " dying " in movies . It's fake , get over it . Anyone who would make a scene in school about a fake animal death obviously needs to get over wanting to be the center of attention all the time . I don't actually understand the reasoning behind your comment . I don't think there is a single adult who truly believes ANY animal is harmed or killed in the making of a movie , especially not in this day and age . If they do though , explain to me where's the harm in caring ? ? I'm sorry but , in my opinion , to say someone just wants to be the center of attention is quite arrogant of you . The reason I find myself upset more and more over animals being hurt , be it in movies ( I know aren't real ) or in real life , is because I have compassion , empathy and feelings . Without getting too deep , we , as humans , are not above animals . People hurt and kill other people every single day , often for no reason . Have you ever known an animal to deliberately kill a person , by that I mean knowingly ? Of course not , because they can't . When they kill it's instinct or an act of self-defense . They're innocent creatures . This is why SO many people care about what happens to animals and find themselves , as I do , crying over a scene that you know logically , hasn't really happened . Clearly you seem to not have yet made this connection and don't understand . We cry at the end of a sad movie even though we know the actress / actor hasn't died ! ! We cry when a baby is born even though it's totally fake and the kid is a twin and already 6 months old ! ! We cry laughing at some absurd comedic scene that we know would never take place in the real world ! ! What's the difference and where's the harm ? ?

Admittedly there were aspects that could have been improved upon but you must remember this was a low-budget movie with relatively unknown actors . I felt they tried to squeeze quite a lot into this particular film rather than concentrate on repeating what we usually see with this subject . Although I didn't have the same intense connection with the 3 girls that I have done in previous movies , between them , their situation and treatment had me in tears and a 2-hour long discussion following it . I think any director would be happy with that outcome . That said , we all see thing differently and perhaps you simply found ' Trade ' a better movie for you . At the end of the day the message is the same I think , making money off others being humiliated against their will is wrong and needs to be stopped .

I think your opening comment is a bit harsh considering we are just discussing the film as ' we ' see it . However , such responses is exactly what the film was inspired to elicit from people / audience and Haneke would be proud to see the diversity in conversation still 10 years after the movie was released . The rewind scene with Fatty and the shotgun , had me reeled in , hook , line , sinker and my remote still attached to my hand ! ! I've watched thousands of movies and very rarely do I found myself being caught out in the way I was with this scene . Part of me would have liked a little of this earlier on but on the other hand , I think doing it where he did got the best all-round affect from the audience . That is of course if people were taken aback by it like I was .

98600906	3762955	An Unforgettable Experience . . . Must See !	' Tattoo , A Love Story , ' a little known movie found in a little known DVD store . I don't read the back of a dvd covers as I don't want it to prejudice me in any way . The way I choose movies is simple , if I haven't seen it I grab it . For some reason I've always neglected to borrow this one . It's one of those movies where 10 mins into it I'm immediately chastising myself for not grabbing it all those times I glanced at it but then moved on ! Two extremly unorthodox people , seemingly complete opposites of one another come together to share some memorable life experiences . I didn't like tattoos for many decades until one day I looked beyond the stigma that follows them and instead saw the talent , art and stories behind them . I love how this movie was as realistic to life as you'd get and did not shy away from some of our lesser qualities as humans . This movie showed that people need to more accepting if not of what a person does or who they are , but of learning about these aspects before they judge . It's fine to not like something but try to learn about it so you then have basis for that opinion . Be with someone for who they are not what they are . You'll be the one with them , not your family and friends and I think this movie really highlighted this extremely well . There has always been a certain stigma against people with tattoos as there is with many other things in life . By spending time with Virgil , Sara became a stronger more confident young lady regardless of whether the two would have stayed together or not . Drama , romance , humor , dignity , honesty , spirit , pain , sorrow , warmth , understanding , laughter , acceptance , it had it all ! Brilliant work from these actors and non-actors who had me feeling as if I was eavesdropping on a real-life family drama . The chemistry between Megan and Virgil was very convincing , I just wanted to put my arms around him and whisper it'll be OK . I noticed he hasn't done anything since which is disappointing , he has a natural talent and I'd love to see him do more movies .

158125348	3762955	Re : Anyone else saddened when they killed Sgt . Wilhelm ?	' nmeisher ' . . . Thank you and you're welcome . I've read the thread and would like to say it's refreshing you were able to have in-depth , even heated discussion but a mature one that didn't turn personal ! I believe we all have the right to our opinions and voicing them doesn't mean we are attacking someone for theirs . IMDb is a discussion board and for once it was nice to see it being used for the manner in which it was intended . I wouldn't have expected either of you to be banned especially given yours was in the truest form of a ' Discussion . ' A heated discussion is still none-the-less a discussion is it not ? Many people for one example ' A-Movie-Buff ' go from thread to thread purely to insult and belittle people while others are affronted by your opinion and take it as a personal attack . I do believe there are times when we can have a discussion and in the end , agree to disagree . It proves that we CAN be given the space to get into it providing it stays on track and doesn't turn into one belittling another just for their opinions . - " Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties .

105176869	3762955	Re : Ridiculously pretentious	I have to disagree although I respect your opinion of this movie . I think the movie contained many different aspects of life to some of us and for that I found it inspiring . The town was never the same after he returned for many different reasons and after watching this movie last night , I can only say that some of us just don't see things the same way . Perhaps this is because we all have different lives and will never see the same because of it . If you get something out of this movie , it's to help as much as you can when people are suffering from domestic violence and that is never helps to keep something form people , always be upfront and tell them , even if they may not like what you're saying . Honesty is the best policy . I also loved that it was game enough to show the world that religion has many faults and no-one , no matter who you are , is far from perfect . There should be more films highlighting this fact . Religion is extremely damaging to our society . - Two things are infinite : the universe and human stupidity ; and I'm not sure about the the universe -
98602374	3762955	Re : Too similar to Before Sunset	I get what you're saying about ' Sunset / Sunrise . ' I think we were possibly quite spoilt with these two movies and are therefore perhaps finding small flaws that would originally have gone unnoticed . It does have similarities but I enjoyed Goldberg's off-beat nature and thought this gelled well with Delpy's Marion . I agree , it had more humor and didn't take itself as seriously but I'm guessing that may have been intended . Not only was Julie Delpy writer / director / co-producer / editor AND did the music for the movie , she also had her father working behind the scenes and her mother , actress Marie Pillet which playing Marion's mother . As a result , this delightful family experience had me emotionally invested from the get-go . On par with ' Sunset / Sunrise ' but did lack that little ' something ' that both those movies share . - People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character . -
158065005	3762955	Re : Anyone else saddened when they killed Sgt . Wilhelm ?	As a human being and parent I did feel that perhaps he should have been saved from death . . . HOWEVER , being a parent with a child and son-in-law fighting to defend their country I'd say no . I think in times of war there is no time for thinking rationally , it's a kill or be killed mentality and that's something we are all born with an instinct to survive . Plus in war , you let someone go , as we have seen in the likes of ' Saving Private Ryan ' and in many documentaries , these moments of emotional rationalization can come back at you ten-fold . This is a film and I took it as such . Death in times of war happen whether you are a new father , mother , husband , wife etc . War is a miserable thing that causes and creates more pain , heartache , confusion and conflict than anything else . - " Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties . " - Erich Fromm

I am about to start watching ' La Vie En Rose ' as we speak for the first time and what a night to choose to watch it hey ? What a truly tough category it was this year , my lord . I had to feel for Julie Christie as I watched her in ' Away From Me ' and I gotta say , she showed exactly why she's the professional she is . I think I'd have been really quite happy for the Academy this year to just go , sorry it's too close and we've decided instead to give them all an Oscar each ! ! ! LOL What a great concept . It was one of the best Oscars in recent times with regard to trying to choose a winner but honestly not really having a clue who'd take it out on the night . I must say , I take my hat off to Cate Blanchett who pretty much caused me to miss Marion's expression as her name was called due to the fact that Cate all but leapt off the chair with the biggest grin on her face . Occasionally losers show little to no expression and tonight I think they all looked genuinely happy for Marion , a very popular winner in a group of legends of all ages ! It's also great to come online today and see people genuinely happy for the winners and their posts reflecting same .

98604356	3762955	Re : The queen of self-righteouness	The implications in this movie are not Julie Delpy's but a characters . I believe we can learn a lot from many things in movies if handled effectively and maturely . I watched the movie twice , the first time from Marion's point of view and the second from Jack's . Due to him not speaking the language while she speaks both it's possibly easy for some people to be getting the wrong understanding and it's coming off as one-sided . I think this barrier causes some viewers to find certain aspects of the movie misrepresented when in-fact we're just not getting the point Delpy's aiming for . I wouldn't say she's crazy , perhaps just unconventional . - People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character . -

101789552	3762955	Re : Are you kidding me ? ? ?	I actually thoroughly enjoyed this movie although I do agree some of the acting left a little to be desired . The highlight for me was Saskia Burmeister who played ' Vanya . ' I do agree I don't quite get why people don't go to the police but hell it's life and sometimes we don't feel they're going to be of much help to us . I certainly felt for Veronica Sywak's character ' Ashley ' and her position . When you get caught up in something as emotional as this situation you don't always think clearly . When you have a mother begging you to help most people with a heart would find it hard not to do what they can . Regardless of the script or the acting or anything else , I think the message was clear . Human sex trafficking is happening under your nose regardless of what country you live in and it is absolutely unacceptable . To think ' Crystal ' went from one prison to another is extremely upsetting , she was just a piece of meat thrown in with the majority already there . Governments need to take notice of these situations and act on them . It is abhorrent knowing young women while being in custody in a detention center . As if they've not been subjected to enough already . Perhaps legalizing some places may help I don't know but that way at least the girls would be treated with some dignity and disgusting people like the ' Mr & Mrs Glassman's ' of the world wouldn't be living in comfort off the vile acts of the perverts that frequent their establishment !

Re : Dating Marketa Irglova by zacharhebius ( Fri Mar 14 2008 10 : 02 : 27 ) UPDATED Sat Mar 15 2008 04 : 11 : 01 I realize it's over a year since you posted this but I am an such a fan of these two and their movie ' Once ' and I wanted to thank you for your posts . I personally don't think they or anyone who knows them needs to justify their private life to people who quite frankly don't have any right to question or judge another persons life or decisions , morally or ethically . I have a very large fansite for an actress that I run myself and I made a moral decision on starting it that there would at no time be any personal and / or tabloid information and pictures posted ! I respect peoples right to privacy and once consenting adults it is none of anyone's business what they choose to do . I'm of the opinion , if they're happy [ and adults ] , that's all that matters . There's enough doom and gloom in the world without people getting their knickers in such a knot over age . I have a daughter who is the same age as Marketa and she is dating a lovely man 10 years older . She is so much more mature than boys her own age and I've raised her with morals , values , respect [ for herself and then others ] and to follow equal parts heart and head . I have raised her well and trust her judgment and if it doesn't work , it goes down to life experience . But at this present time I am happy they are happy and life is too short to be worrying about anything else . Celebrities fall into two categories - the ones that go all out to be photographed at every possible opportunity ( tabloid junkies ) and those who are photographed doing and for their job . In my opinion , if you choose to make your personal life public , some have done so to help promote their career / movie etc . , then they've opened their life up to the world . On the other hand , others who are only photographed privately by Paparazzi scum , deserve to be left alone and by that I mean in all aspects ! Thanks again , I wish them all the best and look forward to hopefully seeing either of them , together or separately , back on the screen or music studio . - " The More Opinions You Have , the Less You See .

105199396	3762955	Re : Did you hate the couple and their kids . . .	Maybe they worked really hard for what they have . This is not explained in the film and I couldn't NOT feel for them , although broken leg or not , I'd be walking if they'd taken both my legs off ! ! Monty Python comes to mind ! I think however , when people like these enter your house as unexpectedly as these two did , you really don't quite know how to react or what to do . Maybe there was a misunderstanding you're thinking . Let's face it , most people don't assume someone is a killer and whack them with a golf club ! You try to be reasonable and polite at the same time . These guys were going to have their way from the get-go , it was meticulous and as they clearly had no conscience what-so-ever , it was easy for them to have control over the family , it didn't have to be physical control . Emotional / mental control is an extremely powerful weapon , especially when you are trying to calculate what to do in your head to try and keep your family alive . I think most humans assume they can ' buy ' time and either wear the intruders down or simply the longer they're there , they can try to make a plan to get out . It's a movie you could talk about the ins and outs until the cows come home I think , which all in all , is exactly what we're supposed to get from any film so I give praise to the filmmaker for this as this is exactly what he has achieved here . I am a huge fan of Ulrich Mühe , but found I could not take my eyes off of the character ' Anna ' played exceptionally realistically by Susanne Lothar . I don't think any of us could really say how and / or what we'd do in this situation and hope none of us ever have to find out . I truly felt for them , what do you do ? You don't believe they're going to kill you all , let's face it , how many times does that sort of thing happen to these sorts of people ? They go up for a nice holiday and this happens ? ? How prepared can you be ? ? Instinct kicks in and what we'd do is anyone's guess , as much as we might like to say we'd do different , I don't think we'd know unless we were faced with the same circumstances . What disappointed me slightly , was the lack of back-story with the characters of Paul and Peter . Why were they like this ? Why had they decided to target this particular area ? Why then at that time ? I would have thought with so many up for their holiday it would have been a slightly risky time to do what they obviously had planned . Had they done this before ? You know , the kinds of little things that drive people who absolutely love every detail of a movie , completely nuts ! lol All-in-all , I enjoyed the movie , not one of the best I've seen but definitely not one of the worst either , by far .

I IMMEDIATELY went and cuddled my sleeping children and whispered to them that I would ALWAYS be there for them no matter what . I could not imagine any child that goes through this . Who'd have believed this was Georgia Groome's movie debut ? ? That kid had my gut churning and anyone who couldn't see the film or the performances for what they were , given the subject matter , don't deserve to be seeing it at all ! I know we are all entitled to our own opinions and I DO respect that . However , I get extremely annoyed when people have an expectation and blow the movie / actors out of the water for not meeting it . See the movie for what it is , you don't have to like it but respect the blood , sweat , tears , time , effort , budget and performances that have gone into it . Please ! That's all I ask . - Two things are infinite : the universe and human stupidity ; and Im not sure about the the universe -

112657711	3762955	Re : Reasonable sentence ?	I completely agree with you . Although I've always been someone who says regardless of what the law is / says , we all know what it is and should abide by it , I think commonsense must prevail at times like this . I fail to see how it helps ' Randy , ' his family and / or the community by locking him away for 25 years and putting in him a cell with a convicted murderer . Sure , he committed 3 crimes , 2 drug related and one of vandalizing a mans car , but for gods sake , look at them for what they are ? Plus , if they continue to follow down this path , us the tax payers may as well just hand our checks over at the end of every pay week as we will be needing thousands of prisons to house these people . At present their solution to this exact situation is to parole convicted pedophiles , rapists etc . to make room for the 3-strikers ! Be it not a extremely serious matter , I'd find this lack of moral , ethical and commonsense conduct utterly comedic . It would be rather interesting to know exactly how many children / relatvies of Politicians , Judges and other so-called ' high-ranking members of society ' are doing 25 years after striking out ! ! But what is the solution ? ? Food for thought , just what this film is . - Two things are infinite : the universe and human stupidity ; and Im not sure about the the universe -
162918771	3762955	Re : I don't like this guy . . .	' serkankocak ' . . . And I still hold that he is one of the worst actors of all time and still comes to me like he is retarded ! For one , I really dislike people who state ' worst of all time ' . . . ' worst actor / actress / director / movie , ' blahdy blahdy blah ! ! If you claim something as ' the worst , ' what are you rating it against ? ? And if so , when you see something that is worse still , where do you go from there ? ? I'd say you're very limited in everything you watch and do if that's the best you can say and with no substance or reasoning behind it , just ' worst ' and ' retarded ! ' I think only people with limited minds and opinions make these statements . There are plenty of actors / directors / movies I dislike but when I know how much effort goes into putting a movie together , who am I to judge . Also , actors are usually just doing a job , hence they're ' directed ' to do and say certain things and sometimes it's due to a poor script , poor director , lighting etc . , but they do their best . So you've studied acting in 3 countries , are fluent in 4 languages and have starred in 59 movies ? ? NO would be my guess because it's always people can ; do and people who can't ; criticize !

105200842	3762955	Re : We're studying this in media , I need to know	It's quite strange if like me , you watch a movie and are more upset when an animal is hurt or dies than you are a human . I watched the Swedish movie ' As it is in Heaven ' last night and I was trying to tell myself it's a stunt bunny , it's okay ! It doesn't work though and as in this film , I almost felt more for the dog than I did the people . I guess it's a good quality to have . As plenty have said already , you don't see the dog being hurt , you just hear a yelp and then no more barking .

155958675	3762955	Re : thanks for the spoilers	If you are dumb enough to read through a discussion board about a movie , before seeing it . . . . . . . . . . then you deserve to have the movie spoiled for you . Get real ! Who the hell do you think you are stating that discussion boards are ONLY for people who have SEEN the movie ? ? Discussion boards are for EVERYONE ! ! All the poster of this thread is saying is if , IF you post a spoiler , PLEASE state it in the ' Subject ' section ! Plenty of people come to the boards to see if a movie has been given a good / bad rating and / or what people thought of it . I have been visiting this amazing site for a VERY long time and only rarely has anyone ' spoiled ' a movie that hadn't already been brought to our attention in the subject box ! So for the majority , most people recognize that while you CAN have a discussion about a movie , you don't always have to give details away and IF you do , you act according to the rules of the board and state the fact . Get off your high-horse and don't for one second assume these boards are ONLY for the likes of you and people like you , you're sorely mistaken ! Abide by said rules and everyone can enjoy movies as they and this board were intended ! . . . Oh and I love this persons signature . . .

155959440	3762955	Re : Ridiculously pretentious	By ' onona ' . . . People have grown so used to the shallow , soulless , overly contrived crap shoveled out by Hollywood that they see a simple , human story like this , and don't understand it . So they use " big " words like " pretentious " in an effort to prove the film was stupid , when in fact , it simply went straight over their heads . Could not , did not , put it as well as you just did . Well said ! My husband and I discuss and agree on this issue over many movies . People SO expect to see blockbusters , which I'll admit I love as much as the next person . However , there is no real HUMAN heroism in them anymore than there is real HUMAN tragedy . Much of what Hollywood churns out is simple fodder purely for entertainment purposed and you gotta love ' em for that . Yet when this is all we see all the time , we become disconnected with the real world , good and bad shown to us in a simple but powerful medium . I read a lot of non-fiction and watch a lot of Independent and Foreign movies to off-set the over-the-top movies I usually see at the cinema . People say I live life , I don't need to pay to see it ! I disagree . ( Most of us watch / read the News don't we ? ) I find what I read and see are NOT my life and therefore I am learning of what others have done , do and plan to do in this big world of ours and it often inspires me to better myself or more-so , appreciate how good I have it compared to many . Stick your head in the sand if it so suits you but life is passing you by while you're down there . When you come up for air and see a movie like this that many can relate to , understand and / or wish to experience , don't just ( for want of a better word ) , diss it because it's a human interest story . I guess I see it that someone , somewhere has lived this story and if you didn't like it that's fine but don't grab the Thesaurus only to throw big non-constructive criticism at the movie . Why not ask someone who DID like it , why they liked it and ' discuss ' it and perhaps we'll all learn something new ! ! One big Hollywood blockbuster movie had the quote " Without disappointment you can't appreciate victory . " Perhaps you may not like this one but you WILL take something away from it that may help you better understand something else . Radical concept for most I know but it's worth a shot don't you think ?

155958319	3762955	Re : Did anyone like this movie ?	Thanks ' ThunderGore ' if that was aimed at my comment ! I don't know why the ratings show what they do sometimes . It annoys me when I see ' Worst Movie Ever ' or ' Worst Movie of All-Time ' but no reasoning behind it . I don't like quite a number of movies but none I'd give one-star as I look deeper into them . If they entertain me , even badly , I get that someone , somewhere , had a vision that in all likelihood looked good on paper and for one of a million reasons , didn't work out . If there is ONE things I've learned , it's NOT to judge ANY movie by the ratings given on IMDb . That said I sometimes use them as a base if I have a number of movies to watch in a row but a rating will NEVER sway me to not watch a movie anymore than it'll sway me to like one I think was all hype ! I watched ' A Film with Me in It ' again last night with my hubby and WOW , what a movie ! I don't often love movies I've watched over and over but with this one , I can't help but crack up every time I watch it and will continue to . 1 ) " Jain from Dublin " said . . . " . . . tedious to watch " & " A Film With Me In It is rubbish . " and 2 ) " dbborroughs from Glen Cove , New YorkSo " said . . . " bad and unfunny I stopped caring . . . " " This film stars Dylan Moran and someone who's name and face I will try to block from memory " So there ya go ! What do we learn from this ?

104909513	3762955	Re : I'm freaked out that . . .	I call him " Ted " because that was his name . Don't know if that helps clear this up , but it seems obvious enough to me . I also , sometimes , refer to him as " Bundy , " being that was also his name . Perhaps it's disconcerting to some that I refer to people by their names , but to me , it just seems natural . As for knowing so much about him , what's wrong with that ? Oh wait . . . you're not one of those " It's sick to study serial killers " people , are you ? You know , if it was sick to study serial killers , and no one took the time to do it , there are scores of serial killers who never would have been caught . They were caught because someone took the time to study other serial killers and develop a system of profiling based on their newly-found insights . Really , the less you know about serial killers , the easier prey you are . If you want to ignore this stuff , go right ahead . But ignorance can be a pretty dangerous thing in a world where people like Ted Bundy still exist . I have to agree with you on both counts . I notice I call him Bundy more than anything but either way it IS his name , although that said there are many things I could and would like to call him . I actually read a LOT of books on subjects most people think are quite shocking and assume that must make me some kind of ' odd ' person . In-fact I'm probably the most ' normal ' person you can get . I find these topics fascinating as they're , to state an obvious point , true and happen every single day of the year everywhere in the world . I think this fact scares people as they don't want to admit it's happening in their street / suburb and us who are interested in this are just ' freaks ' or ' like ' serial killers . I read about them to be a better parent and help raise my children in as safe an environment as I can and so far it's worked well . To others who saw my library borrowing list or my book-shelves , they'd be mortified , but as I said , what I'm learning helps make me a better person and parent and I see absolutely NOTHING wrong with that . You cannot deal with something you know nothing about , this is why we teach children about the ' Birds and the Bees ' from an early age ! Does this mean those people are ' sick ? ' Grow up and stop looking at the world through rose-tinted glasses . Pick up a newspaper or watch the news and you'll realize the world is not always a nice place . Information is knowledge . . .

I'm not asking anyone else to boycott it , I'm just stating that with a movie where such a high standard has been set , you just cannot top it , especially a foreign movie .

161048290	3762955	Re : hold on	' Vocalities ' . . . So you guessed part of the ending , so what ? I'll never understand why people feel the need to internally guess what'll happen next and then whine about being right . It really doesn't take away from the film at all . Then again , I don't try to guess the endings to anything . I just watch it and see how it unfolds . Some people who watch a LOT of movies DON'T have to guess the ending as such , it just follows a natural course in our minds . My partner is always amazed that I ' had it ' but it's not for want of trying or sitting there trying to be the one smart ass who ' gets it ' it's purely because I watch a hell of a lot of movies . My partner is a reader and the same can be said for books . If you read one particular genre , say mystery all the time or have read hundreds , it comes natural to have your mind guided toward the end result . The only time I whine about this is when you get so many rom / com type movies that just have the happy ending one after the other after the other . Now you can't say you've sat down to one of them and NOT known exactly that the guy / girl will win the other by he end ? ? ! ! Be truthful now ! !

156973960	3762955	Re : funny and sad at the same time	Couldn't agree more with your list of other movies to watch . Have seen all of them and thoroughly enjoyed each and every one . I was so pleased to hear they did not allow the Hollywood lot to take over this film , it would seriously not have been worth making if that had been the case . It is the extraordinary film it is because of its circumstances and of the special group of people who both financed and / or worked on it . The only movie I can think that comes close to this made in the US is ' Leaving Las Vegas ' a Mike Figgis film starring Nicolas Cage . However , that too was a movie thrown into a pool of problems but eventually made on a shoe-string budget . I think something has to be said about Hollywood and their big-budget movies ; in these two movies , less was much , much more ! ! ! ' freq77 ' . . . if you have not seen ' Leaving Las Vegas , ' I would highly recommend it . I have a first-edition copy of John O'Brien's book which is the basis for the movie . Nicolas Cage won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance , one of the best I have ever seen . Sadly Elisabeth Shue missed out but her Oscar worthy performance is truly extraordinary . There is not as much humor in this as in ' Dangerous Parking ' but in my opinion , if it doesn't move you in any way , I doubt much would .

158182976	3762955	Re : funny and sad at the same time	' freq77 ' . . . You are more than welcome , always like it myself when someone reminds me or tells me of a good movie and ' Leaving Las Vegas ' is one of my most treasured . It's just one I own that I feel the urge to watch every now and again to remind me what's important in life . I have to say we have similar taste as I have also seen , own and LOVE the ' Pusher ' trilogy . Now they are also in a league of their own . I have no problem with subtitled films as I find they are always more engaging in that they don't hold back ( Pusher trilogy perfect example ) and are more than happy to push those boundaries a little . I felt ' In Bruges ' did that also and was why I enjoy it so much , along with as you rightly stated , the interplay between humor and the gritty moments . These kinds of movies test and push my way of thinking in so many ways and for these reasons I find them wonderfully entertaining in all aspects . A question : Have you seen the Danish movies , ' The Green Butchers , ' ' Adam's Apples ' & ' Shake It ? ' These are all on the humorous side but hilarious if you like that kind of comedy .

88804458	3762955	Re : thanks for the spoilers	I totally agree . I too , like right now , have a pile of movies that I've hired from the dvd store to watch . I like to come home , put each title into iMDB and look up the rating and reviews . I dislike people who have watched the movie already and don't consider us who haven't . However , I do appreciate people who give us a heads up as to whether their review contains spoilers and I refrain myself from reading those . I think WAY TOO many movie critics give away too much these days , as do the trailers . Some trailers are now in excess of 3 minutes long which doesn't sound a lot in the sense of time , but as most movie-goers know , they put the best parts in to attract us . I watched a movie , ' Sorry , Haters ' not long ago and wanted to watch it again this time with my husband . However , while watching another movie he saw the trailer to ' S , H ' and it pretty much gave it all away . Admittedly , some movies are only worth the 3 minutes their trailer allows , but please , let us be the judge of that and leave something for us to figure out along the journey . Reviews are great as they give me so many perspectives from other people's view of that movie , but just keep in mind that some of us want to read your reviews before watching the movie so don't give too much away . Thanks and regardless , it's great to see so many people enjoying movies ! ; - )
104910302	3762955	Re : Major flaw ( spolier warning )	Some of you need to stop over analyzing films to its utmost minutiae . I do understand what the OP is saying , but there are tons of movies where Ive yelled at the screen or my TV for the people to call the cops . But you have to realize , that if they did call the cops and the cops came , the movie is over . So when it comes to movies and TV shows , you have to suspend reality just a little bit for entertainments sake . And by the way , its not a MAJOR flaw as the OP says it is . In fact , its such a miniscule flaw that its inconsequential to the overall movie . I'd have to totally agree with you on this . I also understand as some things are quite frustrating and I had this exact point out in reference to another movie recently . That said , this is a discussion board and I do like to discuss certain points with others to get their view / opinion on things . I think that's what makes a good message board and I find I can learn a lot and see movies in a different view when i've discussed certain aspects with others . My partner has been known to have to calm me down however when I'm all but on top of the T . V . offering my phone to them to call ' The Fuzz !

158069117	3762955	Re : One of the worst time wasters ever	I did find it rather boring , having trouble staying focused for the first two-thirds of the movie . I stuck with it and it did pick up a little pace in the final third but not enough for my liking . I will admit I was hoping the ending had more depth ; however I felt let down and disappointed that I was left with the slightly bitter taste of infidelity and lies . Then again , perhaps this was what I was meant to feel and possibly how the characters themselves felt on reflection of their actions . It certainly doesn't rate in my top 20 French films , nor in my bottom 20 and DO NOT agree that it's " One of the worst time wasters ever " not even close . - " Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties .

152577579	3762955	Re : One Of The Worst Movies !	by - typher . . . I think it is crap lol within 30mins I had turned the movie off . - low budget ! ! I'm sorry but if you turn a movie off after only 30 minutes , how can you possibly judge it in any way , shape or form ? ? And because it's ' low budget ! ! ' Come on ! ! ! Million dollar movies haven't been around forever , they all began somewhere and from people who have the balls to try something a little different . Sure beats the crap they repeatedly churn out of Hollywood year after year after year . Budget is purely a number by which to work within . It's what they do with it , how they do it etc . I honestly felt , although definitely not Oscar worthy , they definitely succeeded at entertaining myself at least and for that I can only congratulate them . With big budget studios , stars demanding enormous amounts of money and CGI to take over what an actor is actually paid to do in the first place , the pressure to perform is enormous for all upcoming actors , directors etc . And to be honest , if you thought it was such crap that you turned it off after 30 minutes , why did you waste more of your time posting here ? ? It just makes no sense to me . You could watch a Football , Soccer , Tennis , Rugby , Motor Race etc . etc . for 3 / 4 of it and think how bloody boring but all that could change at any moment and that last 1 / 4 make up for the rest . If you don't have the decency to watch the movie in its entirety , then have the decency not to post an opinion based on nothing . Would like to see a sequel , following them out of the country in 2 hours ! ! ! Hope it's in the pipeline ! PS - As posted in another thread , flaws and all , I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and for that exact reason . I'm getting tired of seeing movies that are so over polished and leave nothing to us as an audience . - " Without Disappointment you can't appreciate victory " - ' Memphis - Gone in 60 Seconds ' -
98603695	3762955	Re : Feminist hate politics	I think you have taken what was said out of context . Indeed the story does make certain implications , some subtle some not so subtle . However if at the end of the movie you take those implications with the essence with which she is referring and trying to get across , I don't believe it's even close to what you say is " One-side hate propaganda . " I don't see this movie in any way , shape or form being hate propoganda . Also , if you have an opinion and you wish to post it on a discussion board ( which should need no clarification ) , then try to do so in a mature manner .

112658626	3762955	Re : His shirt . ' Spoiler '	I know most of us would say while watching this that we wouldn't put up with this and that , but in actual fact , given the circumstances , we'd probably do exactly what Randy did . I think he realized that even though he wanted to kill ' Jake , ' he understood that there would be another ' Jake ' to take his place . |A horrible predicament that way too many are having to suffer through and many of whom will be traumatized and damaged beyond repair when / if they are released . Do you agree with me that a kid like ' Randy , ' doing time for the crimes he committed and was subsequently convicted for , be placed in a cell with a man who murdered his wife and has no remorse over , still justifying his actions to anyone who asks ? The text below is what I typed in another thread and thought I'd put it in this one to see if anyone agrees with me on it . Although I've always been someone who says regardless of what the law is / says , we all know what it is and should abide by it , I think commonsense must prevail at times like this . I fail to see how it helps ' Randy , ' his family and / or the community by locking him away for 25 years and putting in him a cell with a convicted murderer . Sure , he committed 3 crimes , 2 drug related and one of vandalizing a mans car , but for gods sake , look at them for what they are ? Plus , if they continue to follow down this path , us the tax payers may as well just hand our checks over at the end of every pay week as we will be needing thousands of prisons to house these people . At present their solution to this exact situation is to parole convicted pedophiles , rapists etc . to make room for the 3-strikers ! Be it not a extremely serious matter , I'd find this lack of moral , ethical and commonsense conduct utterly comedic . It would be rather interesting to know exactly how many children / relatives of Politicians , Judges and other so-called ' high-ranking members of society ' are doing 25 years after striking out ! !

I don't get why on earth it would seem perfectly okay until you realised the age difference and now , in your words , it's a " little weird . ' Has it changed your perspective of them or the movie and if so , who are you to have the right to judge their relationship ? Do you know them ? Like I said on another thread . . . For goodness sakes , get over it ! ! There are enough horrendous things in the world happening each and every day , honestly , if they are fine with it and her parents are fine with it , then who are you to judge them or even have the gaul to come online and question it ? There are nowhere near enough happy relationships out there so if they're happy and they're not hurting anyone , good on them ! Yes , it does change the perspective of the movie in that you realise they had a strong connection from the start , but just perhaps , as crazy as this may sound to certain people , they wanted to keep something that is obviously extremely private , just that , private ! ! Maybe they also didn't want the dynamics of the movie to change for the viewer and I can see many are ' creeped ' out by it , why , only they know . Also , maybe they weren't that intimate during the making of the movie , perhaps that friendship turned into something more during filming . The music was very intimate and meaningful and perhaps , as happens with love , it just worked it's magic . Quite frankly , it's none of our business , we are here to judge the film on its own merits and as far as I'm concerned , their personal life is exactly that . . . personal ! Fantastic film , I would be extremely disappointed for anyone to be turned away from viewing this based on some immature comments regarding their private life .

162266119	3762955	Re : The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo now listed . . .	Oh dear , or dear , will they never learn . Maybe they just can't read the subtitles . I totally agree , I don't think Hollywood will ever learn to just leave well enough alone when it comes to great foreign cinema . I cannot think of a single one they have remade , and I use that term loosely , that has even come close to satisfying me and thinking well , good attempt . My family watches movies of all genres and language and we also read a heck of a lot of books . On a regular basis we continue to read so much that I would consider excellent fodder for filmmakers . However , instead of looking at these fresh , endearing and original stories that are screaming to be ' heard ' and brought to the big screen , they plunder away flogging a perfectly good horse . A good horse I might add that ends up dead and buried by the time they've finished with it . I remember my initial reluctance to watch subtitled movies years ago when I younger and I understand it's a little different . Now having purchased and hunted down hundreds of Foreign films from all countries far and wide , I feel excited each time a new one arrives . For me , foreign movies are not about subtitles anymore , they are about educating me and my family , learning about different cultures and feeling like we have traveled places just from watching them . I feel the same toward Independent films and it equally annoys me when the powers that be choose for us which films are to be shown at our local cinema . To watch foreign or Indie we are left with the choice , or lack thereof , to travel long distances , wait to see if they're released on dvd and then if anywhere near you etc . I apologize for getting off-track here but the worst thing that can be done is for them to be remade . It's a little like chinese whispers , by the time Hollywood has translated it , interpreted it and manipulated it into what they deem it to be , it's nothing compared to the original . Or in the case of ' L'appartement , ' ' Open your Eyes , ' ' The Vanishing , ' ' The Eye , ' ' Under Suspicion , ' just to name a five . They lack the essence of the original language and so much more it's beyond frustrating . It something ain't broke , don't fix it . . . or in Hollywood's case , if it's already been made and made well , step away from the movie ! !

You can neither objectively discuss , respect other people's opinion or their right to have one in a mature manner . How anyone would , or for that matter could , have a discussion with you about any movie is beyond me .

Narrow-minded post from a narrow-minded person . Get the movie on DVD , which does have english subtitles and then review it . . . if you must ! I'm fed-up with people in the 21st century , still whining about subtitled or heavy accented films . If you don't like subtitled movies , don't hire / buy them and if you do , don't complain . Maybe , just maybe , you might actually learn something . Even our children watch them as they respect that the world is made up of all sorts of people , cultures , languages etc and it's in their best interest to learn and not expect everything to be changed just to make life easier for them ! - " Minds are like parachutes - they only function when open .

157110892	3762955	Re : In the subtitles , the old man at farm say that Alex is his grandson , but	This was possibly a mistake , it's hard to tell . However , I found the subtitles in this movie by ' KIMI LUM ' to be the worst I have ever come across . We already sadly , miss out on a lot through translation . Given the amount of foreign cinema now enjoyed throughout the world , it's time for them to get their act together and have a native speaking English translator for subtitles . These seemed as if they were translated by a 5 year-old , given the budget of these movies , is it too hard to ask for correct subtitles , or as close as can be interpreted ? ! - " Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties .

Does it remind anyone else of Mike Figgis's film ' Leaving Las Vegas ' starring Nicolas Cage ? ? Both films were refused finance by big studios and for me , two movies all the better for it ! Although Peter Howitt didn't plan on playing ' Noah ' but I seriously cannot imagine anyone else pulling it off with such integrity for the character . I don't believe in coincidences and although the movie has had a very rocky road , it has all been for the best possible outcome . To Direct , Write , Produce on top of starring as lead , take a bow ! On top of that , after watching all the special features , I thank each and every person who had any involvement on this film and / or who helped out financially , you take a bow also .

163096980	3762955	Re : Will Boycott Remake ! !	Yep , sh ! t does happen , often , and it will when they remake this . I have faith in David Fincher and am a fan of his but it's the studios that will ruin this movie , not the director . Then , will he continue on with the rest of the Trilogy ? The only way this film will come remotely close to the Swedish version is if ( and it's a big IF ) , they cast unknowns , especially the two leads , ' Lisbeth Salander ' ( Noomi Rapace ) and ' Mikael Blomkvist ' ( Michael Nyqvist ) . Though there are many amazing actresses out there , if you've seen this version , you'd have to admit it will be hard to find someone as dark , damaged and intriguing as Noomi's ' Lisbeth ' . We know so much about celebs today that this is one role that begs to be played by an unknown as much for the character as for the audience . In my opinion Carey Mulligan can't compete and Brad Pitt as ' Mikael Blomkvist ' ? ? Oh , come on ! ! Brad's acting isn't in question here , we know he and Fincher worked exceptionally well together , but again , behind the character of ' Mikael ' lies a deep , intriguing past that we are yet to fully understand . How do you get that when stars the quality of Pitt & Co . are such open books ? As far as the remake goes , there are so many amazing stories for studios and directors to put their own mark on , why steal the work of someone else ? It wouldn't happen in print ! Is it purely because it's so bloody difficult for some of you to read subtitles ? ? This is a movie where the subtitles work in favor of the experience . At the end of the day , with so much other material out there , some of us just don't understand why in hell they want to continue pumping out remakes of movies that should never see the light of day again , let alone mess with something that doesn't need messing with ! ! Is there NO originality left in Hollywood ? Is it just too hard for Production Companies to find something new and refreshing ? Instead its hey , we'll just ' take ' their material , quality material they've worked hard to achieve , so we can plod along , stick our stamp on it and recycle it . . . . OR . . . is it just because there are people who really can't be bothered to read the subtitles ? ? You have no idea what you're missing ! Hell , Hollywood has made only a handful of half-decent sequels they started ! ! If Fincher can hold his ground against the studios , the bullying tactics , big names for big bucks at the expense of a quality movie , then I'll be the first to applaud . Then there's the screenwriting adaptation , production , editing . . . I won't be holding my breath ! !

I don't think you can compare those two movies anymore than you can compare any two movies and for many different reasons . Ten people will see the same movie and interpret it ten different ways . A good movie should provoke thought and discussion but I don't think you can compare this to Fight Club and say that was good and this one , ' Choke ' was bad . They are different and unique in their own right . The process changes so much from its initial concept . It begins as an idea that slowly takes shape on paper , progressing to a short story , novel etc . From the Author it's passed over to the Screenwriters then to the Director .

21412677	3594855	Re : I don't get it . . .	Also remember that this film was done 32 years ago ! It was a blockbuster in its day partly on the charm of Redford and the appeal of Streisand . They could have done almost anything and it would have been a hit . Notice that the whole thing rests on the power of the actors . The closest thing to a special effect is a zoom-in . The music thread that weaves throughout the film is sensitive and is like icing on a tasty cake . The characters are so polar that they fascinate each other . He can't believe her brashness and the strength of her convictions . She wears him out with her unflagging enthusiasm for her causes , ( him included ) .

I don't know if this is the same Bedford that the title of the show is referring to , but I was born here in a town called Bedford in England , where I still live . For those of you that have never heard of it , it is the birthplace of comedian Ronnie Barker , and it is also famous for being the home of John Bunyan and more recently Paula Radcliffe the runner . Andy Johnson , the top English striker in soccer's Premiership , also went to my school . Batman Begins was also filmed here . The Tiger has spoken .

38429144	3527955	Re : Whoa that was sad . . . rememeber the SPOLIERS people	I don't know but killing her off at the start of the series like that was way to sudden and really not very effective .

Anyway , since when have we heard that Freddie Highmore has been cast as Artemis ? That hasn't been confirmed as far as I know . . . I like Freddie but I'd like someone a bit younger to play Artemis - he's already 14 - for the series to develop into more films . With that in mind - how about Alex Etel from Millions and the Water Horse ? He was excellent in Cranford and is obviously able to be versatile with his accents as he was Scottish in The Water Horse .

9893915	3527955	Re : He had been cast as Igor Karkaroff	That's OK , no harm done , I'd just like to know why you still insist that Durmstrang is in Ireland ? It doesn't say that in the book , however , it hints that it is somewhere very cold where you can go skiing all year round - that doesn't sound awfully like Ireland to me . I've always thought that Durmstrang was either in Scandanavia or in Russia , as these fit Viktor Krum's description in the book .

30769580	3527955	Re : OK , I gotta be honest here . . . he NAILED Moody	Erm . . . actually the book does not say that his eye is strapped on like an eye-patch , it says that his magical eye is in his eye socket like a glass eye would be , and that is what pyrocitor was referring to as the ' stupid eye patch thingy ' , which I agree is not how his eye should look .

Sadly , your ignorance has led you to make a fool of yourself by proudly and stupidly proclaiming that this is not Disney . Have you even seen this series ? It has exactly the same characters - the blue Genie , Iago the parrot and Abu the monkey - as the Disney film , characters which are trademarks of the Disney brand and nothing else . If you want further proof , go to ' Company Credits ' . The first name - ' Walt Disney Television ' - should give you a clue . A bit of advice - get the facts before you start rushing in as if you know everything . AND - DO NOT CALL YOUNG MASTER TIGER STUPID ! I am certainly not . Thank you .

22013811	1908255	Re : DVD Edition PLEASE ! ! ! !	I just scored the LD widescreen edition on eBay for $30 and copied it to DVD-R . It won't play on either of my home DVD players but plays on my Sony laptop . It will make Sunday's flight from Boston to London go much faster . I saw the film when it was released in a Cinerama theater in Monclair , NJ upon its initial release and it had quite an impact on me when I was 11 years old ( I eneded up being an automotive photojournalist ) and even watching the LD on my home theater brought back great memories . I remember Car and Driver doing a feature on its production and remembered that they converted Formular 2 cars to replicate their bigger brothers for the film . At a time ( mid sixties ) when 30 minutes of auto racing coverage on ABC's Wild World of Sports was about it for motor sports on US TV , Grand Prix was on a whole different level . While in-car cameras help bring the viewer closer to the action today , there's something different about watching this now on a state-of-the-art home theater . All this being said , why hasn't Turner or MGM released it on DVD ? With all the crap in DVD release ( like anything from Ben Aflack ) it remains a mystery why this sadly , hasn't been released .

55538307	1908255	Actors In Sink the Bismarck and The Man Who Never Was	If you enjoyed watching Sink the Bismarck , I would suggest buying the DVD of The Man Who Never Was ( 1956 ) . In watching it last night I noticed several familiar faces ( and voices ) from Sink the Bismarck ; Laurence Naismith , Geoffrey Keen and Michael Hordern . It is a well made film based on a true story in much the same way as Sink the Bismarck . The Man Who Never Was was directed by one of my all-time favorite directors , Ronald Neame , who also directed The Odessa File and Hopscotch . Would be curious as to the reactions of those of you who enjoyed Sink the Bismarck , what you thought of The Man Who Never Was . Feel free to cc me at autotronic @ aol . com . Please put Sink the Bismarck in the subject line .
93506133	1908255	Re : DVD	I agree with everyone else here that this is a great movie that deserves a proper DVD release . I was able to acquire a laser disc version - the old 12-inch digital discs - and burned a copy . Better than VHS but not the picture quality that one would expect from a stdio-released DVD . And the soundtrack is equally spectacular , a John Barry score the equal of some of his best work on the early James Bond films . Years ago I was able to get a CD copy of it but sadly , I've misplaced it . Hopefully it will turn up but I probably left it in a rental car . It's a great CD for drives in Europe .

A few days ago I was sitting around and thinking I wish Airborne was on TV so I could watch it right now cause I hadn't seen it in a while . Well , 3 days later it was on my college's Movie Channel . I turned the tv on just in time to catch the opening of the movie and tuned my roommates into it and I was so happy . I love this movie .

166853403	3353655	Re : Is this REALLY that good ?	Inception was a fantastic film . Everything I wanted it delivered . The main question as stated you have to ask yourself is which movie category you fall into : A . The typical film goer who cares for nothing more than escapism and being able to switch off their brain and enjoy a mindless easy to follow non challenging film . B . Someone who likes to be challenged , is good at keeping up with multiple situations occurring at the same moment on different levels . To have the film question you and try to get you working your mind to solve things . I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the A category . I do enjoy a mindless flick on occasion but this movie definitely falls into the B category . If you're a smart person and fit into the B category and that sounds like something you want from a film go see it . I guarantee you'll like it .
164711259	3353655	Re : SERIOUSLY EVERYONE !	The problem is this : Jaden : " Daddy daddy I wanna be the karate kid , please daddy please " Will : " Oh ok son since that's what you want , I'll just go buy the franchise for you so you can star in a remake " Jaden : " Hell yeah , that's right you will cause I'm the * beep * Me being in movies has nothign whatsoever to do with the fact that both my parents are famous " Jaden then proceeds to act every scene like any other of the million kids in youtube videos . I thought the movie was great but Jaden brought it down a ton . You could have cast any other kid in that movie and I would have enjoyed it 10x more .

160274183	3353655	Re : The Deeper Meaning Behind The Tyler Perry ( + Black Cinema ) Hate	I figure I'll voice my opinion on this . First off let me state that I am white for the record , a film major and I am a movie theater projectionist . As a projectionist I have to watch TP's films during my screenings . Now let me start off by saying I in no way have any issues at all with an all black cast . Skin color has nothing to do with the quality of acting brought forth by an individual . I also enjoy watching films involving cultures other than my own . Now my issues with TP have nothing to do with the cast , it's more so the situation and message conveyed throughout his films . I know he's a very religious man and I being not so religious sometimes find it annoying with how preachy he gets in some of his movies but then again that is why his movies are not for me . I just view his movies as the same story told over and over again with a new cast each time . If he were to tackle some new issues or to have characters that behaved somewhat differently from his previous films then I could give him more credit . It's just the fact that he releases 2-3 films a year and they feel very much the same film again and again . Now I do enjoy his television show House of Payne . I think it is an excellent show dealing with many issues and covering a broad spectrum of troubles that plague just about anybody . Now if you would try to say , " well he just doesn't respect AA cinema , " I happen to really enjoy Spike Lee and John Singleton as mentioned above . I do understand that TP caters to a specific group among the AA community as any culture is composed of sub-groups with each like and dislike . In conclusion , I just wanted to state that not all of us dislike TP because he promotes an all black cast . Some of us simply just feel he uses too many of the same techniques and stories over and over when most directors simply wouldn't be able to get away with the lack of originality .

113145511	8461655	Re : To all you Yanks	Hey , I found Corner Gas because I was watching a Cubs game on WGN , fell asleep , and woke up with it on . I kept watching , and now I stay up late simply to watch it . It's actually quite interesting - I grew up in Northern Illinois / Southern Wisconsin , but I have recently moved to North Dakota . More amazingly , I bought a small house in Manitoba - a town called Ethelbert - that is exactly the same size and type of town as Dog River ( if only less fun : ) ) . I have long planned to become a dual-citizen , and it's wonderful to see the prairie culture in such a fun light through Corner Gas . Sorry for the rambling nature of this post - Corner Gas is a great show , and Dog River reminds me of the small town I lived in when I was in Illinois , as well as the one in North Dakota and the one in Manitoba . Moreover , I actually didn't know it was a Canadian show until about three episodes in - it just seems like a Northern Rural town from either side of the border . It's sad that most Americans know so little about Canada - they are one of our biggest trading partners , and there are really no two countries in the world that share more - economically , culturally , politically , geographically , climatologically , imports / exports , language , dialect even - Canada and the States parallel each other very closely . Eh , anyways , love the show .

40623053	10156355	Re : what mall is it ?	Yep , the exterior shot at the beginning of the movie was the Beverly Center and all the rest ( interior ) was filmed inside the Sherman Oaks Galleria . . . which was rebuilt after 1999 to an open-air mall . I like the original better !
95443232	10156355	Re : Ugliest Leading Lady Ever ?	yeah , I believe this movie was filmed in Italy ( as its stated on this website ) , so the actors that actually spoke ennglish over there w / out an accent were probably hard to come by . . . hence there were limited actors to fill the part . Or , they were just willing to travel all the way to Italy to do a low-budget film ? I don't think the girl was bad-looking , maybe a little odd-looking in the face . NOT ugliest though !

575346	327955	Re : This better be good - Downey Comment	OK , don't be silly . The reason Downey managed two years of sobriety was because , ahem , he's been in prison most of that time . Drug addiction is a disease , but he's been given chance after chance - and I get the feeling that any lesser-known person would've just been kept in prison at this point . I hope the film is good . I like Downey as an actor , but , come on , this drug addiction problem is mostly his doing .
133462283	327955	Desperate Housewives .	OK , loved her on this episode , and I miss her on PUSHING DAISIES . So , hopefully , they'll keep the character around for more than just this episode , like they did with Kathryn Joosten .
137045657	327955	Incredible actress .	First noticed and appreciated her on VERONICA MARS , where she was underrated and great - willing enough to play an unlikable character in an admirable way . Then , I catch her on an episode of COLD CASE , where she played the most grounded , fascinated and complicated character - a lesbian poet who assumes a male persona in order to survive in the 1920s Harlem . Genius . Genius . Genius . And in the GREY'S ANATOMY prom episode , she was so lovely . When I saw her on the PRIVATE PRACTICE finale , I actually got excited that I was going to get to see another performance from her . So , mid-episode , I'm posting this here . Yay , Tessa Thompson .

91959250	3605955	Re : Best Zombie Killing Weapon .	I have to agree , a firearm is pretty much seperior to any blade or blunt weapon . I am all for backups , but can anyone honestly say that if given a choice between a crowbar and a handgun you wouldn't take the handgun ? Sure you can run out of ammo , but even if you have only a few boxes , you are talking about a couple hundred shots . If you have a gun that uses . 22lr you can find that at any Walmart , and a brick of about 500 rounds is maybe 15 dollars . So right there you have a reliable small caliber weapon and enough ammo to last a while . Plus a brick of 500 . 22lr rounds will weigh about as much as hammer so it isn't going to weigh you down . Also the notion that a gun will break down and wear out is silly . Most modern weapons are pretty resiliant . And cleaning a modern handgun is as easy as cleaning out a blender after making a milkshake . If you own a firearm chances are you know ho to clean it . I have a 9x9mm hand gun , I have put about 3000 round sthrough it and nothing has broken down . One last piece on firearms . If that $ # ! + hits the fan the likely hood of comming across a dead police officer is pretty good , so just grab his / hers side arm .
91959443	3605955	Re : Best Zombie Killing Weapon .	Only problem with the ACR is the ammo isn't readily avaible . A . 223 for instance is sold in the civilian market so there is more of it around .
84321860	3605955	Re : Best Zombie Killing Weapon .	I would say no one wepeon is best because there are so many different scenarios . I say a combination of a small caliber handgun , . 22lr or a 9x19 ( both are light and pretty easy to find ) . A handgun has an effective range of about 10 yards for even a pretty novice user . As long as your ammo holds up it is far supperior to any stricking weapon simply because of the range . If contact with a zombie brings risk of infection I would just assume stay as far as possible . I would also carry a blunt weapon as a back up . I would stay away from blade weapons , they require too much skill and pose a risk to the user . What would work great is a modular ice climbing tool with a hammer on the head . Just take off the pick side and you have a very strong yet light weapon that will give you about 1 1 / 2 too 2 feet of reach . Out in the open , like say in the flyover states , a nice long rifle would also be handy . once again a small caliber , or even a . 223 . Something like a ruger mini-14 would be easy to carry yet give you some decent range to reach out and touch Zack from a safe distance . No matter what you choose best start stocking up now .

Here's the thing when opinions are so violently split it's possible to find all kinds of facts supporting your arguements in one way or another . Just like the Evolution debate , both sides can find tremendous amounts of information that backs there arguement , but each sourse is bias towards there own cause , thus you get nowhere .

164282378	23344655	The Best	Steven Spielberg is probably one of the greatest director , writer , and producer in Hollywood , but he also has some horrible movies like Jurassic Park 2 , Transformers 2 , Indiana Jones 4 , or arguably The Goonies .

I think people that havent read / dont particularly care about or enjoy the books like the film whereas people like me who are totally in love with those books hate what he has done to HBP . Exactly ! I've come to realize , though is that the people who love Yates ' movies are only seeing them for the 10 second action scenes and / or the love story . Then there also the people who love Yates that are in denial and believe that the reason why the Potter films are terrible is because of Steve Kloves . But in reality Kloves had nothing to do with The Order Of The Phoenix ( the first Potter film with Yates ) and that movie still sucked . They also do not understand that if Kloves is to blame for how terrible these last films have been , then why were the first two really good while he was writing the screen play for them .

166111412	23344655	Boy ! That was rushed .	I know it's long but I would love your feedback on this . It's my first review of this depth . Beware of spoilers . First off , If you do decide to see this movie ( which I do not recommend ) , remember not to blink other wise you might be watching the credits . After the beginning where the main character ( Aang , Katara , and Sokka ) are in the Southern Water Tribe , they quickly end up in the Northern Water Tribe . With only 30 minutes left in the movie , it somewhat slows down . The movie went so fast through our heroes ' journey , that there was no time for character development or background . You barely get to know the character at all in this movie . If I had not already seen the cartoon series , then I probably wouldn't have known the characters names or why Aang was so mad when he found Gyatso ( meaning they didn't fully explain the relationship they had ) . Speaking of character names , for the life of me I can't think of a single reason as to why they change the character names , like Avatar , Sokka , Aang , Iroh , and even the term Agni Kai , pronunciations were changed . What was wrong with the way they said the names in the show . Now call me a purist , but because this movie was so rushed , it left out many crucial facts needed to develop a full story and character personalities as stated before . Most of the time the story decide to take an alternate path to interpret the story then that of the show . Like when Zuko and Iroh are in the fire nation colony discussing Zuko's past ( which is the only time this happens ) and a little kid explains it . Now how hard is it to use the story already provided , especially if the movie claims it's an adaptation of the show ( which it is far from an adaptation ) ? The bending in my opinion was terrible , bender spent 5 minutes ( exaggeration , but you get the point ) waving their arms , stomping their feet , and spinning around like tops , before they can actually bend anything . I notice most of the time it was Aang and Katara that spent most of their time dancing and not bending . On that note when our heroes make their way to an earth-bending prison and cause a riot , there is scene where the camera shows 10 or so earth-benders stomping and waving their arms , before they send a rock the size of a fat cat slowly whizzing by . Now I was very disappointed to see fire-benders be degraded from the shows standards to the movie standards . If there is any justification for changing names on this movie , I would say change fire-benders to fire-manipulators . The inability for fire-benders to make their own fire ( except for Iroh ) , made me question if they actually stood a chance at war , yet alone win . Minor things kept popping up through-out the entire movie that just added to my frustration . Such things like the abrupt introduction of the fire-lord . Again call me a purist , but I think it would have been better to do as the show and only show a shadowy silhouette , behind a wall of flames . Only to reveal his identity in the third movie ( if there is even a possibility there will be a trilogy , lets just hope not ) . This would use the Darth Vader complex to a degree , never seeing the face of evil until the end . But while I'm talking about the fire-lord I have to say I liked this guy's voice , it really sounded like what an evil-villain's voice should sound like . Another frustrating part was at the end when Aang makes a wall of water contrary to the giant water monster from the show . Was there anything wrong with the original story of the Northern Water Tribe siege ? I am not good at spotting good acting from bad ; however I was under the impression that all of the actors / actresses were reading a teleprompter the whole time and that they all sounded like robots while they were reading . Katara really annoyed me ; most of the times she looked like she had just gotten done crying and in no way did she properly represent the character Katara from the show . To me when I watch the show I get the impression that Katara is a feminist with the attitude that women can do whatever men can do and do it better . But the depth of Katara's character on the movie is practically transparent , the same going for all of the character , but her is just plain pathetic . Now I know it's impossible to cram everything into one movie . That why I now think ( since watching the movie ) , that there should have been a two parter , because everyone of the 20 episodes of book one , are so full of detail and explain so much , that adds to the overall story , that it's impossible to cram it into an hour and 45 minutes . That's if people insist on a movie of the show , I myself believe there is just too much content in the show , that there is no way to make this show into a good movie . No matter how many times you make it . It will always be lacking enough detail to complete the story , unless of course you made 6 hour movie , but no one would want to see that . As for the 3D , I recommend watching it in 2D it's the same thing . Unfortunately the theater I went to had no 2D option so I spent an extra 3 buck on 3D . In the end I spent my time watching the movie without my 3D glasses and noticed no difference in picture quality . What I mean is that it wasn't blurry like the usual 3D movie when you take off you special glasses . In any case I was screwed out of my 3 extra bucks that I didn't even want to spend in the first place . I give this movie one star out of ten . Now if you want a good movie I suggest seeing Grown-Ups . I watched this right after The Last AirBender and end my day to the movie on a happy note . " What is so great about discovery ?

Classic examples of this are : The Korean War 1950's The Vietnam War 1950's - 1970's ( though we formally went to war in 1963 we still had a presents over there in the 1950's ) AFghanistan 1980's - 1990 then 2001 - present ( 2001 is a result of the 9 / 11 attackes ) " The only thing we have fear is . . . fear it's self .

165872146	23344655	Re : My asian friends laugh at racebendig . com etc .	McCarthyism , was a witch hunt started by Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy ( hence the name ) in the mid 1950's . McCarthy accused multiple people of the State Department of being Communist sympathizer or spies for the Soviet Union . As a result McCarthy received lots of media attentions . The attention gave McCarthy more influence and power , but as people watch his inquiries on tv they realized that he was a bully . I you read the book Crucible , you'll realize that it directly parallels the Salem Witch Trials of the 1690's to the McCarthy State Department inquiry of the 1950's .

164254750	23344655	Not what I expected	through-out the entire movie there were many dissapointing part . just to name a few ; one of the biggest disappointments was that there were no sand monsters . I kept waiting for the sand monster to appear , slow as the movie progressed I realized that there weren't going to be any sand monsters of any kind . The second disappointment was the fact that they make the hero prince seem like a pathetic orphan , trying to prove himself to the whole world . Which is to say that this is an over used story plot turned cliché . And finally the third major disappointment was the seriously mis-timed kissing scene . The writers decided that it would make more sense to have the hero and his love interest kiss ; with only minutes to save the world . As well as many more minor disappointments through-out the entire movie

47484830	5445555	Re : Is Keenan dying ?	okay this is what i got from the movie . The character Keenan and his ex-girlfriend " shared everything " from the stumble in his voice while delivering the line , you later learn that his ex was also a needle drug user , thus . . . . connecting that Keenan was too because they " shared everything " . Now it was also stated that Keenan was faithful only to her , but she " shared " with other people . He was then infected with what we are lead to assume is HIV positive , although i guess it could have ben Hep . OR . . . it could be that neither he nor his ex were users , and that she was just stupid enough to sleep around with junkies who shared needles . And then through sex passed it on to him . AS FOR . . . the Spreading of the disease ( lets say HIV for arguments sake ) directly from the Trojan condom web site : " Using latex condoms each time and every time - - the right way - - can help reduce your risk of getting or giving an STD . During sex , using a latex condom is the only way to help protect yourself and your partner against HIV / AIDS . " So as you can see condoms do help PREVENT the spreading of STD's including HIV , but nothing can 100 % guarantee you not contracting the disease other then knowing 100 % by being tested and by having your sexual partners tested BEFORE engaging in any physical sexual relationship . THUS . . . Keenan and Joan could have a very cautious physical relationship , but must rely on the non-sexual physical , and of course emotional relationship for under the surface connection .
48312167	7486255	Re : Big Gun ?	all of the videos are from the 70's and 80's even though the razors edge was released in 1990 all of the videos on family jewels were released as singles before the album was released in 89 . rock your heart was released after the album so its not on family jewels and big gun was also released in 1990 . i dont know why its creditied though .
105830922	5079155	Re : Great movie , but . . .	Gunn MEANT it to be a homage to the films you mention above . He says so in the DVD extras . He LOVES those films and uses names from them and scenes from them to pay tribute to how they were great to him . I think that even though I did not know that at the time ( watching the extras after the film ) , and knowing that it was " ripping off " movies I have seen already while I watched it I was still greatly entertained and loved it so much I watched it again right afterward . I just could not get enough of it . I truly think Gunn did a fabulous job with this movie and I now plan to add it to my personal library , not just my queue . As Murdock said above it makes it's own mark as a horror film . An indelible mark that hopefully others will enjoy enough to copy someday .
108232083	5079155	Re : what the . . . . ( spoiler )	Seems to me that is just your opinion . Which of course you entitles to , but I think it played better the way it was .

" Heck her voice did not even sound the same ! I hate that she did that to herself . I really do . And whomever the actress was that said that quote that was so right on . And Julianne Moore is a great example that you do NOT need botox or other crap done . She still looks great at her age . As does Rene Russo .
95513507	5079155	Re : ABSOLUTE GARBAGE like this . . . . .	I LOVE this movie for exactly the reason WaitingFTS56 said . It is NOT supposed to be a horror film . It is supposed to be funny and preposterous and it was . I laugh so hard and could watch it over and over . And I think that is why they had David Arquette as the lead . He is funny . I think some people need to stop taking movies so damn seriously . My favorite movies are the ones that take me away from my problems and make me engrossed in them . This movie does that for me . I have fun and do not think of bills or any other problems when I watch it .
162514724	5079155	Re : My take on the film .	I think also if you think about the scene where Teddy and Chuck have to give up their guns , it is kind of telling that Chuck is NOT used to guns because he has some problem with getting the holster off his belt . Just do not seem him being a Marshall and having such a problem with that . And I think the end , where Teddy / Andrew says something to the extent of " Do you want to live as a monster or die as a hero ? " it is him saying WHY he would rather NOT remember he was Andrew . Andrew allowed his crazy wife to kill their 3 children and then he had to kill her . Only a monster could do that , in his eyes . So he would rather go back to being a US Marshall and his wife having died in a fire , him being childless and NOT responsible for all the deaths of his loved ones . I mean really , IF you were Andrew , would YOU want to live with that memory ? Or would you want some alternate reality ? I know I would just have a mental break and stay there . That is my take on the film . And no , I will not be posting again , as I do not make a habit of hanging out on these boards arguing points . So whatever someone says in response , I will not care .
121685845	5079155	Re : Vote : Kristanna Loken or Natassia Malthe ?	I will go with Malthe as well . Now if they could just dye the hair the correct color and give her GREEN eyes instead of her brown ( contacts people - look into them ! ! ! ) she could easily be Rayne as she is sexy enough .
159992654	5079155	Re : Did Rebecca just vanish off the face of the Earth ?	In another thread I just talked about this . I hate that they brought in " Amelia " as a love interest when they do not mention ANYTHING about why his last love interest is not still his love interest . Just such poor writing ! And I much prefer Rebecca over Amelia or even the new girl also played by Amy Adams . Are to assume that because she LOOKS like Amelia he would just be instantly in love and everything works out ? Nope more like because she looks like Amelia he is thinking with something else , like the Amy Adams ' derriere lovers on this board : P Such a disservice to the movie to just dismiss Rebecca , IMO .

130969454	5079155	Re : Things that annoyed me about this movie . . .	Yea , I could NOT get over Flounder being brave .

I could not understand why they could not work her in . Heck they could have had Ursula being the governess and her plotting would have been why she was banished . But nope . Nothing about her . I liked the movie , as I love all things Ariel , but I was disappointed in it .

113187599	5079155	Re : I just found out Big Budget Studio does the Bell Witch Story w / big s	Yea , I saw An American Haunting and I have to say I was truly let down by the movie . Especially the incest storyline . I know the writer / director was just putting in HIS take on what caused the problems , but why go that route ? ! ? There is NO documented stuff to suggest John Bell had any odd interests in his daughter , so why imply it ? ? Yes , I know it has been implied before , but not many people have heard of the story ( I had not before I watched the movie ) , so they , if they are not the kind of people like I am that like investigating " based on true events " , will just accept that as the way it went . Ah well .

116361032	5079155	Re : the letter from chicago scene	It was the picture of Kieran and Fiona that John Cusack's character took on the beach .

116361303	5079155	Re : Very Good Movie ! !	I am just going to ignore the post from vdsc . I agree so much .

I cannot look at him in anything now without thinking of Kieran .
108233059	5079155	Re : Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey were . . .	I would also have to disagree . I think when he and she are dancing at the park they look like they truly like being in each others arms . Plus the scenes where they make each other laugh ( like the scene with the statue ) look like the scene was fun for both of them . I actually feel that Matt and Jenn had more chemistry in that movie than Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan did in Sleepless in Seattle . Just my opinion mind you . Just like yours is that there is no chemistry in this movie between its stars .

127012991	5079155	Re : Would have been great . . . .	I definitely agree here . I liked the film , but I wanted so much more . I may spoil some thing for people who have not seen it , but then why be reading this if you haven't ? ? It is hinted at that Bishop took over the " family " from Arturo ( the Alchemist ) , so why does Sadie not go back and confront him when she finds this out . I would have were I to find out he was the one who started this . I mean Arturo could HAVE been wanting Sadie to do his dirty work and kill Bishop so he could take back the power Bishop took . See that would have been kind of interesting I think to have Sadie find out she is being used by Arturo ( where did she get the name the Alchemist ? ) for his own ends . Plus I think the film needed WAY more father / daughter stuff BEFORE Tricia dies so we could see how their relationship was . PLUS Ethan finding the website from a phone number for a party that Tricia did not even want to go to ? Her friend was the excited one , so why would Tricia invite others along ? I just did not understand all that .
146174972	5079155	Re : Wait , Vampires can have babies ?	Viktor says to Sonja ( I am paraphrasing here ) " My only regret is your mother had to die for you to be born . " I assumed there that Sonja's mother was human and died giving birth to a vampire baby . Which I guess makes Sonja dhampir ? ? ? I would though also like an explanation as to why they go from babies to nearly 30 and then just STOP aging . Like Selene . She was turned as a girl and then just reaches mid 20's and stops for the rest of her life as a vampire . Why ? I can assume , like someone has said that they do age , just much much slower than you or I , BUT maybe the writers could mention that . Loved this film though .

That is why I finally bought it . Their chemistry is adorable and I just think Jennifer is great in this film . I definitely like this one over Maid in Manhattan or anything since .
123747136	5079155	Re : P2 an insult to women everywhere ?	I am sure P2 is NOT an insult to women everywhere . There are far worse films that insult me and make me hate the filmmakers . ( I am a woman , in case you are wondering ) I do feel the dress was a tad revealing . Especially as I was thinking " You were going to wear that dress at your sister's Christmas party with your mom and dad and the kiddos around ? ! " But that was the ONLY decision I thought was a poor one on her part ( just trying to imagine the family looking at the choice of apparel for a family dinner ) . Oh , I did feel her stabbing him in the back was a bad decision , so I amend the top opinion . I feel a better plan would have been to stab in the neck . Wait til he raised his head a little and then get him in the jugular . I sure he would have bled more from that . But as someone else said , I do not know what I would have done in that case , having just come to , and wanting to get away . I hope I just remind myself to go for neck , not back or chest . I felt it was well done with her coming to from the chloroform and enough time had passed before she was off an running . Remember when she stabbed him she did not make it out the door , nor put up much of a struggle ( IMO ) . Now THAT would have been not believable . Her being able to make it out the door after just barely coming to . And I would have definitely been off and running after watching him kill Jim the way he had . That was gory , but in a realistic way , so it was not offensive to me . Not like the Saw or Hostel movies which were gore for gore's sake . I do have a gripe that NO cars had car alarms on them ? On Star ? Nor did they have air bags ? ? That did bother me . But that's not her . Just poor story premise . Wes was fantastic . I was not scared by Tom , but more creeped out . His whole incapability to understand why she would do things when he was " just trying to help her out " just bothered me . Maybe because I have been there and experienced an oddball like that . One who really bothered me in his thinking that he was not doing anything wrong with stalking me . So , besides the problems I mentioned with her dress and the cars , I thought the movie was great . Yes , the story is not new , but this movie definitely did the story way better than alot of others I have seen . And I am still not insulted by it .
116141164	5079155	Re : most disgusting terrible movie EVER	See having bought it to get Queen of the Damned proves , IMO , that the OP does not have a good grasp on good films .

I do think it is lazy and juvenile to write on a message board like you are texting on your phone , but I think he gets his point across well .
159117046	5079155	Re : Am I the only one here who LIKED this movie ?	I think this movie is seriously funny ! I laugh so hard when I am watching it . In fact I am watching it now for like the 6th time since seeing it at the drive in . My favorite Adam Sandler movie !
71001014	5079155	Re : i LOVED this movie ! ! !	I agree . I watch this movie every time it is on TV , as it is just so funny to me . The models are hilarious , Monica Potter is so cute and quirky and Freddie Prinze is so charming . It is just fun to watch over and over for me . My husband had never seen it so I rented it from Netflix ( wanted him to see it with no commercials and unedited ) and he loved it . He now says we should just buy it , as I watch it so often . Not my favorite movie , but definitely a fave . I wish they made more movies like this .
118295482	5079155	The Shadow Monster	If the shadow monster is pure life essence why would it be afraid of light ? Light GIVES life . Especially the sun . Or so I am told See the movie would have been so much better if everyone was trying to move about the hospital in the dark because the monster wanted the lights on so it could kill them all . Does that make sense ? I mean the movie had promise , and I do so LOVE James Marsters , but I kept thinking it makes no sense for PURE life essence to be afraid of the dark . Plus not only did I think of " Cube " when watching it , but the Kate and " Jack " being married and her not wanting anything to do with him when she finds out who he really was , reminded me of " Resident Evil " where Alice remembers her life and that she is married to the other amnesiac and wants nothing to do with him . I think it would have been better if she were not married to him , as I just find it hard to believe that , while the guy and the monster are attacking her , Jack would not let slip her name or " honey " or something like that . I mean if he really loved her like he said he did , anyway .
140498745	5079155	Re : Great Cast - Crap Film	I agree completely . I so wanted to see this , loving all of the actors . But the movie was just . . . . crap .

" It was not just that she was so perky , it was just that she was so damn talkative and annoying . I am not sure if Carla Gugino was just smart and said " I do NOT want to be in that crap " or they just decided they NEEDED to give " Larry " someone new ( I like to think it was the first one ) , but I am sad that did away with Rebecca . I liked that character .

Still , it looks great and I believe it's showing at The Edinburgh Film Fest , so a chance for me to catch it there next month hopefully !

114446525	19565055	Second best gangster movie after goodfellas	I might say that because it's true . Godfather is a great movie too . but i cant include it as a gangster movie . Godfather is a great ordinary drama movie because it dont have enough violent scene to be called as a gangster movie . see , Gangster movie is a movie that can bring us to an intens situation that we can feel a bit scary for that is the kind of feeling we got if we live around these gangster , because we could get whack anytime you know . and i dont have that feeling watching Godfather instead of watching donnie brasco and goodfellas . another gangster movie in my opinion : Casino , Scarface , The departed , etc As far back as i can remember i always wanted to be a gangster

114179257	19565055	poor Kevin	I feel sorry for Kevin Costner . he made this piece of art movie with everything he had . and it wasn't easy to make this movie i beleieve . from what i read from many sources . the budget were blowing out of prediction . And the crew were spend their most of time in cold water all the time on the movie production . and the way i saw , this is a great two thumbs up movie . I even dare to compare this movie with dances with wolves . But this movie turn out to be failed in the market , and many " not so smart " movie critic put a large of nonsense review about how bad this movie is . And i thing this is why the movie gain such a low benefit in the box office . because people just like myself got a pause to watch this movie for they thingking that this movie was as bad as those film critic said it was . but once they try to watch this , they probably had the same opinion with me " howcome a movie as great as this beeing called as the worst movie in hollywood " . maybe those film critic freak just dont like kevin that they put him in a such missery .

81724953	12759255	' Its not clever its painfully simple ! '	I watched this movie 4 the 1st time the other day and i gotta agree that its not very good . Anybody that says that it has any basis in reallity is slightly out of touch with it themselves and the plot is weak . 1 ) the lightning strike thing . . . What was that ! ? 2 ) women dont enjoy being raped , not now , not then not ever ( this is a warped fantasy ) 3 ) the plague thing was a joke ( makes good cinema though i can forgive ) 4 ) near the end she obviously berayed them and they just forgave her and their all buddy buddy wtf ? 5 ) at the beginning they destroyed the city gates without seige by running at them ? 6 ) why did the nun have a mounted gun pointed into the streets anyway and why hide behind a cutain ? What happened to that thoroughly unnecessary sub plot anyway ? 7 ) cannon shots dont explode they make tiny little holes 8 ) look at the time difference between the room being completely on fire and him escaping from the window , sorry but hed be dead dead dead . . . . Dead ! And who cares his chracter couldnt be more 2-dimentionally selfish and evil . its not clever its painfully simple ! 9 , 10 , 11 i could go on but i rate it 6 / 10 for cheap kicks and 2 / 10 for basis in reallity . . . because there are no aliens .

114035779	12759255	Re : Pompous ass	As i have no doubt that i am about to discover first hand , arguing , or indeed , debating with morons such as Bush can be quite frustrating and while generally this is ok because those around you get who's actually right . On occasions such as this when the voters dont get it either ( because many are as stupid as him ) it becomes incredibly frustrating . yeah imagine if Gore had become president , that would have been terrible , your country might have lost all of its international credability ha ha ha . In short , it is easy to come aross as " Pompous " to the monumentally stupid because they think your looking down on them . . . which you do . . . because their stupid .

68111143	12759255	Re : When will there be a good African-American movie ?	I would like to critisise this topic for the following reasons : a ) It missing the point that comedy , sport and music are all parts of african american culture . ( As good a thing to make a film out of as anything ) b ) Black people ( or african americans ) star in films as business men and bankers etc all the time but Gangs and vionlence ( ghetto life ) are common in largely black areas . Im not being racist ( Its called reality ) , black people are always reminding us of this fact . What you are suggesting is having an " african american film " presumably staring all black american people acting as if they're white . Can you think of anywhere in america that is like this . Its like making a sex and the city spin off based in somalia staring all japanease people . In closing : if your going to make a film about african americans , make it about african americans . Another good topic idea might be " why is it always sandy in egytion films " or " why dont they speak english in asian cinema . Q : When will there be a good African-American movie ? A : There have been loads !

( that every single prson that is ever likely to review this film on this website was never going to like it because its not aimed at them ) In fact this film flopped ! So i guess that the demographic is very small indeed . i guess its restricted to those that dont own DVD players or cant reach cinemas . Plz reply if you can think of another reason i'd be quite interested to hear it .

135238691	601355	Re : Is this a B-class ?	Lance Henriksen is a great actor , probably the best character actor of our time . What I've always admired about him is that he WORKS - - whether it's an alimony movie or something better . Have you seen " The Garden " or " Bone Dry " ? Bone Dry is excellent and the commentary by Lance & the director is very funny . I only wish some director would see Lance's extensive talent and pick up on it . Just a wish . . . . . sigh . . . dark*street2

Not every movie is going to be a block-buster ( in fact , most aren't ) but when I watch the credits I'm astonished by the sheer numbers who get a paycheck in the movie industry . ( probably our largest employer ) ; > ) I wonder why the DVD of this sci-fi flic can't be found - - at least I can't find it . I've seen Lance in just about every movie he's ever made , and I've NEVER seen " Assistant to Mr . Henriksen " . I think he would view this as pretentious & a waste of $$ .

43991196	10736255	I Loved Rodney !	My favourite character was Alex Rodney , played by Tony Curran . I am embarassed to say , I let a few tears escape when my beloved Alex died from the fatal shot ! Okay , am I sounding too obsessed ? : D : D Anyway . . . is anyone obsessed with Rodney as I am ? And I am even more embarassed when I tell you that I am actually writing a FanFiction for it , and in my fic Rodney lives and has a fiance named Sadie ( my name ) ! ! hehe . . .

43989745	10736255	Re : The movie is cut off at the end	I did think it was slightly " chopped " off . Yes , there is the end credits with the pictures , but that is after they've gone home and done what they needed to do . What about when they landed ? What about when Americon ( or whatever the oil company is ) hears about it , and comes up with an excuse for not mounting a search ? What about when people find out about the dead ( - cries - I loved Rodney ! ! TONY CURRAN ! ) ? But , I guess I do that to all of the movies ! I haven't seen the original , nor have I read the book . . . are they any good ? Are they worth seeking out to purchase ? . . . thanks !

44559896	10736255	Re : Would'nt they get sunburned from working in the sun ?	: P . Yeah , you don't quite notice it . But , when it's the scene where James changes Sammi's song , Liddle's face is not that great . Rodney's shoulders are a bit bad before he gets shot , but that's it , nothing too huge . You'd think under the July Gobi sun that their skin would be peeling ! ( lucky for me I've never " burned " : P )
43991566	10736255	Re : tie-in to SNATCH	No , I didn't notice this . . . but ! I'd just like to say that the Irishman is actually a Scotsman ! Sorry - I just have an obsession with Tony Curran , the guy who plays him , and I had an impulse to correct the error ! hehe
44561455	10736255	Re : Best Line in Flight of the Phoenix ( 2004 )	Anything with Rodney is good ! I love Rady's speech after James says he can walk to Langhu . F-u-n-n-y . I also like when Rady's putting Phoenix on the side of their plane . - This isn't a favourite line , but my favourite scene is when James changes Sammi's soul song and AJ's dancing , et cetera . I always rewind to that one a bunch of times : P

162205591	8817755	Re : Does anyone actually agree with Larry sometimes ?	Larry is almost always right . Its just not socially appropriate to act the way he does , and call people out the way he does . The show wouldnt be funny if he wasnt doing what people are thinking .
158972838	8817755	Why the Marriage Ref is a good show	I saw the oprah episode where seinfeld as promoting the show , and all I could think is this show is stupid . I thought the center of the show was the marriage problems , and that they were all over the top / stupid / and would get old very quick . But I gave the episode a try last night and I realized , the show does not know its strength . The best part of the show is the interactions between the celebrities . I love Larry David . It was incredible to just listen to him make fun of the wackjobs who submitted tape ! When else do you see Larry David and Madonna interacting ? its hilarious . I used to watch reruns of the gameshow matchgame on gameshow network and I think that like matchgame , this show is all about seeing celebrities together . i think this show would serve better as a game show esq show where celebrities loved to come on , and make fun and argue together . I think they should advertize to the TMZ audience and I think it should be all about which celebs are coming on this week . Some celebs should be regulars , I would love it if Larry David came back a lot . Not to mention Ricky Gervais , how amazing to see the three of them interact . that was the best part of the show . I laughed so much . So dont watch the show for the marriage drama , look at those clips as pure ridiculousness and just enjoy listening to the panel . Its awesome when you arent taking the marriage problems seriously . Anyone agree ?
161854626	8817755	no from this moment on ? ? ? ? ?	ARE YOU KIDDING ME ! ! ! i waited all episode for it , i thought for sure siobahn was going to do it at the end and then she sang that bad song , if she was going to sing a fun one why not man i feel like a woman or dont impress me much ! ahhh sooo pissed from this moment on is too good to pass up !

151318409	8817755	Re : Season 2 episode 8	ya erica and ethan are done . . . . in her voiceover in the end when she said , " stop believing in fairytales " she was talking about the fairytale of marrying your best friend after years of not being together . . . that isnt there story , they arent meant to be together . . . and sex isnt shallow . . . if theres chemistry between two people they will have good sex , if the sex is bad it isnt some completely independant thing . . . it has to do with the relationship . . . and it was just weird the always candles and pedals and cheesey stuff . . . turn off

140371501	8817755	Re : Are there any shows out there similar to Felicity ? Please help .	well another really good WB show ( or atleast in the first few seasons ) is gilmore girls , id try that or gossip girl if you havent watched that already . also , freaks and geeks , it doesnt have the dramatics of a WB show but its absolutely incredible , i highly recommend it . also , watch greys anatomy if you havent already , the cast is older but its got all the great drama and love triangles of those shows !
163896698	8817755	Re : Um , Why Does Charlotte Have a Nanny ?	that has absolutely nothing to do with what people are typing about but thank you for illustrating exactly what this thread is really about . there is obviously nothing wrong with charlotte having a nanny as long as she is still present . the problem people have with it is that they resent people who have more money than them .

162380469	8817755	i once had to stop eating meat for 6 months	so in the episode where the politician asks carrie to pee on him , after samantha says she accidentally peed on a guy once , charlotte says , i once had to stop eating meat for 6 months . i dont get the joke ? does that have anything to do with peeing ? or was it just her trying to change the subject ? sorry if it is obvious , but can someone explain ?
163970550	8817755	Re : Um , Why Does Charlotte Have a Nanny ?	okay , so person who made the argument about flipping the gender roles here is my response . if there was a stay at home dad with 2 kids under three and he had someone help out I would not say that he is a dead beat dad ? your argument is flawed because of your bias towards what men do in the home , you are flipping the genders but not flipping the role those genders play . either way , it sounds like to me you are all judging this situation from a perspective of never having a nanny . isnt it convienient to deem this process you cant afford as bad ? of course it is possible for moms to be absent and have a nanny do everything but it is also possible for moms who dont have nannies to be absent too . the nanny isnt the issue , the parenting is . if someone wants to be a good mother , it can only help to have a nanny be there .

165121506	8817755	' never fail to undervalue ' harry potter	Sorry if this is a stupid question but I cant wrap my head around it . In harry potter and the half blood prince , dumbledore tells harry he is kind like his mother , a trait that people ' never fail to undervalue ' . what does that mean ? that people always value kindness , or that people always undervalue kindness ? I say the latter my sister says the former but I'm not sure .

123038476	8817755	who else thinks s+s is a tragedy	everytime i read it i think the same thing , marianne belongs with willoughby and edward is a loser . first of all , brandon is just old , boring and never got over his first love . thats the only reason he likes marianne because he reminds her of eliza . as well , there is no way marianne loves him , come on . marianne , arguably the most emotional character in all the jane austen novels says ONE positive thing about him ; in time she loved him as much as willoughby . all the passion in the novel took place with willoughby and marianne and i wish they ended up together . second , edward and that lucy steele business . just so unattractive . and then that whole loop jane austen had to write in , the whole robert taking over . just dumb . i think jane austen felt obligated to give her characters " happy " endings so she pretended with brandon and marianne as well as edward and elinor . but i think she secretely wanted this book to be ironically depressing . the emotional one settles for something reasonable and the reasonable one settles for something emotional . what a sad book .
164810464	8817755	Re : Why don't people understand this ?	What the hell is Starbuck ? My take was , everyone has a destiny . Kara died before she completed hers , but like she says in the finale , nothing you can do can stop you from your fate . So she was an angel , or whatever , until her destiny was completed at which point seh moved on . You are right that we dont have a clear definitive answer but I think we have enough to be satisfied here . Would an entire fleet of people really give up their technology ? who is to say that some people did not complain or were upset ? all we know is that the resistance wasnt that strong . I dont see why it is incomprehensible that after years of living through that torture , that the people on the whole would accept this and desire a change . How long would an advanced race of humans survive on a primitive planet with no technology or experience in such an environment ? If hera was the ' eve ' then maybe all the other humans were not able to sustain themselves . only this crossbreed was able to . given what we know about hera as a 2 year old , it seems possible to me that she was able to survive the elements . Why did Adama have to leave Lee and the others for good ? who said he had to ? he decided to , you dont have to like that decision , but that isnt an unanswered question of the series . I thought the same thing , alone time may be nice for a week , but wouldnt you go crazy after a while , wouldnt he rather be with his son ? but that doesnt mean its impossible that he would rather just do what he did . Why did Anders have to die ? well unless they were going to bring technology onto the new earth , how would sam survive ? Should we just forget how badly Tyrol treated Cally ? who said we are supposed to forget that ? just because he was wrong to cally once , doesnt mean he can never do the right thing and kill the person who killed her . and i dont like the blaming him for unconsciously beating her . he was a jerk , but not a physical abuser in my opinion . How is Hera " mitochondrial Eve " ? earlier you say how can the humans survive , and here you say they had to have . maybe only hera's advanced combination of dna was what was able to successfully reproduce over the 150 , 000 years . Isn't it an amazing coincidence that not only human life , but animal life as well , evolved exactly the same way on different planets light-years apart ? well how did they speak english too right ? if the end shows us our society , the english language definately wasnt around 150 , 000 years ago . . . here is where for practical purposes of a tv show some questionable things have to happen , and if that isnt good enough then this goes to the god answer . god guides evolution , makes it to make humans like us now . Wasn't Earth 1 supposed to be our planet because the constellations from Kobol matched up to ours ? " Again , how is it possible that in the entirety of the universe there are two galaxies that have the same exact planet structure and star formations ? " not likely at all , but that isnt impossible . Did that opera house vision really just mean that Baltar / Caprica had to carry Hera five feet ? well hera is the reason the human race survived , and those visions are what made those people know keeping her around was so important . so the visions were that they would know keeping her was extremely important Why did Cavil kill himself ? when he realized he lost he chose to end it his own way . like a machine would do . What was the deal with Daniel ? the deal wasnt that important , but we still learned some things from him . like how its important to have imperfections , and that cavil had major issues with helen because of him . Did all the evil Cylons die in the nuclear blast ? well if they did they were around the new earth 150 , 000 years later so who cares . In whose mind were " Head " Six and Baltar supposed to be existing in during the coda ? I interpreted it as us seeing the angels , why do angels have to exist only to baltar and 6 and not independently . Were the Cylons right about the One God thing all along ? I never thought we were supposed to get an answer to this . . . Was this entire series really about teaching us that robots are dangerous ? That is only one of many things I got out of the series . For me , the biggest message was it has happened before and it will happen again but maybe this time it wont . . . I just finished the series about 2 hours ago and I dont know what this official backstory you talk about is so if anything I said is obviously wrong I am sorry . This is just my fresh interpretation . Maybe because LOST had absolutley no answers I feel this series did a great job of ending the series . none of these questions seem to be deal breakers like WTF is the light ! !

I love pixar in general , but i was wondering how many people who loved it when they were the original audience went to see it again without and kids . . . I went to the 9 45 showing last night and there were very few kids . . . it seems like this movie gathers every age group , either the young kids , the parents of young kids , or those in between who loved it when they were young

I'm sure Jerry's rabbi would not approve of celebrating christmas but that doesnt mean lots of jews dont do it . Christmas is such a commercialized aspect of north american society that us jews often feel like we are missing out ! so at my house one year we had a chanukah bush , essentially a christmas tree haha ! so ya , in principle jews should not be doing those things , but in practice lots of jews will do those things because its so appealing in a culture way , like halloween .

162901638	8817755	Re : Does Canada get this episode before the US ?	ya private practice isnt one of the shows that airs early . but there are two ways we can get episodes early . 1 . In canada , we still get abc / fox / cbs / nbc but we also have our own networks , ctv and global ( the big ones ) that get the rights to the big american network shows . so sometimes , ctv or global will get the rights to two american shows that air at the same time . when that happens , sometimes we get the show earlier . like vampire diaries is on at 7 pm . 2 . And like the other person said , where americans have east and west , we have even further east , so sometimes we get shows an hour earlier too , by watching that eastern channel . but it is only with certain shows , like we would never get lost early .

I also found it really nice when she talked about her insecurities about not being pretty anymore , very relatable and shows how even people who i think are so pretty can be insecure . shes honest , which is more than we can say about most of the housewives . I am looking forward to seeing more of her in future seasons !

161483773	8817755	Re : Kailyn seemed so ungrateful	thats what i thought at first , but then i realized its because she really looks at them as her parents . not her boyfriends parents . she feels their love so much and loves them back so much that she is herself with them and relies on them and can be at her weakest with them . she isnt scared they are going to kick her out if she isnt perfect . so doesnt feel the need to suck up to them all the time , or that they are only being nice to her because of their son , they have her back independent of jo . so i think the fact that they have that close and strong of a relationship shows how much she does love them and appreciate them .
160205170	8817755	favorite episode	only pick one , i know its hard ! mine changes but these days its ' the man the myth the viagra ' i think every story line was amazing ! samantha and the old man is hilarious , carries face when big arrives is just such a moment ! not to mention the great miranda and steve stuff ! haha

163129737	8817755	why the america voting argument is moronic	it was entirely self-serving for russel . he knew he was a fan favourite and a strategic player and assumed that one was because of the other . in many seasons people who are not strategic at all win fan favourite . so just like sometimes the jury votes for who they like the best and not strategy , sometimes america chooses nice people and not strategic players . he is such a sore loser . he knew the jury voting was part of the game and chose to ignore that part of the game . how is that any different from someone who decides to ignore the strategy part of the game ? I hope we dont have to see any more russel for a while , actually i take that back , i hope he comes back and now that people have seen his season before hand they will vote him out right away and he will make up some ridiculous excuse for why it was anyone but his own fault .

123892511	8817755	Re : who else thinks s+s is a tragedy	i dont think its fair to compare willougby to wickham . wickham has bad intentions and i really dont think willoughby does . willoughby is a good guy who just makes bad decisions because he is young and unguided , but i really think his heart is good . and what he did to eliza , ya it was wrong but i dont think he was trying to deceive her he just wasnt strong enough to marry her after she got pregant . and with marianne , i think you were right they were both young but i dont think it was crush , i think they found young love but the pressures of world destroyed it . had they met later on i think they would have made it work . i know jane austen rushes her endings , but she typically does it with guys who you have built up chemistry with through the entire novel , i just really dont think its there brandon . you say willoughby is obsessive like its a bad thing but marianne is obsessive , and she wears her heart on her sleeve and i just wanted her to find someone who could be as passionate with her and not be with some guy who thought she was like his first love . . . .

155068668	8817755	Re : LDS : fact or fiction ?	What everyone has to realize is there is NO absolute proof for any religion . If there was , and it was clear , everyone would follow . I am not LDS but another religion , and went to religious school my whole life . I , like you cassie , thought i had absolute proofs of my religion as well . But , what i have since learned is absolute proof takes away from the religion . faith and belief are essential to all relgions . the fact that it isnt 100 % clr but you chose to follow anyways shows a much greater effort . Imagine if everyone could hear god speak and knew if they acted a certain way they would be punished , would we admire people for acing justly ? no becuase they are doing it to avoid a known punishment . Faith , and belief , which require some amount uncertainty are what make followers of a relgion so genuine . Also , i believe relying on faith and belief are what have allowed religions to survive through out time , that way they cannot be disproved either way , it is a matter of faith . i am not educated in LDS , all i really know is what i have learned from big love and the south park episode , but i think if you were educated in other religions you would realize that the arguments you are making apply to all relgions . you think joseph smith submitting to torture is proof , well welcome to the world of religion ! do you have any idea how many martyrs there are in every relgion ? not to mention the intense and specific rules every religion has ? religion , faith and belief should be a personal thing . thats one of the things i like about my relgion , we dont believe in converting other people .

I've seen this before in my life , when there are 2 ugly sisters , but one sister is much prettier than the other , they are the pretty one in the family , they think that they are really pretty in general . if i have to hear her talk about how she is a size 1 one more time or how amazing her body is UGH ! ! ! theres nothing wrong about not being attractive its just they way she thinks she is a super model that pisses me off . . . she obviously sees the world differently than i do because she also seems to think her daughter is a model , remember when ali had the photo shoot and she was like modeling agencies are going to go nuts after this ! its like are you blind ! your daughter is fat ! ! i know i am being harsh , but she brings it upon herself

123740674	8817755	Re : who else thinks s+s is a tragedy	This is part of an essay i wrote for my Jane Austen course on who marianne really belongs with ( sorry for the formal writing ) . i just love marianne and dont think brandon meets her ' sensibility ' needs . . . i think jane austen agrees . . . . Much more of the novel focuses on Marianne's abhorrence to the thought of marrying Colonel Brandon . Upon first learning of his attraction , Marianne reflects that " Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs . Jennings , but he is old enough to be my father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlive every sensation of the kind . It is too ridiculous ! " ( 39 ) . There is no doubt that Marianne respects Colonel Brandon and appreciates his caring nature but the narrator's description of her supposed love for Colonel Brandon is shy of convincing : " Marianne could never love by halves ; and her whole heart became , in time , as much devoted to her husband , as it had once been to Willoughby " ( 352 ) . Marianne is a character who lives by her emotions and since that is the only line indicating her love for Colonel Brandon , the feelings cannot be so strong . The fact that the narrator uses the words " in time " as well as " it had once been to Willoughby " is almost humorous . It is as if the narrator is saying it took Marianne really long time just to get to a point that is only equal to that of Willoughby , not any greater , and this is her husband . There is little doubt that if Colonel Brandon had not been rich Marianne would not even have considered him . Mrs . Jennings expresses it best when she states , " it would be an excellent match , for he was rich , and she was handsome " ( 38 ) . This is not to say that status is not a reason to marry someone in that time but by the lack of almost any other explanation the narrator is revealing that it is the only reason . There is no deficiency of love on either Marianne's or Willoughby's behalf in comparison . The narrator is constantly emphasizing how strong and passionate their connection is . When Elinor doubts how realistic Marianne's feelings can be after so short a time , Marianne declares , " it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy ; it is disposition alone . Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others " ( 60 ) and that is what Marianne and Willoughby have , a love that is romantic and electric right from the beginning . The narrator describes how " when he was present she had no eyes for any one else . Every thing he did , was right . Everything he said , was clever " ( 55 ) and this is exactly what Marianne desired from a man . When she discovered the truth about Willoughby the resulting mental anguish made her physically ill to a point close to death . After a description of a love so powerful with one character it is exceedingly evident why a greater description of a love to another character is required to overcome it . The narrator refrained from giving a greater description and thus is not trying to convince the reader that Colonel Brandon is Marianne's better match . In spite of all of this the narrator could convince the reader that Colonel Brandon is a better match for Marianne by portraying Willoughby as a liar who deceives her . Prior to Willoughby's confession , the reader believes that Willoughby misleads Marianne to think he has feelings for her when he does not ; that Marianne's sensibilities make her naïve and susceptible to be taken advantage of . But all of this changes when Willoughby confesses to Elinor , because his character changes from the villain to simply one that is tragic . When Willoughby admits , " the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her " ( 299 ) and how the saddest day of his life will be the one where Marianne gets married the reader realizes that Willoughby does not entirely deceive Marianne but is just in a horrible situation . Furthermore , the narrator ends the novel with even more redeeming comments for Willoughby . The narrator explains how concerning Marianne , Willoughby " always retained that decided regard which interested him in everything that befell her , and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman ; and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after days as bearing no comparison with Mrs . Brandon " ( 353 ) . That is more than is ever said about Colonel Brandon in regards to Marianne and additionally exposes the narrator's belief that Willoughby is a better match .

163891757	8817755	movie discussion :	I hate the idea of the movies , and I do not consider them an extension of the series but little fan fiction movies . That being said , I cant resist seeing them , I watch sex and the city almost every day how can I not ? I want to hear what fans of the series thought , thats why I am posting here and not the movie board . Here are my thoughts : 1 . HOW COULD THEY DO THAT TO AIDEN ! ! ! ! in the series when carrie bumps into him on the street and he has a baby and a wife named cathy and things worked out for him , that was what aiden deserved . he had moved on from carrie and found someone who could be great to him like he was to carrie . he was the good guy who got the happy ending . i cant believe they took that away from him . What should have happened was carrie should have tried to kiss him and aiden turned her down , and then she realized all she realized . 2 . The how they met : meeting charlotte first was a surprise . Im sure its possible , but the series implied charlotte was last , she didnt know about dominic , and carrie and miranda did . 3 . How are Arabs going to feel about the movie ? 4 . Liza to single ladies - amazing .

And to say your iq will drop when you watch this movie makes me think that you just couldnt follow . It suprised me because i usually have a pretty easy time following a movies story and allusions , but this one had me on my toes , it actually took me a while to figure out what happened in the first 1 / 4-1 / 2 because i wasnt paying 100 % attention , i was just watching it .

If one was to do a film just about Clemente it would be a life-story of some kind , so this seems to be the right way to have Roberto's memory involved by having him be an inspirational center point since the story seems to be about these two brothers growing up .

15488915	1487555	Re : The Night Stalker feature films	Michael Keaton . I completely forgot . Absolutely . The Show is based in L . A . and Keaton was previously asked to join ' Lost ' for ABC . I wonder if they've asked him back for Kolchak ?
14420150	1487555	The Night Stalker feature films	If the new Frank Spotnitz TV Series is a success , they ought to turn the Richard Matheson scripts into feature films . Filmed back to back and released every Halloween . The Night Stalker , The Night Strangler and The Night Killers . Casting Kolchak right is the key . Kevin Spacey , Jeff Bridges , Micheal Keaton , Harrison Ford , Phillip Seymour Hoffman . . . Hard to pick one after Darren Mcgavin .
14634272	1487555	Re : The Night Stalker feature films	Yes , I meant the ' possible ' movie remakes . I'd just prefer to see The Nightstalker remade into a feature film rather than another TV series . Same as I'd prefer to see a 2 . 5 hour Salem's Lot Feature rather than yet another TV remake . I'm not knocking TV . The Quality aspect has certainly grown in the last 10 years , eg . X Files , 24 , Lost . But I just think people are selling the concept short by not making a fully fledged movie out of the Matheson scripts . But yeah Quaid would be great .
28260631	1487555	Re : The Night Killer ( s )	The Night Killers was supposed to be the third Kolchak TV movie . They decided on making a TV series instead . It was set in Hawaii and was about aliens replacing civic leaders / politicians with androids in a plot to take over the world . Richard Matheson and another guy wrote the script which you can find on darrenmcgavin . net . It's pretty good and would've been quite different than the usual Kolchak adventure .
17371364	1487555	Re : democratpat	Pat , ' 04626 ' sounds great . Good luck with it . I still stand by a studio remaking the original tv movies using the Matheson scripts as a basis . The Night Killers script was pretty far out and would make a great third flick . Hearing the news that Stuart Townsend has been cast as Kolchak is a bit of a joke . I like the guy but the casting is way off . Suddenly the new tv pilot seems like a big step backwards . You know if the pilot sucks , and the heat dies down on remaking Kolchak , you should change the UCLA major angle into full blown journalist , or at least have the kid working for his first newspaper .

43860282	9270555	Re : Can you say . . . . HELLO ! !	I'm the result of many generations of interracial marriages , however I was raised American Indian as that is the common culture throughout the last several generations . As someone who is attracted to just about every race in the book ( and has dated likewise . . . and it's FUN ) I have to say that I was surprised with myself as a teenager when I saw a very good looking ( American ) Indian guy dating a white girl . For the first time I became outraged at the relationship as many Indian women do . For years I listened to friends who were black complain about black men marrying white women and so on and couldn't completely understand the hold back . Scientifically , anthropologically speaking , there is only one race as far as humans go and that is , well . . . . human . What I discovered about my own outrage is that it's linked to fear . Some unfounded , some not unfounded . We are a people whose way of life is on the brink of extinction , even on our own reservations , and to see an Indian man out with a white woman or a black woman makes one worry for the future of our culture as the possible child produced could chose to accept or neglect their heritage . But I discovered most of it was simply selfishness and low self esteem . We , as human beings , are always looking for some sort of leverage in the mating game and one crutch we all like to rely on in this backwards world is race . We like to think that we only have to compete with women of our own race or cultural backround for men of interest ( and vice versa ) , but it's just not true and has never been true . Most ethnicities in this world would not exist if that were true . So we like to see something wrong with it , but there isn't , and , in truth , there is EVERYTHING RIGHT with it . To it's credit , interracial mixing ( accomplished by SEX , french Rimbaud and his Ethiopian lover included ) has saved this race from extinction and if it continues , diseases like sickle cell and crones can be wiped out . But I digress from the subject . What we fail to see is love . What we fail to see is love . What we fail to see is love . And what we promote is fear . Personally , as openminded and palleted as I like to consider myself , I was a little worn out by the love scenes in this movie for reasons beyond homosexuality ( See " Happy Together " , it was awesome ) . When the movie addressed Rimbaud's travelling days and touched on the Ethiopian woman that was his lover for most of the latter end of his life by including what appeared to me as a ' random african woman ' , there was a much relieving break for me , but I was more disappointed on the lack of content . Of course , this movie was mostly about his poetry and that period in his life , but the latter half was pretty cool , too . The African woman in the movie was an actress , however , Leonardo Di Caprio's real life lovers like ' Naomi Campbell ' and ' Mariah Carey ' are not . Go Leo , spread the love , man . And since we're talking boobs , I'm tri racial and have lingered at a D for the last several years until nursing twins and now hang out at a double d . My sister , however , has always floated in the A cup and with pregnancy is now happy that she has something to push up with her push up bra . SO the moral of the story is . . . race and boobs . . . . does it matter ? And , across cultures , all people are exotic .

Im glad for the producers of the show , obviously they hit at least one person of the target viewer profile , someone without the intelligence to realize a scripted show lying to your face .

Tänker inte gå in djupare än så , men skulle jag skriva en filmuppsats , så skulle den heta " Hur man INTE filmatiserar böcker " , och handla exklusivt om denna filmen . Nu har Håfström , mycket tack vare denna filmen , lyckats landa Stephen King-berättelsen " 1408 " , en av hans mindre kända noveller . Jag är hyfsat säker på att " 1408 " får Håfström att hamna i samma fack som Joakim Ersgård , som regissör med C-status . Jag har stött på andra exempel på masspsykos på två andra svenska filmer . Den första var * beep * Åmål " , en tramsig travesti med riktigt ytliga och tvådimensionella karaktärer , och " Lilja 4-ever " . Den senare gillar jag för dess berättartekniska egenskaper , men filmen vilar på ett svagt manus och kass pacing . Undrar vilken nästa svensk film blir som får samma effekt ?

108062446	858056	Re : 1st horror movie	This wasn't my first horror movie back in the day , but at the same time it had the weakest plot , and for the life of me after reading the book adaption of this film , I found that the book was far , far , far more superior to the film , but I can see the budget at that time wouldn't allow it . I remember viewing this film when it got to LA back in late January 1978 , and I was about 7 at the time . . . I was excited to see this film with my twin , and I dragged my aunts to see this film , which was a double feature , or a " Grindhouse " experience , to " Which Way is Up " at the Hawthorne 6 ( which doesn't exist anymore ) and as a 7yr old . . . I was very disappointed . If a remake is ever done , I'm betting it will be far more superior and hopefully stay faithful to the book .
48577754	288756	Re : On DVD ?	> > As for the idiot who claims " He heard " Detlaff place huge watermarks on it , and its unwatchable is full of crap ! The watermark is far from huge and the image is far better than " watchable " . It amazes me that stupid people write posts like this and haven't actually seen it ! < < Actually , he's entirely correct . Originally the film was made available on VHS with a mammoth watermark blocking out a significant amount of the image . Only later , on the DVD release , were the watermarks reduced to the reasonably acceptible overlays in the corner .
48577238	288756	Re : Music	Silent films , especially at that time ( 1910 ) virtually never had " original " music . It was the job of the individual theater musician to cobble together a musical accompaniment - - appropriate or otherwise depending on his or her skill . Sometimes studios would assist by circulating a cue sheet indicating in vague general terms the mood of music that should accompany individual scenes and some music publishers like Sam Fox maintained collections of original or classical sheet music cataloged by mood especially for theater musicians . Even into the 1920s , many low-budget films weren't distributed with written scores , and when they were , those scores were often compilations of classical themes rather than original music . The score recorded for the DVD release of Frankenstein is entirely appropriate and typical of what would be done at the time , which makes it as " original " as it ever got .

112084244	288756	Re : Chaos at Scar 3D screening ! Man passes out , a viewer throws up !	William Castle did NOT wire seats with electricity for " The Tingler " .

Small vibrators were attached to some seats in first-run screenings , which produced a mild vibration on cue ( not unlike those gadgets they used to sell in comic books that you palmed when you shook hands with someone ) .
48578704	288756	Re : On DVD ?	Actually , by adding new title cards and a music score , he was entirely legal in claiming a copyright TO HIS VERSION of the movie . And that copyright will stand for fifty years after his death . Alternate versions , minus the new material , can be copyrighted by whomever makes them . The fact that the original material is in the public domain has no bearing on alterations thereof .
48576369	288756	Re : film historians . . . PLEASE HELP ME !	All current " versions " of the film come from a single surviving original , so if you've seen one , you've seen ' em all . I doubt very seriously that there was ever a " close-up " in the original , however . In 1910 , close-ups as we know them today were still quite rare and as an inovator , Edison's output was usually less advanced than most of his contemporaries . There's nothing in the film to suggest that it was ever more than the kind of standard succession of tableaux that had been filmmaking for the previous decade . As Mr . Olsen suggested , you're probably thinking of the production still of Ogle which has been around for ages rather than anything from the film itself .
48579846	288756	Re : Who's Thomas Edison ?	> > Without Thomas Alva Edison , there would not the Film Industry as we know it ( for better or worse . ) < < Maybe or maybe not . Although Edison's marketing did help to popularize movies in the US and his Great Train Robbery is rightly recognized as one of the pivotal advances in film story telling , most of his studio's output was pretty mundane . It was his competitors , particularly Biograph , sidestepping his patent restrictions to produce films independently , who actually made the most advances in the artistic style of movies . If Edison had had his way and been able to use his patents to lock out all competition the film industry might well have died aborning .

111517061	288756	Re : Height ?	I thought of this thread recently when I watched Jimmy Zip again , in which he costars with Chris Mulkey . Back in the 1980s I knew Chris when he was penciled in to costar in Bull Durham ( in the role eventually played by Tim Robbins ) . I'm 6 ' and Chris is almost exactly the same height as me . There's a couple of scenes in Jimmy Zip where Brandon is standing next to Chris , and he only comes up to his shoulder , so I'd estimate he's closer to the 5'2 " guess than 5'6 " .

And as for the message that insists " everyone " would rather see Phoebe Cates nude than Willie Aames , you would probably find quite a lot of girls ( and even a few guys ) strongly disagreeing with that !

81147610	288756	Re : Force of Impact	In any case , the film was obviously crafted so that two unessential scenes of the two guys in bed could be lifted out without affecting the story in the slightest , and bingo ! there is no other reference in the movie to them being gay lovers and not just buddys . ( It's been a long time since I've seen the film , but I believe there are also one or two lines of dialog in a single scene between Rae Don Chong and a sentry , which also could be easily elided , but absolutely nothing else . ) The folks that claim the film is riddled with gay references are simply reading things into innocuous lines that would be completely innocent if you didn't know ahead of time that the two characters were gay . You can read similar pretend-innuendo into any " buddy movie " ever made . Clearly the film was designed to be " converted " with two or three quick snips for a wider , more conservative audience .
112671109	288756	Re : Based on a true story ?	I was once talking to the director of the old film , Macon County Line . He said that during filming they began to realize that there were a number of problems with the storyline , and so to gloss over them they decided to put a title on the beginning reading " Based on a true story " although in reality it was pure fiction . After the film was released and reasonably successful , some woman in Georgia filed a lawsuit claiming that the film had been based on HER life story and demanding compensation for its use !

142277839	4547256	Re : Demi Moore's breasts	I do remember that , also . Plus , just look at them - if you have seen enough breast jobs , they are clearly fake . It was one thing about the movie that irritated me before I ever saw it . In the book it was specifically stated that she was small-breasted . To have Demi claim she needed them for this movie really depressed me . I kept wondering what else would be ruined ( from the book ) based on this kind of thinking .

148384946	4547256	Re : Zellweger . Ugly ?	Haha ! I would normally argue that Renee Zellweger is quite attractive . This is coming from a heterosexual female viewpoint ; not sure how others view her . I rented this movie for two reasons : her and the location . But , her Botox , make-up , weight loss , cosmetic surgery , or whatever ( combination ? ) it was - really distracted me throughout the entire film . She looked bad . Her face looked hard and it looked stressed . I spent most of the movie cringing and feeling sympathy for her ( watching the premier or at whatever point she saw the movie , she had to realize that she did not look very good ) . It was distracting and made what was probably an o . k . movie far less enjoyable .

162777309	4547256	Re : Bullock threatening the crack dealer was embarassing .	The thing is , though , that people do sometimes react this way and succeed . I was a very mousy looking 18 year old white girl living and working in a very tough , very non-white neighborhood . One day while at work ( little corner grocery ) a couple of twenty-something African American men started bullying me at the counter and then attempted to leave without paying for their merchandise . I know for sure the one had a gun , but he had not bothered to pull it out . I could see the shape of it under his shirt . I don't know where it came from , but I just snapped and ran around the counter at them . By the time I got done ranting and raving about things like respect and honor and blah blah blah , while physically blocking the exit to the store , they not only paid for the merchandise but apologized . And , on the way out the one made a comment to about " crazy white b*tches " while shaking his head . Five minutes later I was freaking out that I just did this . My co-worker , who made no attempt to do anything other that pretend to be invisible , came out of hiding and proceeded to tell me how entertaining it was to watch me , a 5 foot 4 inch woman go after these two guys ( one was certainly of 6 foot tall ) . Anyway , when I see scenes like in this movie or others ( Gran Torino ) , I totally believe in it .

26647449	1938156	Re : What happend after Alex's wedding ?	According to the official bugs website ( www . bugs . co . uk ) , the ending reads like this " The final scenes take place at Alex's wedding . . . After the ceremony Adam notices a mysterious guest , Stefano . Ros then sees Adam and Stefano arguing . A little later , Adam is mysteriously shot and killed . Meanwhile Ros and Beckett have been captured by Stefano . . . . " They don't elaborate as to who he is but I don't think he's the guy in the front of the car who turns to Ros and Beckett . I believe that that guy is in fact Jean-Daniel ( the balding guy who masterminded Cyberax ) , as it's mentioned somewhere that his body was never found ( although Beckett believes him to be dead ) . And Beckett's final line " I thought you were dead " , would seem to add weight to this theory . But , unfortunately , that's all it is . A theory .

45154690	5790556	Re : Fans - Jump on Board !	Absolutely ! Even though Bobby Sherman and David Soul may have gotten more publicity out of HCTB , it was obvious that Robert Brown was the real star of the show . Not to take anything away from the actors who played the younger Bolt brothers . The chemistry between the three of them was great , and I felt they were very believable as family . When I got my DVD of HCTB , it was like being reunited with old friends whom I hadn't seen in nearly forty years . From the Bolt brothers to Lottie , Captain Clancy and the brides , Big Swede and Miss Essie . It was even great to see Aaron Stemple again . Very rarely in television will you find a better cast assembled . But IMO , what held it all together , what made it work so well and made it one of the most memorable shows in television history , was Robert Brown . When he was onsceen , he made even Bo Svenson look small . His talent was that great , his presence that formidible . I do not know if the role of Jason Bolt was written specifically for Robert Brown , but it is impossible to imagine anyone else ever playing it . From his tenderness toward Miss Essie to his confidence to take on any challenge . What an acting range ! I know there have to be many , many more Robert Brown fans out there . Let's get busy , people , and let everyone know how we feel !

45405699	5790556	Steve Clark's ( Bill Randall ) Age ? ? ?	If you look up the actor Steve Clark - who played Bill Randall , Barbara Randall's Clark Kent look-alike husband in " Phantom From Space " , his IMDB data sheet says he was born in 1891 . That would have made him 62 years old when PFS was filmed ! How could that be possible ? That has to be a mistake - he looked as though he were no older than his mid-thirties in that film . It's either a mistake , or he was one of those very rare individuals who simply don't seem to age . Sadly , his IMDB data sheet also shows him having passed away in 1954 , only the year after " Phantom " . Does anyone know if these dates are correct ? I'm just rather curious . . .

144045843	5790556	Re : Perfectly good film	I love action movies . I like Jason Statham and all the " Transporter " movies . Yet I found " Crank " to be almost unwatchable . I can't say I paid much attention to the music , either . We all have our opinions , and certainly different things appeal to different people . I guess all I was saying that I found " House of the Dead " to be perfectly watchable ( maybe in a brain-dead sort of way , but still watchable ) . I have seen far , FAR worse movies than this , including most others directed by Uwe Boll ( yes , including the one with Jason Statham - what was it called ? A Dungeon Siege Tale , or something like that ? ) . So I guess you could say that HOTD is my " favorite " Uwe Boll movie . Gads ! ! ! Did I just say that ?

44893190	5790556	Re : How about some board activity for Robert Brown ?	Interesting you should mention Burt Lancaster . I remember reading ( a very long time ago ) that Robert Brown took inspiration for some aspects of the character . Jason Bolt , from the Starbuck role played by Lancaster in " The Rainmaker " . Obviously the " silver tongued devil " ( as Clancy liked to call him ) aspect , which he put to good use when trying to persuade 100 single New Bedford women to accompany him and his brothers back to the relative wilds of 1870's Seattle . I remember after reading that , I sought out and watched " The Rainmaker " . While the characters were nothing alike in many respects , the fast talking charm , confidence , and charisma , as well as the not-so-subtle ( at least in Lancaster's case ) con-man approach was evident in both performances . Of course , in Jason's case at least , all of the bluster and bravado really did hide the proverbial heart of gold . Two outstanding actors . Two outstanding talents .

136325938	5790556	Re : IMDb Title ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	I could be totally wrong , but as a kid back in the 60's , I used to collect newspaper clippings of Jerry Lewis ' films as they were released or re-released , including the ads for local theaters . I really do think that the newspaper ads for this movie caled it " Boeing ( 707 ) Boeing ( 707 ) " . I even remember going out and buying a model of a Boeing 707 because I enjoyed the film so much . ( A couple of years later , I probably would have preferred a model of Christiane Schmidtmer - or better yet , the real thing ! ! ! ) .
64912588	5790556	Re : Talk w / Don Sullivan . . . finally !	What a rare and unique priviledge it must have been to sit down and talk with Don about his life and career . That is something I have wished for many years that I could do myself . I do so hope that you will be posting the interview ( or excerpts from it ) very , very soon here at IMDB . Please also keep us posted on your efforts to get the full interview published , as I'm dying to read it . I'd probably buy up at least a dozen copies as keepsakes ! As far as fan reponse to Don possibly appearing at film shows or conventions , I for one would not hesitate to travel anywhere in the USA , or even overseas , for the opportunity to meet and possibly talk with Don . THAT would truly be a major highlight of my life ! Of all the film actors of the 50's and early 60's , he was hands down The Man . He brought a life and an enthusiasm to his movies that few other actors could , and his handful of films are , without a doubt , my very favorites of that era . You Rule , Don !
47306478	5790556	Don as Chase Winstead	Don was like my boyhood hero watching him in the few leading roles that he had . I mean , after all - who besides Chase Winstead would be cool enough to hold a full-time job as a top mechanic , study engineering at night , and in his spare time take care of his mother and little crippled sister , pal around with the local sheriff , build and race hot rods , write and perform rock-n-roll songs , be an explosives expert , have a zoology library , stand up to Old Man Wheeler , do his part to keep drunk drivers off the road , battle giant monsters , AND romance the local French girl . . . ? The guy was just too cool ! He was like the Buckaroo Banzai of his generation . And he was a real person too , because despite all his accomplishments , the poor guy barely had two nickels to rub together . A true working class hero . Seriously , I would love to know whatever became of Don . It seems as though he dropped off the face of the planet . Don - if you're out there , please know you have many , many fans who would love to hear from you ! Your movies were few , but were some of the most memorable and cherished moments from the 50's . You were indeed The Man . . .
65006281	5790556	Re : Talk w / Don Sullivan . . . finally !	Thanks for the clarification . Next best alternative to be sure ! Perhaps someday we will indeed get the chance to meet with Don personally . . . This easily is STILL the most exciting news I've heard in years , and I'm so looking forward to reading the excepts from your interview with him . Keep us posted , and thank you for all your efforts to help bring Don in touch with his fans once again !
63763736	5790556	Re : DON SULLIVAN TODAY	Please let everyone know if you actually locate Don . I would love to write him to let him know of all the good times and great enjoyment his films give his many fans ! I hope that maybe he even comes on IMDB from time to time , and already knows this from reading the boards . . . You are the MAN , Don !
151759081	5790556	Re : Does anyone know where I can get the Phantasm 3 end theme ?	I have to admit I'm a bit surprised . I've watched Phantasm 2 and 3 numerous times , and never noticed any differences between the end credit themes . I just always assumed they used the same AWESOME music from number 2 for the end crdits for number 3 . Guess that goes to show I'm not paying as much attention as I thought I was . . .
56458567	5790556	Re : goofiest monsters	Oh yeah - the monsters from HOPB were great , as was the movie itself . A Del Tenney classic ! And let's not forget the creatures from " The Green Slime " . And of course the giant Big Bird look-alike ( except black-and-white , not yellow ) from " The Giant Claw " ( which was already mentioned ) . This list could go on for a long , long time . . .

119237865	5790556	Re : Daily driver ' 71 Cuda	I had read ( and I believe they say it somewhere on the DVD commentary or extra features ) that the ' Cuda in the first Phantasm was actually a 340 CID with a leaky sunroof . If that's the case , they re-badged it for the close-up where Mike pops the hood , as it quite clearly states that it's a 440 6-pack . For this reason , I firmly believe that the " hemicuda " ( which I'd also heard was re-badged ) in Phantasm II , was never intended to be regarded as the same car from the first film . It didn't have the sunroof , and of course , the hood badging was different . I always just assumed that Reggie had a black ' Cuda hemi , similar in appearance to Jody's 440 6-pack . Of course it is destroyed two-thirds of the way through the movie in a fiery rollover crash . The hemicuda convertible in Phantasm III and IV was a true hemi , and a 1970 , I believe , as opposed to the 71's from the first two films . I believe Don Coscarelli kept this sweet ride as his own . Obviously , the man had a thing for ' Cudas . It's always bugged me ( and it bugs me equally that I can't remember which film it was ) , that Reggie ( again ) states in Phantasm III or IV , that Jody died in a car wreck . They then proceed to show the wreck from Phantasm II , with a close-up of Jody behind the wheel . Of course , I can't fault them for not wanting to wreck any more of those babies than they had to . . . Speaking of which , has anyone ever been annoyed by the " official " diecast Phantasm ' 71 ' Cuda from Ertl ? States right on the box it's a 340 CID , has no sunroof , and a WHITE interior . Don't get me wrong - I proudly own one myself , but they didn't even come close to getting it right ! Anyway , love the movies , love the cars . Would LOVE to see Phantasm V , but it's not looking good .
51525980	5790556	Re : Greetings	Hello Kent , I only recently found this thread that you started to keep in touch with your many fans . I think it's great that you take the time to do this . You're always honest and upfront with your responses - frequently very funny , but occasionally a bit down , depending on how things are going for you at the the time . Believe me , we all have our ups and downs . Just know that are a whole bunch of us out here pulling for you and wishing you well . Oddly enough , when I'm feeling a bit down and unappreciated , I will very often put on my WELL worn videotape of NO RETREAT , NO SURRENDER . The message it conveys is just as relevant to me today as it was twenty years ago . And you were no small part of helping get that message across , my friend . You were a part of something very special to a great many people , and we still think of you and that film in a very special way . So hang in there . Keep those dreams alive and keep working toward achieving all that and more . Your fans believe in you and are behind you all the way . As a wise young man named R . J . once said . . . . . " No Retreat , No Surrender " ! ! ! Best wishes , Richard

I can't recall if I had seen either of his two " Superman " serials at that time ( though I certainly have since ) , but was certainly aware of them and his legendary status as the first screen Superman . I was deeply saddened at his passing in 1999 . Thank you , Kirk . You've left your fans a lasting legacy with your wonderful work , and your memorable convention appearances .

46031808	5790556	Re : Questions	Hi Jack . I just wanted to add my opinion of the ' 76 Kong remake compared to the ' 05 Peter Jackson " extravaganza " . More often than not , I will judge a movie based primarily on its entertainment value . In that regard , the ' 05 version simply does not cut it . I can't remember the last time a movie I had such high hopes for let me down so much . While being quite stunning technically , it's simply way too long and contains some ridiculous scenes which really add nothing to the storyline ( the dinosaur stampede , for one ) . And while the ' 05 version made a much closer examination of the growing relationship between Ann and Kong than did the ' 33 original , as well as eliciting great sympathy for Kong , the simple fact is that the ' 76 remake did those same things 29 years earlier . In my opinion , for sheer entertainment value , the ' 76 version beats the ' 05 version hands down . Sure , in your version Kong was just a guy in a gorilla suit . But as there was no such thing as CGI back then , the only choices were that or stop-motion . And stop motion never lent itself well to " humanizing " its subjects , if you will . Besides , it was Rick Baker in the gorilla suit , and no one has ever done gorilla suits better than Rick Baker . And did the ' 76 Kong look like a real gorilla ? Not really , but then neither did Kong in the ' 33 original . I own all three films on tape or DVD . I have watched the'33 and ' 76 versions countless times . I have watched the ' 05 version once , and that will probably be enough . BTW , you had some great scenes in Kong ' 76 , my favorite probably being when you carried Jessica Lange to the cabin , and requested privacy so she could be undressed and examined . Hilarious stuff , and just one of the many moments that helped make the ' 76 Kong a modern day classic ! Thanks for all the great performances . . .
157182250	5790556	Re : 10 reasons why Howling is better than AWIL	I think both movies are great , though I believe American Werewolf withstands the test of time a bit better . The Howling had numerous pop culture references and inside jokes which were great at the time , but may be lost on an audience of today . American Werewolf is more of a traditional horror movie which just happens to be funny . And most of the humor is derived from ordinary people being thrown into an utterly fantastic situation . I also base my opinion on the repeated viewing aspect of each film , as over the years , I have watched American Werewolf many times more than The Howling . As for each film's signature transformation scene , I've never been able to decide . They're both totally jaw-dropping , even by ( some might say ESPECIALLY by ) today's standards . I have always liked the final four-legged werewolf incarnation in AAWIL better - maybe because as one reviewer wrote back in the day , The Howling werewolves look a lot like Wile E . Coyote . . . They're both modern classics , but my personal perference will always lie with Amercian Werewolf .

78502150	5790556	Re : goofiest monsters	I'm not sure that they ever showed Reptilicus fly in the flick , but it definitely had some stupid looking little wings . Which , if it didn't fly in the movie , made even less sense that it had them ! Wasn't there a " Reptilicus " comic series back in the 60's ? Or maybe it was called " Reptisaurus " . Either way , it had wings and it did fly . . . The Manster was really scary to me as a little kid , until years later I realized the extra head resembled a carved coconut ! But that eye on the shoulder . . . YIKES ! Revision : 07 / 03 / 07 http en wikipedia org wiki Reptilicus After typing in " Reptilicus " and going to Wikipedia , I found out that in the original uncut Danish version , the creature did fly . Also found out that Reptilicus was a short-lived comic that evolved into the almost equally short-lived Reptisaurus comic I seem to have this vague recollection of .
151824796	5790556	Re : Team Up With Ash ?	I believe Lionel's mother's headstone at her funeral read 1897-1957 , so yes it was set in the ' 50's .

136397344	5790556	Re : Why did Clark start a fight ?	That part didn't bother me so much - I figured Clark was merely being ultra-protective of Lois , and was defending her honor . What always HAS bothered me a lot is near the end of the movie , after regaining his superpowers , he goes back to the diner , and goads the trucker into another " fight " , knowing all the while he'll mop the floor with the guy without blinking an eye . Maybe it was to teach the bully a lesson , but this " revenge " scene , while a crowd-pleaser , always seemed very out of character for Clark / Superman . I just thought that Kal-El , Last Son of Krypton , should be above such petty things as revenge and showing off .

103780778	5790556	Re : Perfectly good film	I have to at least partially agree . I found this film perfectly watchable , and enjoyed it enough to purchase the DVD . Granted , it was a previously viewed DVD from Blockbuster , but I still bought it ! I thought it was a fun , action-packed zombie movie . I'll admit the video game sequences intercut with the film took a bit of getting used to , but all in all , I enjoyed it . In fact , the movie sort of reawakened my interest in zombie flicks . If you want to see some REALLY bad movies , I recently purchased the Mill Creek Entertainment Horror 250 pack collection . It contains many great old public domain horror flicks , as well as some really painfully bad , almost unwatchable ones . But I love ' em nonetheless !
46080728	5790556	Re : Questions	Hello Jack , Thank you for the kind reply to my post . Of course I neglected to mention the 40 foot tall mechanical Kong , briefly seen in full in the big stadium sequence , and in close-up hand shots as well . Impressive indeed for its day , though it pretty obviously couldn't have been used for the intense action sequences . That's when Rick Baker took over , and turned in what I still think was an outstanding performance . Any idea whatever happened to the giant mechanical Kong ? Was it dismantled ? Is it on some studio backlot somewhere ? Did it turn up years later on Ebay ? ( just kidding . . . ) Speaking of outstanding performances , yours was certainly one of the most memorable from Kong ' 76 , not to mention Superman I and II . Non was such a great character . I can't imagine anyone having played him but you . I have thoroughly enjoyed everything of yours I have seen , and I hope to see you back on the big screen again one of these days . Good health and best wishes to you always . Richard
95597285	5790556	Re : I liked this guy	I saw TFOS in the movies with my brother when I was about 6 years old . What great memories I have of it !

So much fun , both in 1959 and now ( I think I watched it for the umpteenth time again only last week ) .

151899308	5790556	IMDB Ratings Game	Here's a stupid little game I guess I've been playing subconsciously for some time , though it only just clicked in my head what I'm doing . Very seldom will I look a movie up on IMDB prior to watching it , as I like to go into a film with no preconceived notions . After I've seen it , I'll usually look it up on IMDB to see its rating , read the reviews , and read some of the discussion boards . Usually when I first look a movie up here , I'll have some sort of personal mental rating already in my head from my having just viewed it . Sometimes , my personal rating is very close , occasionally within a couple of percentage points . Other times my personal rating will be on almost the opposite end of the ratings spectrum from the average of other IMDB voters . I guess I only just realized what I had been doing when I looked up BIG BAD WOLF here after watching it last night . My personal rating was a 5 . 4 - okay flick , just slightly above average in my book . Well I was surprised when I found the IMDB rating also to be 5 . 4 , exactly what I had mentally rated it . I'm not sure , but that might be the first time I ever hit it square on the head ! That's when I think I realized what I had been doing subconsciously all this time . Of course , I realize the IMDB rating could change slightly even overnight . I haven't cast my vote yet , and of course you can't vote in percentage points . I haven't decided yet if I'll round down to a 5 or round up to a 6 . Not really worth writing about , I guess , but worth a quick smile of satisfaction on my part , that I was able to peg it exactly . I know - I must lead an extraordinarily boring life . . .

37406664	5790556	Re : Don Sullivan is NOT Scotty Beckett	I absolutely have to agree with tdinan on this matter . I have been a long time fan of Don Sullivan ( though admittedly , I know as little about his personal or later life as anyone else ) . I have watched " The Giant Gila Monster " countless times , as I consider it to be pretty much the quintessential low-budget teenage / hot-rod / rock'n roll / horror flick , and Don Sullivan appeared to be being groomed as the next teenage idol in that one ( in a local made-in-Texas indie film sort of way ! } Several of his other films have spent a good deal of time in my DVD or VHS player , those being " Teenage Zombies " ( laughably lame , but prime shlock ) , and " Monster of Piedras Blancas " ( a nifty minor horror classic ) . That being said , I have also watched some things with Scotty Beckett in them , most notably , several " Rocky Jones " adventures , and while there is a definite similarity between Don Sulllivan and Scotty Beckett , they simply are NOT the same actor ! Sullivan's eyes and eyebrows are different , his nose is slightly smaller and his ears appear slightly larger than Beckett's . And no matter what anyone says , their voices are not that similar . But the most telling characteristic is Don Sullivan's expressions and mannerisms are totally different to those of Scotty Beckett . He has a much broader smile than Scotty Beckett , and never once in any of his films did I see him smirk like Scotty Beckett , something Beckett did almost constantly in the " Rocky Jones " adventures . So - sorry to all you believers in this rumour , but let's give each man and artist the respect he deserves . We all know Scotty Beckett's story and its sad ending . Let's hope Don's has been a happier one . Either way , kudos to two fine actors , and many thanks for the joy they've given their fans .

47156653	5790556	Sanita Pelkey	I bought this flick on DVD when it came out last year just for Sanita Pelkey , who played " Amelia " , the tall , incredibly hot chick with the bookworm glasses . A real stunner - enough to make any red-blooded American boy want to take up drag racing . . .
65392996	5790556	Re : Don Sullivan Pt . 1	I can't wait to read more from your interview with Don . Just the couple of quotes above I found really fascinating . It's amazing to think that this actor whom I've admired for decades , and who has had such a profound influence on my life , has chosen this time to reconnect with his fans . I can't even begin to describe how huge this is for me personally . I do so hope that Don decides to make an appearance at some upcoming show or convention . The opportunity to meet him and talk with him would be like the ultimate thrill for me !

144044293	5790556	Re : Christian fundamentalist , anti-science PROPAGANDA !	I'm sorry - I know this thread is old , but I've just got to say that the OP's observations are the most retarded thing I've ever read . . . To accuse THIS of ALL movies to be religious propaganda is just too funny ! Of course , looking down the list of Killswitch's other posts , it seems that at least half of them deal with similar themes . I couldn't be bothered actually reading any of them , as I'm sure they must be just as enlightening as his post on this board . . .
105810803	5790556	Re : Deja Vu . . .	OK - the sporting goods store scene was at least halfway original , though a bit reminiscent of the night club scene in Fright Night . And Evil Ed - oh , the other kid , just got bitten . Ha !
44600637	5790556	Re : Anybody out there who knows what has happened to Robert Brown ?	I can't believe there isn't any IMDB Board activity for this amazing actor , especially since HCTB has just been released on DVD . I remember watching the show during its initial run in the late 60's , and Robert Brown had such a commanding screen presence , that his character of Jason Bolt was almost larger than life . Few actors of any caliber can do that . To this day , I cannot understand how he failed to become an enormous star . He took the role of Jason Bolt , and totally made it his own . No one else could have played that part . Though according to IMDB , very little seems to be known of Mr . Brown these days , the last I heard he was alive and well , and enjoying his retirement . I hope the same holds true today as when I read this on the net several years back . Thank you , Robert , for the joy you've given your many fans all of these years , and may God Bless you .
155577111	5790556	Re : Eegah ' s finest hour . . .	I know it's a bit scary to think about , but in my copy of this movie , when the camera is focused on Eegah's face while he's feeling up the girl , all hot and heavy , his face contorts for a moment and his huge body makes a slight jerking motion - almost as though he'd climaxed in his ' skin tunic . The girl then proceeds to coo . . . " oh , Eegah . . . ! Surely that's not what they were suggesting happened . Wouldn't that be a bit too racy for the early ' 60's ?

144117446	5790556	Re : Total Ripoff of Fright Night	I have to disagree about Fright Night being a blatant rip-off of Rear Window . Sure there was a definite common element in that Charlie in Fright Night and Jeff ( the James Stewart character ) in Rear Window are both spying on their neighbors through the window . But Jeff was incapacitated with a broken leg , and out of boredom had been spying on his neighbors for weeks . Charlie was leading a perfectly normal teenage boy's life ( trying his best to get into his girlfriend's pants ) , when he just accidentally spotted his neighbor's coffin being carried in next door . Who WOULDN'T start spying on their neighbor if you watched them carry a coffin into their house ? Other than the spying on your neighbor aspect , the plots of the two films are nothing alike . I had already long been a fan of Rear Window when I first saw Fright Night . At no time while watching Fright Night did I ever think " this is nothing but a total rip-off of Rear Window " . That being said , Never Cry Werewolf is indeed a rip-off of Fright Night . The first half of the movie parallels Fright Night almost scene-for-scene , and character-for-character . The second half does start to stray abit from the FN formula , but - Wow . I would never DARE knowingly write something so similar to another established work . All that aside , I still found Never Cry Werewolf to be entertaining and amusing in its own right . It's just I'd be afraid to put MY name to the script , for fear of being sued . . .
47156181	5790556	Amazing Beauty . . .	Just wanted to say the beauty and charm that Sanita Pelkey displayed in her all too few screen appearances never failed to stun me . I thought she was especially awesome in " Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow " with the bookworm glasses and killer Everything Else . When I first saw that flick on the late show many years ago , my only thought was , " Who IS that girl ? ! ? Her performance with the all girl trio , her presence at the pajama party , and her costume and dancing at the " Haunted House " party near the end of the film just all blow me away . I'd had a crappy VHS broadcast copy for many years , and was really tickled when it came out on DVD ( part of a double feature ) last year . Sanita was something to behold . Such a shame that she passed away at such an early age . We miss you , Sanita . May you Rest in Peace . . .
152976282	5790556	Re : Lily , Lily , Lily . . .	I can't explain why , but for some reason I found Lily Tomlin to be incredibly sexy in this movie . I'd never really thought that about her prior to seeing this , but she simply lit up the screen in All of Me . . .

I was already a fan for life , but meeting you only reinforced that . Following the convention , you and Brian traveled to the Keys where I lived , and before leaving , you gave me a call on the phone . Quite a thrill , I must say ! It's wonderful to see you back on television here in the states in The Sarah Jane Adventures . I'm so looking forward to seeing the entire series , as well as all of your future endeavors .

144453280	5790556	Re : Jennifer Ellison's foul language	I find it hard to believe that a discussion on foul language in a movie has somehow turned into a political debate , basically leading to name-calling over who lives in the " better " country .

153188780	635556	Re : How did this beat Saving Private Ryan for the Oscar ?	In showing Shakespeare and his crew as the inventors of modern showbiz , it made the connection between high art , Elizabethan theatre and modern day movie-making . Very flattering . Now who votes for the Oscars ? It's a much better film than SPR and La Vita . The Thin Red Line , perhaps . But why shouldn't a smart comedy win every now and then ? Fully deserved .

134417010	635556	Re : How did this beat Saving Private Ryan for the Oscar ?	See if you learnt history you wouldn't come across as such a fool ! There was a real Private Ryan , you know . And like the rest of the surviving 82nd and 101st Airborne , he didn't sit on his arse in the fields for three days . He discovered the fact that two of his brothers had been killed on D-Day entirely on his own when he went to look for them . In other words , three days after the invasion he discovered the location and fate of two Private Ryans , all by himself in less than a day . The third died in the Pacific theatre . After his mother received all three telegrams on the same day an army chaplain was asked to find Ryan so he could return home , a task which took him less than two hours . Spielberg's story is based on an American Civil War incident . Back then it might have taken even me longer than two hours . The Allies in Normandy were better equipped . Learn some history yourself . Veterans endorse and appear in Band of Brothers . Point me at some who'll stand up for what follows the invasion sequence in SPR . That'll be tougher . My father built the engines for Typhoons . Even so , I'd've been happy ( ish ) to forgive him sticking USAAF stickers on an RAF operation if the only other mention of the Brits in the film wasn't a sneer at Monty . If you had seen or understood SIL you'd know it was full of intentional and extremely funny anachronisms .

150686597	635556	Re : Far from the Madding Crowd	Err . Changed my mind after the preview . Slightly unwise adaptation with slightly unwise media and featuring a slightly unwisely chosen cast . You need more than a few video cameras to take a performance out of the theatre and stick it on the screen . The only thing that ever came close , I think , was Bergman's Magic Flute , which maintained the theatricality with shots of the audience , excursions backstage and a lot of tweaking .
164139718	635556	Re : The Israeli Commandos Were Shot At First	The Israelis were defending themselves .

It's purely defensive .
161740997	635556	Re : superb directing and screenwriting - did you notice . . .	Also , I think it's a nice way of foreshadowing , because Knightley will be the only one ( apart from Emma herself ) who knows the whole story , won't he ? A very good point . Knightley is the authoritative voice of Highbury . I couldn't help laughing out loud when one of the posters in that thread said " Jane Austen would never do anything like this " referring to the intro when all the novels do exactly that and most of what you hear , in the very few minutes before the credits roll , is hooked straight from the book . I think the trend for starting without an intro is quite recent . P95 and P & P95 both dramatised the essential content from the intro but voiceovers were pretty much the norm before . Jane Eyre 44 starts with rostrum camera shots of pages of the book !
128839850	635556	Re : Mystery or Love story ?	It is a love story but isn't reputed as one because Anna was too good to have thrown herself away on Lime and is much too good for drunken , incompetent Holly Martins , who in all likelihood does not have a bright future ahead of him . Calloway spots this and never warms to him . He is smart enough to see Anna's value but not smart enough to work out how to make himself attractive to her . A siituation that is depressingly familiar to most of us but , sadly , escapism is off the menu in post-war Vienna . It's not a great fit into any genre which is one of the reasons it disappoints lots of people , I think . If you look at some of the negative threads , you'll see people complaining about the lack of action , the obvious twist , the boring pacing ( never understood that one ) and so on . It's often because the film has overlapped with other genre films they do like and fallen short of fitting the category . Looking for things that aren't there , in other words , instead of admirting what is .
163374958	635556	Re : So , I've finally seen the whole series	The ' 72 series should carry a Government Health Warning .

Apart from that and the fact it has nothing whatsoever in common with Queen Christina , it's almost a carbon copy .

166580992	635556	Re : Negative views of Patton .	Ike ran the show and kept his eyes on the prize and his hands on the wheel . Montgomery was happy to manipulate politcians and subordinates and military advisors and consultants who didn't have his vision but he did not monkey with Ike . Bradley , Ike and Montgomery made a team that was significantly larger than the sum of its parts , perfect for the one overriding and all consuming objective in 1944 , landing in Normandy and pushing the Germans out of France . The Allied staff work fell to bits once the objective had been achieved so there were no other great successes to compare with the Battle of Normandy . But Ike ran the show and you can no more call him a politician or an ambassador than you can call Haig an ambassador in WW1 . Before Goodwood , beneath the last line of one of Montgomery's blue sky plans for the politicians to simultaneously reduce casualties and increase progress , written purely to keep them quiet , Bradley wrote the single word " Pattonesque " .
164260560	635556	I'll give you five reasons ( there are , of course , more )	You'll be highly offended by all of them . But you did ask and they're the reasons , whether you like them or not . 1 . Because there aren't a lot of zealots with extreme tunnel vision running around defending everything North Korea does . 2 . Because , to hide their culpability , Israel illegally confined journalists covering the event , stripped and searched them and stole everything they owned capable of storing an electronic image . Then stole some of the material to concoct an entirely ridiculous version of events which they propagated while both journalists they stole it from and anyone else who could contradict them was held incommunicado . 3 . Because people who realise that the North Korean action is a casus belli cannot see that the Israeli action is in the same category . 4 . Because Israel has become precisely the sort of rogue state that North Korea is , untouchable by international law , treaty or resolution at least partly because it feels it has the total and undiscriminating support of the USA . 5 . Because Israel is at the core of political instability in the most unstable part of the world and its current government is pursuing policies which daily make things worse . Actually the overriding reason is that reasonable people , you will find , do not agree with Jack Bauer that everything in the catalogue of military action is legitimate when you feel threatened . This entire operation was illegal . In fact it breached almost every aspect of international law regarding maritime inspection . The world will eventually call time on Israel's rogue state behaviour . It is , for the moment however , still mustering its courage .

The North Vietnamese came to the negotiating table to buy time and to run rings round the American PR crews , ratcheting up the international pressure on a nation that was no longer interested in the fight . The B52's did a bang-up job of killing a couple of million civilians from the former Indo-China , but never scored a tactical or strategic victory . And the B-36 wasn't anybody's war winner . It could only ever be a war winner if it had exclusive use of A-bombs , which isn't going to happen . Granted that no one in Britain was willingly going to put their shoulders to the Nazi wheel in the new Britain but in my idealised , child-friendly New Anglo-Nazi Europe , our boots are shinier , our economy is growing more quickly and diversifying more rapidly , our technology is in every way superior , our foreign policy is purposeful and assured and for a solid 20 years at least we outperform the US right across the board . In fact , we're quite popular in the USA , who like our Leica SLRs , Mercedes Benzes and Jaguars , jet airliners and working washing machines ( the US still hasn't got around to those ) . Of course it all goes horribly wrong when Kraftwerk release their first album .

97117704	635556	Re : Capote or Infamous ?	If you look at Hoffman in The Talented Mr Ripley , you can clearly see the Hoffman of Capote . It's the same actor and his acting is an assembly of techniques which , while admirable , is nontheless visible as the art of an actor who delivers from a highly polished but narrow range of ability . If you look at Toby Jones as Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop , you will not recognise him as the same person playing Capote in Infamous . I checked before posting this because I still find it hard to believe . He simply IS Capote and his performance takes you past acting into the real world of Manhattan Intellectuals and clashing American cultures with Capote as a much more beliveable witness , though paradoxically ( and intentionally ) much more unreliable . For me , Jones ' performance is not only better , but in a different league .

118635439	635556	Re : Is Lady Ludlow's son gay ? ? ?	You couldn't be more wrong . Overt homosexual behaviour was treated more harshly in Britain than elsewhere in Europe in Victorian times but no male could go through the British Public School system ( actually private boarding schools ) without without becoming aware of it and there were lots of famous same sex Victorian relationships and very few prosecutions . Wilde took his own affairs into court , seeking to prosecute the Marquis of Queensbury for libel , inadvertently introducing enough public evidence for a criminal prosecution . Even then , after the libel trial finished , he was given the opportunity to flee abroad but chose not to take it . As a prolific writer and keen student of human nature , Gaskell would have known exactly what homosexual relationships between men were about and where they went to enjoy them without harassment . The effete and expensive lifestyle of Ludlow Junior fits the picture , explaining both his permanent absence and the certainty of his not producing an heir ( when no other reason is offered ) . But don't take my word for Victorian attitudes . Jeremy Bentham , one of the greatest liberal reformers of the late 18C and 19C published an article intending to start a campaign for reform of the law in 1785 , It's reproduced here . http www columbia edu cu lweb eresources exhibitions sw25 bentham in dex . html

Mary's presentation of the avant garde is the new world which has finally arrived . You can see what sort of future Poliakoff would like from his b & w inserts of horse-faced debs .

They don't know what ' cliché ' means , have no understanding of what is encompassed by the term ' genre ' or why or how disbelief can be suspended to engage and participate in drama . They are immune to satire and any kind of sophisticated humour , all of which passes harmlessly over their heads as nature intended and they clearly don't understand much about life , fate , coincidence , culture and tradition . They're like two crows picking on the skeletons of road-kill in an empty landscape . I doubt they even read each other's posts and I'm sure no one else does . And worst of all , instead of filling up a harmless romcom board with their nonsense , they're doing it here , causing threads about one of the cinema's greatest achievements to be pruned by their tedious , ignorant prolixity . When a mod comes along to delete this , please , take the whole sorry thread with it .

158126665	635556	Re : Favourite moments / quotes	I just cannot imagine Emma Woodhouse ( pre-Frank Churchill ) doing that . This is the big difference between this adaptation and all the other Austen adaptations . Austen gives us a heroine that we do not like at first and then fall in love with gradually as her future husband does . It's a big risk . When Austen said that she has written a heroine that no one might like , she was describing this risk , not suggesting that Emma was unlikeable . I think you can see clearly what I mean in two beautifully built adjacent scenes Episode 1 . 1 . Knightly and Mrs Weston discuss Emma's vices and virtues , clearly a familiar subject . Brilliant acting as you can see Knightly's more than casual interest , the fact that Mrs Weston is unaware of it , Knightly's need to keep it under control all masked by an overriding concern for the welfare of someone who isn't achieving their potential . However Mrs Weston's side of the argument is the sympathetic one . Emma is hard done by and not complaining much . 2 . Cut to Emma and Harriet crossing the square . This is a brilliant jump . Having been led to see things from Mrs Weston's POV we instantly have Knightly's forced upon us . In a 75 yard walk , Emma is rude to Martin , haughty and dismissive , superior , interfering , selfish with Harriet , supercilious with Miss Bates , vindictive about Jane Fairfax . But before she is out of the square , although after you've had the urge to slap her , there is an intersting redemptive glimpse of reflective intelligence in her assessment of her siituation relative to Frank and Jane's . This confirms more or less everything Knightly has said of her character in the previous scene aside from her supposed lack of vanity . 30 seconds later , however , we get an excellent discourse on vanity as Elton comes into shot on his horse and Emma , unconsciously , displays a complete immunity to flattery . It's really very smart . And the score , which I failed to notice first time through , is very smartly fitted to the action . A hugely long-winded way of saying , in reply , that I think Emma would definitely be capable of the odd exasperated expression . There's another brilliant one following her father's reaction to the portrait .
130891176	635556	Re : Inaccurate ending	That's not how it works now though , is it ? What happens now is that you get a daytime TV show on which Holocaust denier and a survivor or a historian get the same amount of airtime and debate whether the Holocaust took place . And people with no historical knowledge or interest watch and assume there is some sort of equivalence between the weight of evidence on both sides . And then instead of historical fact , the Holocaust becomes a pseudo-legitimate source of debate because people out there are debating it and taking sides . This is how we end up with Intelligent Design taught in schools and vaccine boycotts . Never mind the fact that there is zero integrity on one side of the argument , those hours have got to be filled somehow and hysterical polemic gets the job done . When Austria first decided to make Holocaust Denial a crime I felt a liberal's inward twinge of disgust at the assault on free speech , along with a lot of other people . Having since heard from a lot more Holocaust deniers , I'm now in favour of stringing them all up . Well , not really but my attitude has completely changed . Holocaust denial is deranged lunacy not rational debate . And it's highly offensive to the surviving primary sufferers and the descendants of those who were its victims .

166459016	635556	Re : Was I the only one that found this film to be terrible ?	You just need to cool it a bit , laserwolf , and not treat criticism of your arguments as if it is criticism of yourself . Spirited Away is a masterpiece , i . e . possibly the best work produced by one of film's genius auteurs . It's going to have intelligent and articulate defenders and you will be able to appreciate what they see in it , even if it doesn't appeal to you , as long as you don't indulge in internet hyperbole like " Wow , I'm not even going to waste my breath etc , etc . " This is much more like the Orwell's Animal Farm than Toy Story or the Dark Knight ( both of which I like ) . Miyazaki has a lot of big things to say about what he sees happening to Japanese society and it is the soul of Japan itself which is being Spirited Away . This has not , rather tragically , been understood by the company which dubbed the film's soundtrack . The American voices are lethal to the film's purpose and if this is how you watched it , I strongly recommend you give it a second chance with the original soundtrack and sub-titles . Whilst I do like many films with disconnected subplots and fractured plotlines , Miyazaki is a very , very good storyteller and this isn't one of those films .

120087656	635556	Re : Alfa	What's interesting is that it's already apparent that Alec may be taking things a little more seriously : even if he's not interested in marriage at this stage , he does ask her that , even if she won't stay with him , she should let him know if she does turn out to be pregnant , and he will help her . That's quite a revealing bit of analysis . You think this shows interest or consideration ? Tess's pregnancy is clearly on both their minds . Hardy hints heavily that Tess already knows and Alec may have been smart enough to notice . After she refuses to be set up as a convenience , he doesn't say " if you get pregnant I will help you " , he says " if you get pregnant I will send you money " . It's the standard , utterly callous fob-off of the wealthy gigolo . He's finished with the dalliance , earlier than he'd wished , but he's finished and off to metropolitan pleasures in the hope of something better . " One would think you were a princess from your manner , in addition to a true and original d'Urberville - - ha ! ha ! Well , Tess , dear , I can say no more . I suppose I am a bad fellow - - a damn bad fellow . I was born bad , and I have lived bad , and I shall die bad in all probability . But , upon my lost soul , I won't be bad towards you again , Tess . And if certain circumstances should arise - - you understand - - in which you are in the least need , the least difficulty , send me one line , and you shall have by return whatever you require . I may not be at Trantridge - - I am going to London for a time - - I can't stand the old woman . But all letters will be forwarded . " I think it more likely that Tess is running away from the issues of being pregnant at Trantridge than Hardy left a few textual references to the magazine version containing the mock marriage ( which was censored and did not appear in print ) . And there were enough ' tricks ' on the night of The Chase without needing nay from an earlier version . We do see , from earlier drafts , how Hardy's mind was working though . A ) Can't get Tess in bed so fakes a marriage ceremony B ) Can't get Tess in bed so drugs her and takes her by force C ) Can't get Tess in bed so carts her off into the forest against her will and has her there I don't think I'd like to see my daughter anywhere near him .

There appears to be almost no breach of international law , treaty or resolution which supporters of the current Israeli government do not think is entirely defensible for reasons which are increasingly only understood by and amongst themselves . Israel needs to learn , as South Africa did , that the world's opposition to the way it conducts itself has consequences . Only by boycotting Israeli goods and services , cutting them off from international commercial and sporting competition and isolating them , much in the way they currently seek to isolate the Palestinians , can they be brought to the table to address a solution .

160248570	635556	Re : uni	It seems to me that Hardy is condemning society and it's views . To society it doesn't matter whether she was raped or was willing , it's still her fault , and she is now ' fallen ' , ' broken ' . You see similar attitudes now , when women late at night are raped , and it's their fault because they put themself in that position , or they ' lead someone on ' by wearing skimpy clothing . Just flicking through this thread again ( years later ! ! ) and I think you've hit the key issue here . Those who are not already blind can coerce themselves into blindness to transfer or equalise the blame in the crime of rape . I read the oft-quoted Sutherland article last year and it is a classic piece of purblind equivocation , ironically caused by the attitudes that Hardy set out to challenge . You have to listen and keep the big picture in focus .

164267662	635556	Re : I'll give you five reasons ( there are , of course , more )	There are two things you should understand about international law . One is that it is law and two is that it is international . Israel does not have an opt out and just because no one is putting people in the dock for war crimes now doesn't mean it will never happen . It took years to get Milosovic in the dock . The PSI does not give Israel carte blanche ot act outside international law and use inappropriate force to carry out inspections . You agreed to this . Have you changed your mind again ? Put the Israeli soldiers , or preferably their bosses , in the dock , and I will be delighgted to use due process to prove that the killings on baord the Mava Mara were illegal . You might want to look at this sentence again . " They can declare war , or impose sanctions , but there is no legal action a nation can impose on another nation without them agreeing to it . " It has a flaw in it .

156215327	635556	Re : Do Americans really not have passports ?	My point is that it has far less to with distance than it does with the other variables in the equation , like available time and motivation . Most Europeans have 5-6 weeks vacation a year . In France it used to be typical to have the whole of August off and at least one other break , usually in the winter , usually for skiing . I lived in Paris in the 80's and this was everybody's lifestyle directors , managers , juniors , secretaries , cleaners - well perhaps not so many skiing holidays for cleaners . The fact that travel broadens the mind , the world is worth seeing and you can only see it properly when you are young became givens in Europe in the 80's . In the 70's I took a gap year in between school and university and hitchiked round Europe on the proceeds of a job on the buses in Liverpool . This was very unusual back then . Now , with buckets seats on the internet available from anywhere to anywhere , it has become commonplace . I have a daughter and a son and four nephews and nieces , all under the age of 22 and only the youngest has yet to take himself , under his own steam , out of the northern hemisphere . Two have circumnavigated . The funding for most of the trips is sponsored by parents , but only in so far as kids are allowed to live at home free while they get their hands dirty in menial jobs , stacking all the cash they make into their travel funds . And when travelling they use the cheapest possible transport and stay in cheap hostels which have been built to accommodate them justabout anywhere they want to go . Back in the 70's , it's true that the Americans you met travelling all had wealthy Democrats amongst their near relations but not any more . There are fewer of them % wise possibly because a lot of American students would still rather have a masters than a world tour ( european students want both - the latter preferred to the former ) but the ones you meet have the largely the same background as the european kids . As an employer , I'm just as happy to see self-funded world travel on a CV as I am to see a masters . One demonstrates intelligence and commitment , the other , initiative , organisational ability , open-mindedness and determination . The scenarios are very comparable and I would ( and do ) encourage young Americans to get on the boat and get an adult perspective on the world . They'll never look at Fox News in quite the same way once they've actually met a few thousand foreigners .

161507364	635556	Re : Some questions .	I lived for almost a year in Ponca City , Oklahoma back when Jimmy Carter was elected and Alex Haley's Roots was first shown . I was surprised and disturbed by the strength and depth of American racism which seemed to be have a completely different emotive depth to the British variety which was mostly based on fear and ignorance and had , anyway , become ideologically unfashionable in the 70's . I really enjoyed my time there but having lived in France for the two years prior to turning up in the mid West , instead of feeling more cosmopolitan , the effect was the complete opposite . I found I felt more foreign and certainly more English than I ever did in chauvinistic Paris . Perhaps because I was a bit of an exotic rarity . People used to call the Motel and ask to speak to The Englishman . However , despite all this , I had far less trouble adjusting to the Panhandle than the three New Yorkers I was working with .

It is Raymond who calls the police after they all discover the dead body , and he holds the phone to his . . . ( wait for it ) . . . LEFT ear ! Big deal , right ? Maybe not , EXCEPT that in several scenes throughout the film , he is shown claiming not to have heard people who are speaking to him from his left side ( when Morris introduces himself , Ray actually seems to turn his head so that Morris can speak to his RIGHT ear , such as ) . This is a lovely detail from Altman and Dance . The reason that Stockbridge appears to jolt his head has nothing to do with his hearing impairment . It's that he's affronted that McCordle has seen fit to allow someone Jewish loose at a Gosford house party and that furthermore , said Jewish person has taken it upon himself to introduce himself without a by your leave .

161806811	635556	Re : Mulligan Perfect for Eliza - Suggestions for Higgins	I disagree . The world has moved on . Cinema techniques and acting techniques have too . Actors ( most ) train harder these days and so do cinematographers ( most ) and directors ( most ) . Joan Fontaine of Rebecca and Letters from an Unknown Woman was a star of the type you describe , yet her performance in Jane Eyre 1944 looks like a phone-in readthrough compared to Ruth Wilson's performance in the 2006 version which is not a remake . Films of the classics are all remakes . The 1944 version was already the 10th or 11th film version . Tom Hardy was better than Olivier in the 2009 adaptation of Wuthering Heights and just as memorable as Robert Newton as Bill Sykes in Oliver Twist yet many people reading this will have to look at his bio to see what he looks like . The reservoir of * beep * is much higher and writers haven't changed all that much but performances have and that's just a fact of life . I'm very sure that Toby Stephens and Carey Mulligan could deliver a film that moved out of the shadow of Harrison and Hepburn in the first scene and be almost equally enjoyable . Having said all that , there are , of course , performances that may never be bettered . There are four of them in MFL 1964 . And for me , Stanley Holloway would be the hardest act to follow . But that doesn't mean that such performances can't be equalled or that no one should try .

151484717	635556	Re : Welles	Absolutely zero truth . Welles actually , when pushed , claimed very little credit outside the cuckoo clock speech , some polish on the dialogue and some input on a couple scenes but crew members involved with the film at the time say that his involvement behind the camera amounted to ' bug9er all ' . Welles was late on set , frequently disappeared and refused to film in the sewers after his first day . He merely took on the role to pay for a version of Macbeth that he was producing and directing at the same time . It's entirely a myth built by Welles fans . There was a link to both an academic piece on Welles which included the interview and a link to the original source of the cuckoo clock speech in a public lecture at the Royal Academy in the 1880's given by the American painter and wit , Whistler , both now pruned .

163700815	635556	Re : If Great Britain had been defeated in World War 2 then what happens ?	By the time you get to the end of 1972 , they are up and down in their seats at the talks so frequently , it's getting impossible to attribute any one reason to any one interruption so I'll concede that one . The important thing is that the North Vietnamese were clearly getting what they wanted out of the US by December 1972 , which is the withdrawal of US forces . The reasons this was their crystal clear objective was that this would allow them to roll over any remaining opposition in double quick time and the reason that America acceded to what they demanded was that , in the light of opposition to the war at home and abroad , all military solutions had become impossible and the American negotiators had no other choice . What you call things when the fighting stops doesn't matter a toss , to paraphrase Pericles , you can tell who won and who lost by looking to see who is still standing on the battlefield . America was fighting the NVA in South Vietnam for almost 15 years . And then , quite suddenly , it wasn't . And there wasn't any more South Vietnam . French school textbooks used to describe the Battle of Trafalgar as ' an inconclusive naval action in which many ships sank in storms and the English Commander was killed ' . Britain also has a gloriously long tradition in pusillanimous post-war sophistry , as you point out . Giving victories and defeats different names allows the credit and discredit to be fudged and redistributed or allows unscrupulous sovereigns like Elizabeth 1 to withhold payment to the people who fought . With everybody absorbed in their 1919 campaign planning , it took almost a week before Lloyd George's cabinet actually fully realised the British Army had won the war in the field but then only about fifteen minutes before it decide to rob the Army and its Generals of all credit for it .

I'll start with the absolutely beautiful bit of acting from Elsa Mollien as Sophie as she finishes dressing Jane for the wedding . She calls Jane back to look at herself in the mirror and says " Vous êtes trés belle " then a pause . She's going to be the first servant to use Jane's new formal title . She draws a little breath and says " Madame " and gets everything the moment demands into that one word . Ruth's return glance , with several different types of gratitude , is brilliant too .

119942421	635556	Re : Alfa	This thread is getting a bit difficult to navigate He was trying to inveigle her into a relationship , however he was doing this openly . His interest is clearly noted by the other people - Car Darch etc . My point is , he was not using force , or secrecy to acheive this . And how do you know that marriage wasn't mentioned , if not actually intended ? Maybe this is the ' trick ' that Tess complains of . She clearly has some relevation about Alecs character which makes her suddenly take against him and leave . It could be that he wasn't going to marry her You cannot seriously believe any of this . If you do , you have misread the opening section of the book and I recommend you have another look . I promise you , a ' relationship ' with Tess is the very last thing on Alec's mind . Do you think he had a ' relationship ' with Car Darch ? And the others in his chequered history with women . Tess , with her looks , her youth , her innocence and her accent [ clever of this version to draw attention to it ] would make any man go weak at the knees . But Alec is only interested in ownership . Not partnership . It's absolutely at the core of the novel , Hardy's major theme . Tess is a pure woman , faithfully represented and not defined by her male relationships ( which is why her ancestry is SO important ) . Alec isn't a monster like Groby ( another significant realtionship thread ) but he does represent the carelesss , lustful , irresponsible , predatory male buccaneer , interested by and stimulated by the superficial attractiveness of women . To attribute other motives to his behaviour hugely diminishes Tess and the novel itself as a 19C landmark , along with Jane Eyre , in the role of women in fiction . Jane and Tess are those rarest of female heroines , who confront Fate and Destiny face to face without a safety net .
119533012	635556	Re : unicorn	which may certainly have influenced her decision to stay , but it was exactly that - a decision . Unlike later when the family really are destitute , with no money , no home , no breadwinner . This is not really true . The significance of the horse is that it separates them from unskilled agricultural labour , allowing Durbeyfield to make a profit , buying and selling . Since he had no other skills , after the loss of the horse , he would have been forced onto the bottom rung of the ladder , unable to make enough money to keep him in drink , let alone provide for his family and there would have been no question of them keeping the house . Although the value of the horse may have been only £20-£50 , it was the difference between what little security they had and complete ruin . There was very little difference to the Durbeyfields in simple economic terms , between losing te horse and losing its master . Both meant a catastrophic reduction in income , loss of the house and the children leaving school and going out to work . Tess was economically tied to her job and to Alec's charity .
166657767	635556	Re : Why does Harry ? ? ? * * * spoilers * * *	Disregarding the tone , that answer is a summary of an earlier long thread on this subject which concluded that the timeline was roughly as follows : Lime invites Martins to Vienna with , possibly , the idea of getting him to put a gloss on his illegal activities and help him expand them . Another familiar pair of hands in a place where he is surrounded by foreigners . Martins takes much longer to get there than anticipated , possibly because of the fractured transport systems and Lime is missing when he arrives . Martins realises there is something shady going on but gets the wrong end of the stick and decides to stay and investigate . It is vital that Martins is invited before Lime's scheme goes wrong and arrives after Lime has been forced to disappear . No MacGuffin . The film would certainly not be improved by spelling all that out in words of one syllable , in fact it would greatly detract from the amoral , threatening atmosphere which Reed and Greene are working so hard on .

Part of the reason that people's opinions contain such a range of uniformly misinformed prejudice is that The Battle of Normandy has always been treated as an adjunct to D-Day and the invasion . This is partly because of the spectacular , all-forces nature of the landing , partly because of the gigantic and obvious risk of failure and partly because of all the unconventional derring-do . The Battle of Normandy , although the second largest of the war with the highest daily divisional attrition rates , always takes second place to D-Day on the western front and second place to Stalingrad , Kharkov and the Russian recovery on the eastern front

He is the classic second son with little to inherit and his problems exacerbated by Catholicism . What future does he have ? Only what he can make for himself . Antony Blanche gives us a clearly delineated idea of the where the pools in the gay hinterland lie . And whilst I think both Charles and Sebastian may get close enough for the odd long and satisfying drink , neither jumps in and swims about . Sebastian is a sort of British Gatsby . Extravagantly beautiful , rich and charming , but deprived of love and rendered unable to go out and find it . He wants to be taken care of , in the manner to which he has become accustomed and addicted , which is why he keeps going back to Nanny and is fulfilled by tiny achievements like taking care of Kurt . What he really wants isn't Charles , I think . It's Julia or a Julia-clone . And as Charles discovers - she's unique .

This may sound like the . ravings of an 86 year old celibate lit professor , but pick it up in the bookshop and see how long it takes you to put it down again . You'll never regret that gift . There's a second volume which uses more original language and less imagination , so get V1 first . Also not mentioned , the Silverwing series by Kenneth Oppel , my own 10 year old son's favourite author .

123201253	635556	Re : Did the Canadians saved the British from losing WWI ? ? ?	Canadian units did a fantastic job in WW1 . At the start of the war , German units least liked to be opposite Scottish Highlanders , then , after their incredible work at Pozieres in 1916 , the Australians had the reputation of being the toughest opposition . After Vimy Ridge , in 1917 , the Canadians took the laurels , so much so that in 1918 , as the counter attack started in August , the British army faked Canadian radio traffic all over the place to rattle the Germans . But the British Army was predominantly British and the British did no less than their share of the fighting . Statistically , if you were German , the units you didn't want to be opposite were Guards , the Royal Welch and Lancashire Fusiliers . So although they were outstanding , Canadian units didn't win the war by themselves and Canadian Generals didn't necessarily outshine Brits and Ozzies . I've visited most of the WW1 memorial sites in northern France . The Last Post at the Menin Gate is the most moving but the Canadian Memorial at Vimy is still the best , though the new musueum at Thiepval runs it close . They staff the memorial with high flying history graduates from Cananda who have a passion for their subject and do a fantastic job of proving how much the nation still cares . I can't wait to see the film .

146545315	635556	Re : Do you know what's strange ? ?	' Black ' Irish is a bit of a myth . The story goes that in 1588 and 1589 lots of Spanish ships from the Armada ran aground on the west coast of Ireland and the sailors stayed in Ireland producing a mixed community of darker skinned , raven haired folk who looked distinct from the native Irish peasantry . It's a persistent legend but it's all rubbish . Liverpool was the first modern port with non-tidal docksides protected by dock gates which meant that the largest ships of the day could berth at a stationary quayside . Throughout the 18th and 19th century it was a mixed community of all nations - it has the first ' Chinatown - but if Heathcliff had come from the gene melting pot we'd have known about it unequivocally as some of the huge the number of racist pejorative names available to his detractors would have appeared in the book . More likely to have been a gypsy waif . Or even the result of some backstairs action , as Nelly and Hindley suspect .

119780219	635556	Re : Silver	How could he possibly leave her , and them , to their fate , without trying to intervene ? What kind of man could leave them to face the workhouse ? This is either misunderstanding or wilfully misinterpreting the text . The answer of course , is a man like Alec . Alec does not have a philanthropic gene in his make-up . Chapter 42 , the scene at the hayrick in the presence of ultra modern threshing machine , reveals him in his truest light . Any pseudo-philanthropic actions on his part are simply part of his predatory toolkit . He doesn't actually see the woman at all . He doesn't have any insight into Tess - a straightforward and hoenst approach would have won her at Trantridge . But Alec is an advantage-taker , the least attractive thing in the world to innocent pride and though he's intelligent , he has neither the instinct nor the patience to woo her . Worse yet , he has the habit of taking things he wants by force . What Alec sees is a waistline , a bonnet and hair a trim figure - your imagination can fill in the rest . An object of desire . Not love . Not any sort of love . At no point does he ever consider Tess's needs . Only what it will take to recover her submission . You can't rehabilitate him because he took care of her family or flirted with evangelism , nor can you argue that his interest is in any way platonic or philanthropic . He simply wants Tess in his bed and is willing to pay the price .
119536342	635556	Re : It was rape not seduction .	The missing word is adultery , which basically means something impure , or ' mixed ' . And I stand by my orginal statement , there are countries today ( mostly in the east ) which class pre-marital sex as adultery and will even execute people for this . Ah ! The mysterious East . I can't understand why you choose to get hung up on this . BUT your base concept is wrong . Linking the word ' adultery ' to ' adulterate ' is playing with the English approximate translation of the original Hebrew text . The connotations of spoiling or tarnishing come from the Hebrew concept of ownership which defines adultery even more narrowly than I do . Because a woman is a man's property , not only does there have to be a marriage , but only the married woman can commit it . A married man carrying on with a single woman is not adulterous for either party . This concept is immured in all religions based on the Old Testament and the Koran . The adulterer is ' spoiling ' or ' adulterating ' another man's property . Without a marriage a woman cannot belong to a man outside slavery or family . And for the latter there are other names for sexual offences .

So I'm sure they'll go for a smaller age gap in the Toby Stephens , Joe Fiennes ( NOT Ralph , please ) range but they might forget they need a great COMIC actor , judging by some the early runners and riders .

150756355	635556	Re : Can I be the only person here who . . .	First let's get a few things straight . I'm not a Johnny Come Lately here , I wrote the first comment on this show and was keen to welcome it , at the beginning , when a few people didn't know quite what to make of it , by contributing to lots of threads in here . I merely took my eye off things when the board went quiet . My principle contention in its defence is that it's a good and original idea , has a funny and well written script and is a much better use of ITV's drama budget than making anaemic copies of BBC period adaptations like those they wasted their cash on last year . Not entirely original ( I posted a link to Woody Allen's 1975 New Yorker contribution in which a Jewish University lecturer finds his way onto page 135 of Madame Bovary ) but certainly good enough to pass for original on UK TV . As far as feff goes , he knocks people out of discussions by insulting them - an effective tactic on period fiction boards where most posters can't be bothered and starts threads with the arrogant and self seeking ' Am I the only one . . . ' formula . i . e . ' Am I the only one with the intelligence and taste to see beyond what has fooled all the chumpheads in here ? ' You even rebuked him yourself . I don't care whether he stays or goes but I won't be giving him the last word unless he changes his tone . So . LiA . First off , it is not a pastiche of Austen , any more than the episode in which Dr Who and Martha Jones visit The Globe is a pastiche of Shakespeare . I prefer your own construct - that it is a form of dialogue with the original . Much more like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead than Pride & Prejudice with Zombies . The humour doesn't rely , or spring from any satirical attacks on the writer , try to bring Austen down a peg or two , ridiculing her characters , their environment or their actions . Apart from the premise that a 20C character is loose in her world , Austen is treated with the respect she deserves . Much of the reaction depends on how the audience feels , therefore , about going off piste . And that is central to the premise of LiA . Once off piste , no way back . We are going to be looking at P & P through a kaleidoscope . What we have then is a sitcom , in which the leading character discovers that nothing is as expected in a place she thinks she knows intimately and that she cannot behave as she anticipated and that the characters she thinks she knows are all subtly different - the rooms not described , the episodes omitted , the servants not included - from the moment she discovers that Mr Bennet is called Claude , nothing goes to plan . What you need is a good script and good direction to make it work . And I think we have both . The script is full of knowing wisecracks but since what is being attempted is a sideways perspective on 20C life and 18C manners it is entitled to make a few assumptions and it does . The audience is assumed , I think , to be college educated , to have read the book and to have seen the 1995 adaptation . Also , unless one is directly pursuing surrealism , humour has to make sense . If it doesn't when you think about it for more than a second , then it's no more than crude button-pushing . This is where we are really going to disagree because I think this statement is wholly wrong . Humour is perfectly happy to burst like a bubble after a second of laughter . Crude button-pushing that makes you laugh , like pratfalls in Charlie Chaplin movies , is still humour and even were it otherwise , there's still plenty of variety in LiA . Getting Eliot Cowan to jump in the pond is a precise example of this . The only humour in recalling it lies in recalling the surprise felt at the time . The three period drama fans I watched with had to be silenced with a deft use of the live pause button in our house . But after the first episode was broadcast , no one would be able to produce that reaction by relating what happened . The ' spinning in her grave ' gag isn't funny unless you rework it . But they did rework it , with Amanda doing an impression of what it might sound like before revealing what she was thinking of . I enjoyed it . The gag lines have to be disassembled like labrats to analyse what makes them funny and the humour never survives . " Steering the punt from the Cambridge end " is truly hilarious if you know about the Oxbridge snobbery it refers to . The Isis and the Cherwell have muddy bottoms and the pole is inclined to stick so Oxford students steer from inside the boat for greater safety . The Cam has shallow gravel bottom making it easier to punt , so Cambridge students stand precariously on the platform and punt from there . In Austen's day , Oxford was the bastion of the Church of England . Almost all their resident graduates were Churchmen of one sort or another . Cambridge was full of catholics , radicals and sodomites . An in joke , definitely . But very , very funny first time round . And plenty of other examples . Definitely , quite definitely , not teenybopper humour . I'm not willing to defend everything in LiA . For example , I perfectly understand your frustration with its lack of purpose beyond making an elite audience giggle but I can't see anything wrong with that as an aim . And I hold to my contention that it's the best thing ITV ( Granada excepted ) have done on the Austen front . Ever . PS . Who is Miss Collins ?

119060567	635556	Re : It was rape not seduction .	You're wrong . We're going to have to indulge in a bit of close textual analysis to prove it , but as I think Hardy intended to be explicit and only contemporary context has veiled his meaning , and as this is the fourth thread to bring this up , we might as well have a go . The only relevant paragraphs are the last two of Chapter 11 , which closes ' End of Phase the First " . What comes later , at the start of Chapter 12 is explicable in different terms . After the barrier had been crossed Tess might have agreed to , may even have taken pleasure in indulging Alec but that makes no difference to whether she was raped on her way home from the dance . Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue , sensitive as gossamer , and practically blank as snow as yet , there should have been traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive ; why so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus , the wrong man the woman , the wrong woman the man , many thousand years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order . One may , indeed , admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present catastrophe . Doubtless some of Tess d'Urberville's mailed ancestors rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time . But though to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for divinities , it is scorned by average human nature ; and it therefore does not mend the matter . As Tess's own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic way : " It was to be . " There lay the pity of it . An immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroine's personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother's door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm . Those arguing that it was seduction have to explain how Tess , within an hour of almost pushing him off his horse to prevent petting , would permit him to take what was most valuable to her after she imagined they had reached an agreement to call it a night . Then they have to explain the two passages in red . There are all sorts of coarseness to which she could have been subjected short of rape , of course but the highly charged language of the first red excerpt with its ' sensitive gossamer ' and its ' doomed " nature would have been entirely explicit to 19th century audiences . The second passage in red IS explicit . The ' same measure ' dealt ' even more ruthlessly ' . There is no intended ambiguity here . The ' measure ' being dealt to peasant girls is not seduction , a smack on the bottom or Rohypnol in a flagon of mead . It is quite definitely sex without consent . The start of Chapter 12 needs further close analysis ( and a lot more of it ) to understand the relationship between Tess and Alec before she leaves Trantridge but it in no way colours the issue of what happened in the forest . Hardy is being euphemistic not mealy-mouthed . Tess was raped .

If her parent were to settle an annuity of say £100 a year on her , which would be about 3-4 times that cost of decently maintaining her at Goddards , she might have a chance of a decent marriage without the fortuitous visit to the Martins ( which rather proves Emma's point about women who can turn heads ) . However , without an independent income sufficient to genteel life , she'll need a job .

143297486	635556	Re : Answering Objections to the Bedroom Scene	he film's constant emphasis on the sexual attraction between Rochester and Jane is a gross deviation from the novel , which depicts a love between soul-mates , a love that arises from affinity of character and spirit . For me , this is a complete misunderstanding of the original text which , you have to remember , outraged much of Victorian society and about which the publishers had severe reservations of their own . Much of the novel and almost everything to do with the passionate natures of the two leads , is actually written in provocatively warm language . Watch out for it wherever there is a fire . It's not just between Rochester and Jane . There is a warm Sapphic edge to the scene in Miss Temple's room when Jane and Hester go there for crumpets . You don't even need to look for sexual overtones . It's there in Jane from the beginning . This is the passage after the argument with Mrs Reed before she goes to Lowood : I was left there alone - - winner of the field . It was the hardest battle I had fought , and the first victory I had gained : I stood awhile on the rug , where Mr . Brocklehurst had stood , and I enjoyed my conqueror's solitude . First , I smiled to myself and felt elate ; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses . A child cannot quarrel with its elders , as I had done ; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play , as I had given mine , without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction . A ridge of lighted heath , alive , glancing , devouring , would have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs . Reed : the same ridge , black and blasted after the flames are dead , would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition , when half-an-hour's silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct , and the dreariness of my hated and hating position . This is the Jane that Ruth and 06 delivers . The one we always knew was there . A girl , I would say , incapable of a platonic relationship based on spiritual affinities . The stretching of the narrative to deliver , in the bedroom , a true sense of what each is giving up is one of the biggest acheivemnents of the series . Jane and Rochester want each other in precisely the same way that all young lovers want each other . You don't get many accelerated throbs in Jane Austen or Mrs Gaskell .

158758098	635556	Re : Why was Rochester's marriage to Bertha legal and binding ?	No . Even after the 1857 Act , named correspondents and incontrovertible evidence needed . Where couples agreed one would often have to provide the other with the necessary correspondence , witnesses and evidence by , for instance ' taking a prostitute to Brighton , registering at a hotel and allowing the staff to see them together in bed at breakfast . You can follow the process in A Handful of Dust ( brilliant Kristen Scott Thomas performance - well worth looking out ) This is a fragment I saved , during a cut and paste , from the original thread but I can't remember where I got it . At the time this article was published , divorce was divided into two types : à vinculo matrimonii and à mensâ et thoro . À vinculo matrimonii , meaning " the bonds of marriage , " was a divorce that was recognized by the church and by parliament , and allowed the involved parties to remarry ( Shanley 36 ) . Only parliament could grant this type of divorce before the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 ( Stone 46 ) . À mensâ et thoro was a divorce " from bed and board , " and was granted by the church , but involved parties could not get remarried within the eyes of the church ( Perkin 22 ) . This type of divorce is equivalent to a modern day separation . According to the 1853 article in The London Times , the Royal Commission on Divorce and Matrimonial Causes was in favor of maintaining a distinction between à vinculo matrimonii and à mensâ et thoro . While the commission did not propose a change in the law concerning divorce and separation , they did recommend a restructuring of the court system . According to Stone , " the prime objective was to destroy the fifty local ecclesiastical courts by transferring to two new secular courts virtually all their non-clerical business , that is the probative wills and matrimonial affairs " ( Stone 369 ) . The ecclesiastical courts had jurisdiction over religious matters , including marriage and divorce à mensâ et thoro , until the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 . The Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 implemented many , but not all , of the suggestions that were stated in the article in The London Times on the Royal Commission on Divorce and Matrimonial Causes . Jurisdiction of matrimonial acts and divorce was taken out of the hands of the ecclesiastical courts and given to the newly created Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes . Contrary to the Commission's suggestion , the distinction between à vinculo matrimonii and à mensâ et thoro was not maintained , and à mensâ et thoro was abolished and replaced with judicial separation , which could be granted by the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes ( McGregor 17-18 ) . In the article in The London Times , divorces à vinculo matrimonii were suggested only to be allowed in cases of " adultery , and adultery only , " in the case of men seeking divorce , but that the wife could apply for divorce à vinculo matrimonii in cases of adultery in addition to " aggravated enormity , such as incest or bigamy " ( " The Law of Divorce " ) . The Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 also included aggravation of desertion , cruelty , rape , sodomy , and bestiality in addition to these suggestions ( Perkin 303 ) . This extended the influence of the double standard between genders , which made à vinculo matrimonii divorce easier for men to obtain . The double standard in divorce law and the controversy surrounding divorce law reform reveal the complexity of gender relations and gender inequality in nineteenth century England . Even though the Royal Commission on Divorce and Matrimonial Causes was held to address some of these gender inequalities in addition to abolishing the jurisdiction the ecclesiastical courts on the matter of marriage and divorce , many of the double standards remained intact four years later when the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 was passed . Women were not granted equal rights in divorce until a bill was passed in 1923 , shortly after women were granted the right to vote

124131442	635556	Re : is blueray necessary ?	It's not entirely a resolution issue . The Carlton DVD of The Third Man looks every bit as bad as the VHS tape of TTM ( with a newish tape on a decent player ) . The Carlton DVD was made from the same masters that the VHS tape was made from and was therefore just as bad to look at . The Criterion DVD was made from new masters from a restored print . The Criterion VHS tape would look massively better than the Carlton DVD . Then there's conversion artifacts . There is too much information on a sharp 35mm cinema film frame to transfer completely to a PAL or NTSC format screen . So something has to go . Compression of the image takes place . And this introduces visible jaggy artifacts and halos in large areas of slightly changing colour . All the above are PAL or NTSC format . For historical reasons , the frames are split into odd and even numbers of lines which are shown one after the other . This is called interlacing ( i ) . The problem with ( i ) is that it introduces lots of noise and artifacts to add to all the other noise and artifacts in the compression adn conversion process . HD is capable of showing progressive feeds ( p ) where a each frame is shown in its entirety , just like at the movies . No interlacing artefacts . And the greater cpacity of the disks reduces the need for compression . The long and short of this is that a properly prepared HD picture should look better at any screen size because it has far fewer artifacts and no interlacing . But only if the source material is a quality HD feed , as many new movies on DVD are . Be a while before classics on HD become the norm though .
152912125	635556	Re : Disappointing	The 39 Steps is part of H's early British work . And I won't deny it poses one of the great unanswered questions of the 20C ( What causes pip in poultry ? ) . But , to answer your question , TTM has the requisite three unforgettable scenes ( more , for me ) and has important things to say and says them in a highly interesting way . The cinematography alone is enough to earn it its place . There simply are not 60 better films than TTM . There are 60 more fashionable films , 60 films more highly thought of in film schools . 60 more thrilling thrillers , 60 funnier comedies . But 60 better ? 60 that will stand the test of time better ? Not a chance in hell . . . I know Hitch's early work quite well . What , apart from 39 and The Lady Vanishes , do you rate more highly ? Mae West is 216 today .
90755904	635556	Re : Where is Brideshead ?	This is FICTIONYou don't say ! And there was me thinking it was a documentary on declining morals and education standards all this time . Since most people in England know that Oxford is not far from London and Castle Howard is in North Yorkshire , it jarred a little first time around and drew a bit of comment . A bit like characters making a day trip by car from New York to Washington DC . But only a tiny little bit . It would have been more sensible to use Woburn Abbey or Cliveden which is much more like what Waugh had in mind . Cliveden had just such a ' set ' as Waugh describes ( and Celia is keen to experience ) rather than invite endless direct comparison by using the same house as the TV series .

167090056	635556	Re : The opera after Mozart father's death	No one would have heard of Macbeth if Shakespeare hadn't been looking for a Scottish subject to please the new Scottish King of England just as no one would have heard of Don Giovanni if Tirso de Molina hadn't put him on the stage in a similarly successful play . I may be as loony as all get out but you have now been wrong on the same subject three times . Da Ponte may only have seen Bertati's libretto but just as any play with Lady Macbeth driving Macbeth to murder Duncan is based on Shakespeare's Macbeth , because that is the product of Shakespeare's imagination , so any drama with Don Giovanni , undone by romantic attachment and the murdered father of a former lover returning as a stone statue is based on Tirso de Molina's . This includes all three of the later French versions , not just Moliere's and , of course Bertati's and Da Ponte's .

150688214	635556	Re : Can I be the only person here who . . .	Well , thank God ( s ) he's gone . . . . . Wicked et al , you should allow yourself to enjoy the fact that some forms of humour are particularly difficult for some people to tune into . If you've found something hilarious , ( and LiA , wherever you place it on the cultural scale or however unwilling you are to forgive the lese majeste , had more than its share of hilarious moments ) it's because someone has performed the very difficult trick of making you laugh . It's pretty much always at someone else's expense , which is why there are so many high horses in this corral , but hey , comedy creates casualties . The guy who wrote this is a comic genius and there is more and better coming . Only a neanderthal would compare the razor sharp dialogue in LiA to teenage fanfiction . " You mean there really are women who steer the punt from the Cambridge end ? ? " is one of the funniest lines in all TV comedy . It damn nearly did for me , I choked so hard . Originality in sitcom scripts is , by now , something you are entitled not to expect . The idea that a series which is going to throw a 20C character into an late 18C / early 19C drama then has to remain psychologically faithful to the spirit of the original is as silly as the idea that South Park should have done more to promote tourism in Colorado . The vertiginous perspective shift is where the humour comes from and , were I teaching P & P to year 11's , I think the fresh and different look at the characters and situations would be just as useful as any of the adaptations .
130714161	635556	Re : War crime or legitimate military target ?	The bombing of Dresden , like the bombing of London and every other bombed British and German city , had little to do with morale or tactical advantage . It was a strategic effort to end the war based on calculated economic analysis of exactly the same type that led Germany to wage unrestricted submarine warfare . The 500 bomber raid on Coventry on 15th November 1940 damaged thousands of buildings and only failed to create a Dresden-like firestorm because the bombs were dropped over a much longer period . There was no concentration in time . The Luftwaffe came much closer to starting a firestorm in London a year later . But blowing off roofs with high explosive and dropping a mix of different types of incendiary , to set fire to buildings started in Coventry in 1940 . The Coventry raid was extensively studied , by both the British and the Germans and revealed that a direct hit on a defended factory could cause the loss of 3 or 4 days or even a week's worth of production but factories were quick to improvise solutions to actual bomb damage . However , the damage to infrastructure , the supply of utilities , the roads and the railways concentrated at a city centre took much longer to repair and cost many more days of production , even at factories not hit by the bombing . Factories need water even if it's only to flush the toilets . Dozens of undamaged factories were closed for months or production moved elsewhere after Coventry . The bombing of cities was an horrific assault on the innocent , but it was calculated , it did have a purpose , it could arguably have ended the war in the west without an invasion , though at unimaginable cost in German civilian lives . As was proved in Japan . It's sad that a film that is so sincere about reconciliation should inspire all this bilious argument .
146544835	635556	Charlotte Riley	Susanna White , in an interview about Jane Eyre 2006 , said that it didn't matter how good the script , the direction or the sets were , it didn't matter how much of the original they kept or how good the supporting cast were , the success of the production depended on two casting decisions . Get them wrong and nothing else will work . I thought Tom Hardy probably cast himself after his performance as Bill Sykes . He looked like Heathcliff playing Bill Sykes . There has never been a Heathcliff who caught the character's animal nature quite so well or could so effortlessly create menace as Hardy did in the last scene of Episode 1 . So while there is huge amounts to discuss concerning the adaptation , whether it succeeds or not depends on Riley and the chemistry she could generate with Hardy . I thought she was almost entirely successful . She even managed to generate a bit of chemistry with Andrew Oldham , which also has a high degree of difficulty . She was intense , wild , graceful , impetuous and also managed to maintain just enough distance for her ambition to realistically insert a wedge and cleave her from her soulmate . Pity there wasn't time for another hour , it was really , really needed .

142998725	635556	Re : Was Mikhel a traitor ?	There is a subtle difference between the book and the TV series which affects this . To save ages of time explaining , in the TV series the General and Otto try to interest Smiley in burning Kirov and Smiley , unconvinced , asks for 2 proofs . This doesn't happen in the book . 2 proofs are always required under Moscow rules and Vladimir doesn't take it to Smiley until he has them . The difference affects how serious Mikhel's betrayal is . If he knew that Vladimir was working on something big connected to Karla then it's a big betrayal . If , as in the book , all he knows is that Vladimir has received something from an address in Paris that looks interesting and has stirred up a small hornet's nest and he then sells that information for £50 , that's slightly different . But I have no doubt that's where Mikhel's £50 came from .
131996830	635556	Re : How did this beat Saving Private Ryan for the Oscar ?	Shakespeare in Love won big because it was original , witty and about actors . It related modern day show business with the high art of Elizabethan theatre , which was highly flattering to modern day film makers AND apposite . Joe Fiennes is hilarious , so is Geoffrey Rush and the script is full of great wordplay and visual jokes . Made by the director who gave us a Holocaust film with a happy ending and a German hero , Private Ryan is , after the first 19 minutes , a sentimental popcorn movie , full of unrealistic , unhistorical claptrap and terrible dialogue with an ending so mawkish that it made a lot of people feel sick . It's not fit to be mentioned in the same breath as The Thin Red Line or Band of Brothers .

114750780	635556	Re : The picture of Queen Victoria in India .	Barbie explains it best . I forget the episode , though . The picture figuratively represented the ceremony following Victoria's assumption of the title ' Empress of India ' , though Victoria herself didn't attend . The Jewel in the Crown [ of the British Empire ] is , metaphorically speaking , India [ not the literal jewels in the crown painted in the pictue ] . The picture is a metaphor for Britain's supposedly motherly relationship with India ( British magistrates , lawyers , teachers and civil engineers in India in the 1870's outnumbered British-born soldiers 3 to 1 ) This is a contemporary account . The first of January , 1877 , saw the Queen proclaimed Empress of India . The ceremony was most imposing , and in every way successful . Three tented pavilions had been constructed on an open plain . The throne-pavilion in the center was a very graceful erection , brilliant in hangings and banners of red , blue , and white satin magnificently embroidered in gold with appropriate emblems . It was hexagonal in shape , and rather more than two hundred feet in circumference . In front of this was the pavilion for the ruling chiefs and high European officials , in the form of a semicircle eight hundred feet long . The canopy was of Star of India blue-and-white satin embroidered in gold , each pillar being surmounted by an imperial crown . Behind the throne was the stand for the spectators , also in the form of a semicircle divided in the middle , and likewise canopied in brilliant colors . Between these twoblocks was the entrance to the area . Each chief and high official sat beneath his own banner , which was planted immediately behind his chair , and they were all mixed up as much as possible to avoid questions of precedence , the result being the most wonderful mass of color , produced from the intermingling of British uniforms and plumes with gorgeous Eastern costumes , set off by a blaze of diamonds and other precious stones . All the British troops brought to Delhi for the occasion were paraded to the north , and the troops and retainers belonging to the native chiefs to the south , of the pavilion . Guards of honor were drawn up on either side of the throne , and at each opening by which the ruling chiefs were to enter the pavilion . The guests being all seated , a flourish of trumpets by the heralds exactly at noon announced the arrival of the Viceroy . The military bands played a march , and Lord Lytton , accompanied by Lady Lytton , their daughters , and his staff , proceeded to the pavilion . His Excellency took his seat upon the throne , arrayed in his robes as Grand Master of the Star of India , the National Anthem was played , the guards of honor presented arms while the whole of the vast assemblage rose as one man . The chief herald was then commanded to read the proclamation . A flourish of trumpets was again sounded , and Her Majesty was proclaimed Empress of India . When the chief herald had ceased reading , the royal standard was hoisted , and a salute of one hundred and one salvos of artillery was fired , with a feu-de-joie from the long line of troops . This was too much for the elephants . As the feu-de-joie approached nearer and nearer to them , they became more and more alarmed , and at last scampered off , dispersing the crowd in every direction . When it ceased , they were quieted and brought back by their mahouts , only to start off again when the firing recommenced ; but , as it was a perfectly bare plain , without anything for the great creatures to come in contact with , there was no hatm done beyond a severe shaking to their riders . As the sound of the last salvo died away , the Viceroy addressed the assemblage . When he had ceased speaking , the assembly again rose en masse and joined the troops in giving several ringing cheers . His Highness the Maharaja Sindhia then spoke as follows : " Shah in Shah Padishah . May God bless you . The princes of India bless you , and pray that your sovereignty and power may remain steadfast forever " Sir Salar Jung rose in behalf of the boy Nizam and said : " I am desired by His Highness the Nizam to request Your Excellency to convey to Her Majesty , on the part of himself and the chiefs of India , the expression of their hearty congratulations on the assumption of the title of Empress of India , and to assure the Queen that they pray for her , and for the enduring prosperity of her Empire , both in India and England . " The Maharajas of Udaipur and Jaipur , in the name of the United Chiefs of Rajputana , begged that a telegram might be sent to the Queen , conveying their dutiful and loyal congratulations ; and the Maharaja of Kashmir expressed his gratification at the tenor of the Viceroy's speech , and declared that he should henceforth consider himself secure under the shadow of Her Majesty's protecting care . It is difficult to overrate the political importance of this great gathering . It was looked upon by most of the ruling chiefs as the result of the Prince of Wales's visit , and rejoiced in as an evidence of Her Majesty's increased interest in , and appreciation of , the vast Empire of India with its many different races and peoples .

150771277	635556	Re : Can I be the only person here who . . .	That's the problem with written conversation . Judging the niceties . Stand on one side of " Can I just ask you about your post , though . . . cos I thought your post on the QT board was very considered and lucid . " and it's a rather attractive compliment . Stand round the back where you can catch the note of surprise and it can look patronising . Without the visual cues of conversation it's easy to get things wrong . Popularity might not be much of a guarantee of literary quality but it's not a wholly inefficient measure of humour . The joke that Vic Reeves tells which no one laughs at is going to be hard to defend . And that's objective . You are supposed to laugh . If absolutely no one had found H H Munro's tales funny , they wouldn't have been published . It breaks down right there , of course , because there is no scale into which you can put Hector Munro and Monty Python , who both set out to entertain people by writing about different things , any more than you can compare Munro and Wodehouse who wrote about superficially similar things in a very different way . What you can say is that they both made people laugh and were , therefore , competent at their trade . I did in fact , spend a bit of time analysing why the script for LiA is not , whatever else it is , incompetently written but it didn't advance the argument as you generalised what I had taken pains to particularise . The punt joke is very clever . I took it to pieces to demonstrate why . You said " you'll have to do a lot of talking to convince me that this is the general tenor of the whole script . " But of course it is . I could trot out another 10 examples where that kind of craft is evident without referring to the Quotes file : ' let's have 25 children and name the all Amanda , even the boys ' - ' I'm decorating . It's what single woman my age do . It's like sex only you can stop for a cup of tea . ' and the actors positively do not tee these up to cue the audience in with that grimly pregnant glee you see on Matthew Perry or Jennifer Aniston's face when they have a good line coming up . In fact , almost everything Mr Bennet says is hilarious and perfectly executed by Hugh Bonneville . So we're only left with the debate as to whether it is funny or not . It's certainly not going to stand up on any other pair of legs . Did it make people laugh ? Yes it did . Did it make enough people laugh ? Yes it did . It must be funny then . I thought a lot of it was very funny indeed .

The Longest Day at least tries to be realistic . The key things that irritate about SPR are that first , the basic premise is sentimentalised claptrap . You could find out the fate of not just one but two brothers involved in D-Day in an afternoon with a radio . Someone with a brother killed in Italy did . You could find a last surviving brother in Normandy in a couple of hours with a radio , someone did . Secondly , the bijou lessonettes are all rubbish . Normandy was just as vicious and bloody as Stalingrad , in fact , daily divisional losses were higher on both sides partly because prisoners were routinely killed on both sides . The American euphemism for this was ' improving ' ( the only good German being a dead German ) . Killing French civilians in bombing attacks was known as ' liberating ' as in ' St Lo got a good liberating last night ' . That's not the war you see in SPR . By the time the last German crossed the Seine , casualties were touching 500 , 000 .
154047696	635556	Re : Why is the Criterion Collection edition out of print ?	Isn't the higher priced Criterion Collection set just the Blue-Ray version ? There can't be a version of TTM released in 1933 . The price is much higher because the Blue Ray edition has been digitally remastered up to the higher resolution . I might have been interested 10 years ago but my eyes aren't up to appreciating finer pixels any more and I'm not sure it wouldn't look too perfect in remastered high definition . There are people who have bought this edition and are very happy with it , though . There's a longish thread further down about the Blue Ray edition which I've bumped to avoid it getting vaped by the watered down penicillin numpties .
103416979	635556	Re : How did it go down in Spain ?	Very well received on its release in Spain when it was hailed as the best Spanish Civil War film . I still think it is .

The last time Sam Mendes got together with a good writer , a good idea and went off piste for a bit of fun with an author of the classics , the resulting film won a squillion awards and inflicted so much hurt on the boof-headed Spielberg crew that they have never stopped complaining and are still starting ' Saving Private Ryan woz robbed threads ' at the rate of one a week .

161290285	635556	Re : Was THE 1996 Jane Eyre an influence on Sandy Welch's 2006 version ?	I think that all the previous versions influenced the 2006 version . No adaptation has stuck so rigidly to the original language of the book since the ' 83 version , for example . Or made such extensive use of voiceover as the 73 version , where it's sometimes difficulty to tell when Cusack is in dialogue or monologue mode . The 96 and 06 versions are the only two in which Rochester actually looks as if he has fallen off a horse . Performances aside however , rather than showing its influences , the 06 version is distinguished by all the new ideas it brought to the adaptation and the crisp interlocking of its narrative flow which is , for once , an improvement on the original .

Only Apple spend this time because only Apple are obsessed with client-side appeal . The browser on the Android is rubbish compared to the latest gesture-controlled Safari on the iPhone . The Android's Guardian Newspaper app falls well short of the iPhone app in terms of usability . The iPhone app is actually an improvement on the printed newspaper .

I know this is all opinion and everyone's entitled to their own in this post modern age of equivalence but I'm old and totally sick of people who argue that Jack Kerouac is as good as Shakespeare and Damien Hirst is better than Giotto . TTM is plotted , shot and cut together with a perfection that few other movies can match . I think the Hitchcock film it is most like is Shadow of a Doubt with its extraordinarily off centre morality counterpoised by two astoundingly good central performances by the two Charlies who come from the opposite ends of so many different spectrums .
130090652	635556	Re : Quote	Well done getting a transcript up ! When I was watching , I knew it wasn't straight from the book . In fact , they are Austen's own words but collected from different parts of Persuasion all dealing with Ann's feelings for Wentworth . Clever of the writers to alter things in what would be a first draft but it also brings key concepts together without giving the game away completely by naming a character or using the word ' persuasion ' . Chapter 4 . . . . . . . . More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close ; . . . . . . How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been ! how eloquent , at least , were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment , and a cheerful confidence in futurity , against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence ! She had been forced into prudence in her youth , she learned romance as she grew older : the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning . Chapter 7 . . . Frederick Wentworth had used such words , or something like them , but without an idea that they would be carried round to her . He had thought her wretchedly altered , and in the first moment of appeal , had spoken as he felt . He had not forgiven Anne Elliot . She had used him ill , deserted and disappointed him ; and worse , she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so , which his own decided , confident temper could not endure . She had given him up to oblige others . It had been the effect of over-persuasion . It had been weakness and timidity . Chapter 19 . . . She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time ; but alas ! alas ! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet .

158758256	635556	Re : Maybe he should have become a Mormon ?	Yes , Water is the symbol of both G-d's mercy , and his forgiveness .

In any case , there's that rather strange scene in Miss Temple's room with yet another warm fire and an edgily saphhic atmosphere that adds a little colour to Helen's cheeks ( and Jane's ) .
165966924	635556	Re : French wines are much more complex than Napa wines . . .	All true , but remember to take movies with a few pinches of salt . Steven Spurrier has disowned the film . ' Nothing in it is true ' , he said . The Chardonnay and Cab Sauvignon in the blind tasting were being compared to basic Chablis , Buzet and Bergerac not Grands Crus . Exaggeration of the Spurrier results has had two very bad effects . It sent a lot of Napa wine prices to Mount Olympus for what is often quite ordinary wine . Silver Oaks Cabernet at $175 . 00 a bottle - be serious ! - any quality Medoc , Chambertin , Super Tuscan or Clare Valley will beat it hands down at $50 . 00 or less . We see Alan Rickman being ridiculed for offering to pay for a tasting ( VERY , VERY unusual in Europe ) although Chateau Montelena now routinely charges $20 for the privilege . As well as moving prices strongly upward , it hugely over-popularised the heavily-oaked , fruit bomb style of American wine giving rise to the now common wine bar order ' a cold white ABC , please ' ( Anything But Chardonnay ) , ironically losing American winemakers the very market that Spurrier was trying to open for them by making American wine very poor value in Europe when compared not just to French wine , but to better products from New Zealand , Australia , South Africa and South America . The tragedy of the latter is that winemakers in France are now using oak to adjust wines like Alsacian Riesling to the ' international ' taste . Even in Sancerre , where you can still find a $10 wine that will conquer the world ( if you visit ) , the oak monster is on the march . > > The idea that quality mysteriously runs along political borders isn't particularly rational . It does , however , run along the borders of fashion and is heavily influenced by the attractions of market volumes . And the American market is notoriously one which prefers consistency and volume to variation and quality . And suffers far more than its fair share of ' label snobbery ' .

It was never a British idea to leave India divided . Golden Imperial Rule # 1 - Partition Never Works . The British knew they were leaving India as early as the start of the 1920's .

127492169	635556	Re : Steeling ourselves for the last episode ? ? ?	What happened after they were arrested to use a cliche , is a whole other story . The WHOLE point about the diary is that it is Ann's diary , Ann's observations and what happens to Ann seen through her eyes . It should never attempt to go beyond their betrayal and arrest . The ending , I thought , was perfectly executed , right down to the stuttering pause before Ann's caption appears behind her instead of in front of her like the others . For a diary-like account of what the inside of Auschwitz was like , and what an effect any disease epidemic was like , I find Art Speigeleman's graphic novel Maus is the most comprehensive , least earnest acccount and has the immediacy of Ann's diary without the photographically accurate verisimilitude which often accompanies people who are writing with an awareness of the importance of their record and trying to give the Holocaust an historical human relevance and perpsective .

The British and Australians fought a similar but much smaller scale war in the adjacent Malaya Peninsula in the 1950's using psychologically astute ' hearts and minds ' tactics and dealt more or less successfully with a communist insurgency by making it seem economically backward and politically unattractive . We all know what Westmoreland thought of hearts and minds . 20 years after the withdrawal , the Clinton administration did what the Kennedy administration should have done first time around . Instead of sending in the Marines it mustered an army of crack troops from the marketing departments of Coca Cola , The Ford Motor Company , Goldman Sachs , DDB and McDonalds before which the Vietnamese collapsed like ninepins .

105378633	635556	Re : Ruth's latest performance	I love that the X-files casting crew wanted an actress who ' wasn't sexy ' to play Scully and chose Gillian Anderson . Completely forgetting what a turn-on brains and humour are . Not to mention the accent she chose with that little hint of Dixie in there . She also needed a strong back to carry David Duchovny through every episode . Ruth seems to heading for one of those eclectic acting careers , a bit like Coral Browne . Lots of theatre and a few interesting films . No one seems to see her as a leading lady , which , considering the impact her debut lead performance has had is another example of the the quality of mainstream casting decisions .
165085556	635556	Re : Marvellous cinematography that man .	In a big cinema ( or on a HQ sound set up like what I have got ) you are aware of the movie starting after the room fades to black by the sudden wide spatial silence on the sound system , then dawn slowly cracks , then a couple of tiny noises followed by the starter of B25 cracks and the screen gets ever so slowly , progressively lighter . > > Did they get taken outside and shot ?

124303125	635556	Re : Did the Canadians saved the British from losing WWI ? ? ?	I keep thinking we need some better WW1 history but in fact it's all there , it's just that no one reads it . The key component in the misapprehensions about the British Army of 1918 , which far from popular belief , actually has a fair shout at being the finest ever to take the field , is that the politicians who managed it were so keen to avoid responsibility for a repeat of the Somme casualty lists that they first tried to put it under French Command ( so they could blame French politicians and generals for failure ) and then they tried to prevent it from carrying out its own plans by witholdng manpower and when that failed and the Army actually won the war in the field , they made strenuous efforts to deny them any credit by joining the Germans in pretending that the Armistice was not an unconditional surrender , merely an inevitable end to an unsustainable conflict . The French and the Americans were more than happy to let them do it . The idea that the army was badly led or that Haig was a donkey leading lions doesn't stand up to a moment's detailed scrutiny . Even the idea that Third Ypres was an unmitigated disaster is wrong . There were nine battles in Third Ypres , six of which achieved all their objectives and two of the six were almost walkovers . Paschedaele was one of the disasters . And what Haig was most criticised for , continuing the battle in winter when the rest of the combatants were busy planning their spring campaigns , actually won the allies the war , almost unexpectedly , one year later , when the Army crossed the Sambre-Oise canal and left the Germans with nothing to get behind short of the Rhine . What you are calling The Battle of Amiens , I think , is the start of the 100 day counter attack at Villers Brettoneux which won the War and during which the British Army , including units from all over the Empire , advanced 100 miles on a 150 mile front breaking one fortified German position every two days , including the strongest defensive fortifications in history along the Hindenburg line . During this period , the Army's staff work , the co-ordination of forces , munitions and supplies , the courage and determination to succeed has never been surpassed or even equalled . If the same level of tactical and strategic flexibility had been available to Eisenhower after D-Day , the Allies would have been in Berlin in November 1944 . I do not think that the Army was at all unwilling to credit the fantastic job done by Canadians , ANZACS , sepoys and the rest of the troops from the Empire . I actully think it made a good job of this . But British politicians wanted to suppress any credit the Army got for winning the war and put the High Command out to grass almost the moment it finished . These commanders even dreamt about charging in cavalry in the planned breakthrough during the Battle of the Somme ! Cavalry division mostly fought dismounted until the war of movement returned in 1918 . A Canadian Division launched three separate cavalry charges on the morning of 11 / 11 / 18 in and around Mons .

151952336	635556	Re : The Wire Vs . Cracker . . .	The Wire is the best TV series ever made . Cracker has incredible depth for a TV series , breaks all kinds of moulds and conventions . It is brilliantly written by a gifted playwright who , in the mid 90's , was at the top of his form . Not only does Cracker have the best police psychiatrist and the best analysis of motive and character since Dostoyevsky , it has the best cop sidekick in detective history , from Watson to Bunk , in the toweringly wonderful portrayal of DS Penhaligon by Geraldine Somerville , who is plagued by the jealousy of another incredible standout in Jimmy Beck and if even that were not enough , it has Robert Carlisle as Albie , surely the greatest villain of modern times . But The Wire is something else . It's ambition is truly staggering . It lays the city of Baltimore on an operating table and , over the course of 5 years , dissects it without any kind of overall direction or animus , turning the whole of humanity inside out so we can see everything . It is the coolest yet most angry , the hottest yet most dispassionate essay on modern times that we have . To find anything remotely like it , you have to go to an earlier Liverpool playwright writing for television . Alan Bleasdale's The Boys from the Blackstuff has the same quality of vision , the same searching examination of a city in turmoil , but nothing like The Wire's breadth of ambition . Cracker is Crime and Punishment . The Wire is War and Peace .

155768865	635556	Re : Do Americans really not have passports ?	There are people who like travel and there are people who don't .

Amongst the six of them there have been two round the world trips , dozens of trips to Europe , India , Turkey , Thailand , Australia , California , New England and so on and my daughter has been to Sicily enough to almost be an authority on the place . When and wherever they travel there is no deficiency of travelling Americans for them to meet and exchange tales with . Most of the trips are funded by part time jobs and their own hard work wherever people are from . Americans who don't travel abroad imagine that Americans don't travel abroad because it's expensive and they have everything they want at home . English and French people who don't travel abroad think exactly the same . The rest just get on with it . At any one time , there are more Americans in the UK or France than there are in Iowa . It is , however , obvious that people who live less than 100kms from a border with another country , which is probably about a quarter of Europe , are going to have more passports than people who can drive 1 , 000 miles in any direction without needing one .

155637559	635556	Re : Difference between the original and the USA cut . . . . . . .	Selnick was unhappy with Holly Martins character and tried to make him more positive and decisive . Scenes were clipped that showed him in a poor light , such as his ham-fisted attempt to try and make himself attractive to Anna , just before Lime appears . In the English version , you can see that he knows he isn't up to it . The American version ends the scene before he thinks about it too hard . The big change is having him do the voiceover at the beginning . Which gets the whole movie off on the wrong foot and explains why so many people who have seen only this version want to judge it as a film noir . Carol reed himself does the voiceover in the non-US version , which sets a very different , more amoral and much more disturbing tone .

162625633	635556	Re : The Big Picture	What big picture , exactly ? As say , just because there's a car in the background in some scenes , and Marlowe don't make a revving sound with his lips like a car engine to emotionally affirm the car's purpose , doesn't mean he's alienated from the idea of automobile transport . Did you look up alienation in the glossary of Popular Mechanics , by any chance ? The Naked Women are there to emphasise Marlowe's dislocation and separation from the mad , bad swinging sixties . While the rest of the cast and the audience is going gaga about naked women on the balcony , Marlowe is calmly detached and undistracted . The women are , of course , doing it to be admired and attract the attention that Marlowe withholds , though they may just have smoked one too many like the rest of the cast and crew . In any case , separating Marlowe from his surroundings - alienation - is what is behind the idea . It was a buzzword back then . Everyone was at it .

156397481	635556	Re : Do Americans really not have passports ?	Hmmm . Smith and Jones eh ? There is no doubt that the USA has a higher population than Denmark and can afford a bigger Navy . If that's what you mean by wealthier country then there's obviously no argument . Outside an elementary math lesson it's not a meaningful comparison but if it makes you feel better . . . You are , however , either stuck in a metaphor which doesn't work - economies are not cakes that people consciously slice up . Or you don't understand what is meant by wealth distribution . At the end of the 60's most western states had their post-war prosperity plans in place . The US and many other countries ( Thatcherite Britain , for example ) espoused the Friedmanesque principle of trickle down . Tax should not have the objective of creating a safety net for the needy because the more your let your Smiths and Jones earn , the more they spend , the more jobs there are for everybody and the wealth of the nation moves smoothly upwards . The needy benefit from what trickles down from above and have the motivation to go out and fight for it . This theory has , of course , turned out to be bollocks . There are multiple discontinuities which prevent wealth trickling down . As anyone who has driven round Oakland , the Bronx or Detroit can tell you . Better , but still not perfect , is to concentrate on enriching the bottom strata of society by removing obstacles , such as poor accommodation , health and education , and allowing wealth to trickle up . The fat bastards still get all the cash they want with this method , even though they complain bitterly ( and wrongly since it's more efficient ) about tax as the wealth generated at the bottom is there to be harvested by the guys at the top . You might argue ( and I know people who do ) that the second is more cynical and dishonest than the first but it is more efficient and works better , overall , for everybody . Reality is not a place where the USA has an average income of $45 , 000 a year and is a model democratic state . Reality is a place where the USA is the only western state in which you can find whole neighborhoods of houses - hell , whole towns - where the average house price has gone down from $100 , 000 to $0 in five years .

165077424	635556	Re : Jew Hatred is Socially Acceptable Again	> > Jeez , we better not criticize Israel ever again , or else we'll all be called Jew haters . Whilst this is not the core of the political problem , it has become the core of the problem with the debate . The adjective ' anti-semitic ' has acquired such an incredible emotive payload over the 20C that it is irrelevant in describing what the state of Israel does and why it is wrong and why it should be criticised . It simply invites the opposite side to use similarly hyperbolic and overheated language . The whole issue of 20C Jewish catastrophes simply cannot be thrown into the scales every time Israel does something to break an international accord , law or treaty . Israel is certainly quick enough to get the law books out in its defence , even though it seems to regard everything in them as optional when that suits instead . What happened in the 20C to Jews under a variety of governments has not conferred any kind of juridical special status on the state of Israel . Nor is it the ' left ' or ' liberals ' or ' europeans ' who are anxious to bring Israel into line . A solid majority in Israel would like to see their country respecting international law and softening their treatment of Palestinians before Israel becomes a pariah state , like apartheid South Africa . A solid majority outside Israel , from every corner of the political spectrum , wants the same . This article is nothing less than deranged . A desperate attempt to distract attention from the problem by concentrating on irrelevant symptoms . The WSJ should be deeply ashamed of itself for having anything to do with it .
159132533	635556	Re : Couple of nits	I have to take issue with both of those and for the same reason . Whether Rochester intended to get Blanche alarmed about the threat from Jane or not , she instantly is alarmed . This series felt the need to underline it with the ouija board scene and drew attention to it in other ways , such as allowing the conversation to get intimate in Blanche's hearing and letting us see Blanche being explicitly hostile . But Rochester and Blanche are both playing a complicated game and using Jane as a pawn . Once again I think we are seeing what is there in the book through the lens of faithful ( though not meticulously accurate ) adaptation .

Watch your image of the guys banging on bins used very effectively by Julie Taymor as a musical image of Liverpool in Across the Universe .

119804319	635556	Re : Angel	I think I suggested higher up , or in another thread , that the symbolism associated with Angel Clare's name went a bit deeper than the obvious connotations of his christian name . Alec's surname is a masque . ' Stoke ' his real name is a slang word for copulation . Though I think you may be stretching the seraphic connection to its limit , ' Clare ' is also a female Christian name , St Clare was the first assistant of St Francis of Assisi and a model for female virtue . Angel has many womanly qualities which counterbalance Alec's alpha maleness . No one , as far as I recall , thinks Angel any more than one of Aesychlean agents of disaster . But you do not need these simple oppositions . They both destroyed an innocent , one with his predatory lust , the other with his narrow-minded propriety . So they are not opposites in that sense .

Hundreds and hundreds of people were involved . Nothing remotely that complicated was possible in France , for example , because of the scale of collaboration . 1200 Jews who were not attacking them would have dropped off the priority list fairly quickly .

131085115	635556	Re : This movie is a joke	That statement is meaningless . Technically speaking , the name for that logical fallacy is " Appeal to authority " , i . e . " If you knew what I know , you'd know I'm right " . You should probably limit yourself to one of either sneering abuse or deconstructing logic . They don't go well together in the same post and I can't advise because you don't seem to have a talent for either . You're not much better at detecting character development . There's just as much sex in Marlowe's first two novels as there is in the last two . In the Simple Art of Murder , Chandler sets out a manifesto for crime fiction and explains exactly where he thinks the limits of behaviour are . Marlowe's behaviour is entirely consistent from first to last , which is why the last thing we see him doing is insisting on paying for Linda Loring's airplane ticket . If you're talking about earlier manifestations like Carmady , well they're not Marlowe , are they ? There are hundreds of ways of reflecting how different the 70's were from the decades that preceded them and Altman had a much better feel for history and the passage of time than is evidenced here . Casting one trick pony Gould was a disastrous mistake . Marlowe is simply miles beyond his limited range . The rest of the cast is equally grim and the whole enterprise is a terrible mistake .

The Radcliffe line settling the border between India and Pakistan was constituted in a British Act of Parliament , before independence of course - how could two states be given the job of drawing up their own borders ? Acts of Parliament require only one signature , not ' signatures ' . Gandhi's Quit India campaign started in 1942 , led to civil unrest , rebellion in the both Army and the Navy and set the timetable for independence . the decision was still British . Absolutely not . The British were strongly against partition but accepted it as inevitable and tried to do the best job possible in the short time they felt was left to them .
164264202	635556	Re : I'll give you five reasons ( there are , of course , more )	Whether the blockade is legal or not ( and it is not ) , were it entirely watertight , it could not confer legality on a commando attack on a passenger ship in international waters . Selective reading of maritime law , from sections which do not apply , cannot defend it either . None of the definitions of ' belligerent ' apply to Turkey , from where the ship sailed or to the Comoros Islands where it was registered . Nor do they apply to Gaza or indeed , Israel . Nor were any of the regulations for the conduct of a maritime inspection respected , especially those relating to the use of proportionate / disproportionate force . Unlawful arrest . Unlawful killing . the legality of the whole thing doesn't even matter really . This is a precise illustration of the problem most in need of a solution . You are not allowed to do anything you like simply because you feel threatened .
119526711	635556	Re : How long would Angel have served ?	Given that he was witnessed at the scene immediately before the murder and immediately after effected her escape , he could have been charged with accessory to murder and hung with her . I think the fact that he could afford a defence and there was an overheard struggle would have protected him and in murder cases , police are inclined to drop or reserve minor charges while the major one is heard . After Tess was sentenced I can't imagine anyone thinking that justice had been short-changed .

The ' 83 version for me , misses the tone and ' essential story ' almost entirely . Dalton is bloodless and Clarke is just incompetent . It's called Jane Eyre . It scandalised Victorian Britain , yet most adaptations have to manage without the lead . In the ' 83 version , the lead actors do not deliver one tenth of what's inside the characters compared to ' 06 , nor does ' 83 deliver any of 06's spot-on gothic background . It misses out entirely on the richness of the setting and landscape and ignores the dense symbolic content of the original . By acknowledging it , recreating it rather than trying to reproduce all it bit by bit , the 06 version gets the ' tone ' right . It's the only adaptation that does . Excessive fidelity to the source will not always give you the most accurate adaptation . ' 06 delivers a believable , developing , passionate relationship in a credible Brontean environment . There's nothing like that in ' 83 and ' 73 is worse .
161048948	635556	Re : How did this beat Saving Private Ryan for the Oscar ?	Not a snide comment . People constantly seem to throw in their academic qualifications to add weight to their arguments ( or defend manifestly stupid positions ) . There are very few films like SiL , where writers have dared to play games with high art . SiL is the most successful . How can I claim that ? Simple . Check out the awards . Check out the box office . So someone claiming to have studied Renaissance Drama rubbishing one of the few coherent films ever made about it is actually unusual enough for the authenticity of any qualifications to be questioned . I had absolutely no difficulty suspending any disbelief and in fact , think that in suggesting Shakespeare was a slovenly , unwashed , womanising chancer , stuck for an idea , SiL is considerably more insightful than large amounts of the critical stuff I have read on the subject . And to add the suggestion that what the Elizabethan dramatists were doing was inventing showbusiness rather than modern drama is another highly entertaining sidelight . There surely was a point when Will got sick of the sound of Marlowe's name . I cannot see how anyone with a modicum of appreciation for the period equipped with the slightest understanding of the dramatists could think that SiL , with its brilliant acting and glittering Stoppard script , was the worst film they had ever seen . But there's no accounting for taste . Also how quick does Shakespeare walk across London in the film , he gets from one side to another in the space of twenty minutes ! Did they cover dramatic licence on your course ? I think not . In any case , at no point in SiL does a walking character cover more ground than a reasonable fit person could cover on foot today . Shakespeare's London was contained in a couple of square miles either side of London Bridge .

163491165	635556	Re : If Great Britain had been defeated in World War 2 then what happens ?	Calm down , calm down . I am not being totally ironic and am not being sarcastic at all . In your post-war world America becomes top dog and can deal with a unified Anglo-German , right-wing-dominated but united Europe . I think this is wholly unrealistic and that well-worked out peace settlement between a post-Hitler government and a Halifax-led UK Coalition could have and would have led the USA by its political and economic nose , since the US is now deprived of the shot in the arm that mobilisation brings , the huge incomes it received from participants and is now a lightweight when it comes to international influence . The likelihood of base scenario occurring is , of course , statistically negligible , which is why I think a bit humour is not inappropriate to the argument , but my principle point is that , in 1940 , the idea that US could fix whatever happened Europe , however bad , particularly with long-range weapons it didn't have , is quite simply wrong . As far as Viet-Nam goes , Rolling Thunder started 5 years before negotiations . Dissent and protest in the US and the failure of the Tet Offensive brought the Viet-Namese to the table . There are lots of different casualty figures , the principle problems being lack of accurate records and falsification of the figures to avoid demoralising a population that was being decimated . But the pendulum which swings between 1m and 8 . 5m is starting to point to mean civilian casualties in the former Indo-China at between 2m and 3m . The French Foreign Ministry puts them much higher . I lived in Paris a few years after the war , when it was a constant topic of debate . This is ( approximately - I had to dig for an AFP press release on the net ) their assessment . " . . . the true civilian casualties of the Vietnam War were 2 , 000 , 000 in the north , and 2 , 000 , 000 in the south . Military casualties were 1 . 1 million killed and 600 , 000 wounded in 21 years of war . These figures were deliberately falsified during the war by the North Vietnamese Communists to avoid demoralizing the population . " Their top figure then , if you add their figures of 600 , 000 in Cambodia and 500 , 000 in Laos comes to about 6 . 2 million which is two to three times as high as where the pendulum has come to rest but French demographers believe that from what they know of the population , before and after , that these figures pass statistical sanity tests . But they're French .

You posters must be in your teens That's simply unfair after Matt has taken so much trouble to steer the thread away from knockabout nonsense to focus on why people are disappointed with the film . I think it's perfectly OK to hate films with big reputations , be they box-office or arthouse . Lord of the Rings , Forrest Gump and the Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie , for example , are all in my unwatchable gak bin . But quite a few films have made it back out of there , The Red Shoes , for example . It's hideously easy to dislike things for the wrong reasons but it's a habit everyone educated tries to get themselves out of . Otherwise no one would ever go to a Rothko exhibition and there would be no Angel of the North . The Third Man is an acquired taste . Despite the presence of Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten , it has a very strong British accent and for once , the Brits are the good guys . It's setting and environment are unique and from the first sentence , it is totally amoral . It has nothing in common with Welles ' other work ( or Selznick's ) , so it's no surprise that it can take a time or three before people warm to it . It is , however , despite all its shortcomings and unpopularity , a masterpiece .

155175924	635556	Re : Is this film noir ?	You'd have to ask a film student . It's a term which does not have any sort of precise critical meaning outside film schools and even then students seem to change their minds every time the subject is raised . Personally I think ' noir ' is a style like ' western ' - you can have two movies which both fit the description but have almost nothing else in common while ' genre ' movies share themes and ideas and even characters but ' genre ' seems to have expanded to cover everything that means ' group of stylistically similar films ' . Barton Fink is asked to write a wrestling picture and produces something that is outside the genre , much to the producers disgust . We can all get to grips with what wrestling pictures are about from the descriptions in the film . That would be a ' genre ' for me but I'm an old stuck-in-the-mud . TTM is not any kind of genre film but it does have ' noir ' overtones .

A US-German war was pretty much inevitable , especially given that there would be no German-British detente just a ceasefire until the Nazis tired of an independent UK . My enlightened Nazis and Right Wing British conservatives like each other rather a lot and since the end of hostilities , they have worked out how strong their joint hand is and how to keep Uncle Joe and Uncle Sam on their own sides of the fence . Yes I was . You are now but you weren't then . Now you are talking about a late chapter in the talks and a late restart to the bombing . First time it was just ' Bombs ' produced ' Talks ' which is incorrect . Talks were resumed in spring ' 72 the day after Nixon announced he was pulling out 20 , 000 troops and some weeks after the resumption of bombing which was no more than a predictable reaction to the March offensive which itself came after an earlier resumption of the bombing in Dec ' 71 . In fact , the US had defeated the Viet Cong and the anti-Communist side had the upper hand when the US pulled out combat forces . It retained the upper hand until the US Congress decided to stop proving logistic aid to the South while the North still had the support of two superpowers . Can't see where or how you can support this . It took 55 days to knock over what the US left behind after around 25 years of war . US Congress and the Senate , at the time , I seem to remember , were busy trying to stop Nixon kicking field goals by moonlight as the US continued to bomb Laos and Cambodia .
150523795	635556	Re : Favourite moments / quotes	I watched the final episode again last night . I think the scene after Box Hill where Knightley tells Emma he's going to London is my favourite . The acting in this scene especially from Romola , is some of the best in any period adaptation ever . Every ounce of strain on this crisis point in their relationship shows in both their faces .
157932432	635556	Re : Atlantic Man ?	Before WW2 , different areas of international intelligence gathering were once classified as the provinces of different branches of the service MI6 , MI7 , MI8 and so on . Doc Sallis in The Honourable Schoolboy is a China specialist , for example . After the war they were pretty much all brought together as MI6 . In the case of Enderby and Sam Collins Atalntic Man meant they respected and worked submissively and collaboratively with American Intelligence . Control and Smiley , veterans of the intelligence war against Germany and the earliest participants in the Cold War preferred their own methods . In Le Carre's world , Atlantic men are new generation , less principled and less subtle .

158825224	635556	Re : a bit confused about one thing	I think you're right . A bit more determined googling turns up an academic article by Brian Southam published in 2002 which agrees with you ( and me ) . Entitled ' Rears and Vices in Mansfield Park ' you can see the first page here http eic oxfordjournals org cgi pdf extract 52 1 23 and this is from a Guardian review of the article : - = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = There was a time when " a novel announced as the work of ' a lady ' could be counted on to be ladylike in its freedom from indecent humour " . In Essays in Criticism , Brian Southam takes to task the persistent misreading of a passage in Jane Austen's Mansfield Park ( 1814 ) in which Mary Crawford describes life with her uncle Admiral Crawford . She speaks of being " acquainted with a circle of admirals . Of Rears , and Vices , I saw enough " , presumably punning on Rear - and Vice-Admirals . But one critic saw it is a " shamelessly open reference to homosexual sodomy " , a line followed by most critical editions of the novel . Not so , says Southam . The social and literary conventions of the age frowned on jokes about sodomy and he is saddened that this innocent pun has sparked " a wider campaign to promote the idea of a bawdy or dirty-joke Jane Austen " , even insinuating a vulgar pun in the name Fanny Price . To check this mischievous " subtext of sexual punning " , he reminds us that Austen wrote within a strict genre of " the Woman's Novel : fiction written by women , primarily for women , about the woman's world " . Austen's publishers were alert to the faintest whiff of salaciousness ; after all , under the navy's disciplinary code , sodomy was one of the few offences punishable by death . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = In other words , it's rubbish .

119790616	635556	Re : Professor John Sutherland	" This article is a response to an essay written by an academic in English Literature , Professor John Sutherland . Through close textual analysis , Sutherland purports to resolve a well-known literary question : whether the sexual encounter outlined in the Victorian novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles should be classified as rape or seduction . The present article rejects his conclusion on the matter . An ( equally ) close analysis of the fictional text in question and of Sutherland's gloss , demonstrates the partiality of his critique , both in literary-critical and critical-legal terms . In addition , examination of the conceptual and historico-legal context regarding the notions of rape and seduction on both sides of the Atlantic highlights parallels between Sutherland's own partiality and that of the law . In short , the apparent objectivity of the textual analysis and subsequent critique undertaken by Sutherland is revealed as a continuation of legal and patriarchal prejudices defining rape and seduction . The use of close textual analysis as the key critical device promotes the apparent probity of his findings . Locating them in an essay collection designed for mass lay public consumption completes the circle - - from partisan scholarship to ' informed ' popular prejudice . " ' ' Is Alec a Rapist ? ' ' - - Cultural Connotations of ' Rape ' and ' Seduction ' - - A Reply to Professor John Sutherland , M Williams , Department of Law , Aberystwyth University I don't have a JSTOR account to get at the article but since he's been mentioned half a dozen times it helps to know that he's not representing any accepted academic norm .
146469471	635556	Re : Desperate ? Yes . Romantic ? No .	Incorrectly regarded as a goof , this one . Tits were invented in 1807 , initially just for the use of Napoleon's Imperial Guard , which is why the French have such a louche reputation . The initial design was based on a 12 mm French trench mortar and whilst these are still very popular in the USA and elsewhere , the army preferred a later implementation based on champagne glasses . They have been routinely fitted since the Bronte's began the Women's Movement in the 1850's .

There aren't any advances in smutty jokes between Fielding and the 20C . I really do think the MP sodomy reference is a total nonsense . Apart from being spectacularly beyond even Mary Crawford's level of gaucherie , it is pointedly singular . If she meant to include ' rears ' and ' vices ' , Austen would have written ' do not suspect me of punning ' or ' puns ' . Given that her prose is always as precise as celestial navigation , I think her meaning is clear .

156170003	635556	Re : Do Americans really not have passports ?	Your argument would be fair enough if Yerpeens always travelled in Europe and didn't cross the Atlantic , paying those same exact same airfares in the opposite direction . ( Interestingly , I first went from London to Washington DC in 1976 and the fare was $610 . ) But they do . My daughter is 22 and her next trip to the States will be her fifth . Here's an observation based on experience of holidaying with the American families of friends I made when I lived there . Americans take less vacation and as a consequence will spend much more time organising and fretting over their trips . It's not uncommon for American friends to spend 3 months planning , say a walking tour in in The Cotswolds and then give it all up and go ( as part of a different group ) to Cancun .

130848333	635556	Re : War crime or legitimate military target ?	The truth is that Dresden was incredibly unlucky . It was , like all RAF targets in Germany , strategic rather than tactical but it was never a primary target . When the list of cities in eastern Germany was drawn up , the odds on Dresden receiving a 1000 bomber night raid were very long . Night bombing required a minimum of 50 % clear sky over the target for at least three hours , so that two flights of 400-500 bombers could approach , three hours apart . In early February the weather was bad and Dresden was one of the first clear targets , though even then , it was only clear for the minimum required time , much less than forecast . 10 minutes more cloud cover and , because of the proximity of russian forces , 5 group would have diverted and bombed Chemnitz blind . Unlucky again . It was unlucky that 5 Group led the attack . Their Mosquito pathfinders were an extraordinary group of fliers who dropped their marker flares from 100 ' with accuracy measured in metres . 5 Group pioneered the Master bomber technique and had multi-vectored approach down to a fine art . 95 % of the bombload dropped less than a mile and a quarter * from the initial marker flares dropped in the cycle stadium . ( 150 of the 450 US bombers on the follow up daylight raid bombed other cities by mistake - 60 B-17s bombed Prague 100 miles to the south having mistaken a bend in the Elbe ) It was unlucky that a firestorm started . A rare event , little understood then . In the context of the incalculable number of war crimes committed to the east and coming to light at the time , it could be counted as tragic excess but not a war crime . * The equivalent figure in 1940 was around 2 %
157620123	635556	Re : Ratings for ' Emma ' on PBS	TV critics are like sheep , or even worse , sparrows . They have an unbreakable herd instinct when it comes to reviewing anything that they might have been supposed to study at university . The funniest example of this occurred in the 70's when the BBC War & Peace was first broadcast . A solid majority refused to comment on the first episode while they ' digested ' their response to the classic . What they actually wanted to do was see what everybody else had said . The negative criticism was all on the same theme ' it's too modern and takes too many liberties ' after one of the production staff gave an ill-advised interview saying they had gone for a ' modern feel ' and ' had taken one or two liberties ' . They descended on Welch and her thought provoking and enlightening intro and on Garai , who can project what is going on in her character's head to a tee and they decided this was all wrong . Unfortunately for the herd , there was a lot of very significant counter-criticism before the series was over , pointing out that even some academic treatises on Emma had previously missed the fact that Emma , Jane and Frank were all in the same tragic boat as young children and each faced very different consequences following the decisions of their parents . Then pointed out that Garai , however modern you thought she was , delivered such an incredible range of emotional depth that any complaints about how it might deviate form the time-honoured cliche of straight-bonneted and straight-backed period heroines amounted to no more than childish nitpicking . Misguided nitpicking at that . The American critics were a bit more cautious with their doubts , if they had any . This Emma contains some of the best acting , writing and production that have ever been seen in an Austen adaptation and you don't even have to look hard for examples . Two of my favourites are Knightley's reaction to Emma as she approaches him at the dance , where he is visibly knocked off his feet ( and who wouldn't be ? ) and Emma's reaction to the news that Knightley is going away the day after Box Hill , which is followed by the tremendous scene in which she discovers Harriet's interest in Knightley . TV critics slagging it off after Episode 1 should all be ashamed of themselves .
124395182	635556	Re : Did the Canadians saved the British from losing WWI ? ? ?	The Canadian Light Horse were in an around Mons on the 10th and 11th November and took it into their heads , like a lot of units , that the future borders would be drawn where the front line was located . On the morning of the 11th they mustered the horse into three platoons who went around the lanes in Mons mopping up and finished the War miles into what had been German territory earlier that morning . Hardly cavalry charges , I know ( though their web page claims a swords out charge on October 10th - well after Moreuil ) but a handy reminder that there were plenty of opportunities for mounted soldiery throughout WW1 .

Some English historians are tending to treat the colonial conflict in 1770's as the first American Civil War , these days . Whilst an independent American state was definitely the result , almost a third of the population of the 13 newly independent colonies upped sticks and moved to Canada , where the Continental Army made little or no impact . The British won almost all the encounters that the war triggered in the Caribbean , decisively crushed the French in India and strengthened its naval dominance to a global mastery that lasted throughout the 19C . Although the war resulted in the establishment of a new , independent and ferocious economic competitor , France went bankrupt and suffered a Revolution and Spain and Holland both decided that there wasn't much to be gained in conflicts with the English .

In the case of the Third Man , I'm thinking Eddie Murphy as Holley ( ticks a box ) , Russell Crowe as Calloway , Danny de Vito as Lime ( that should open a few new comedic possibilities ) and Alicia Silverstone would rinse the Alida Valli role , especially if she'd get her kit off .

Still in the top 20 even if you call him English ( grew up in England , went to Public School with P G Wodehouse , worked in the Admiralty with Ian Fleming , served in a Canadian Regiment in WW1 , Evelyn Waugh was his biggest fan and he lived a large part of his life as an English citizen ) . Brackett is good enough to clean his shoes , which is about what he's doing in this film . The best writing in English today is done by Americans , but not in any purist tradition . They have roughed the language around as Shakespeare did and done it the violence of melodrama and the press box . They have knocked over tombs and sneered at the dead . Which is as it should be . There are too many dead men and there is too much talk about them . Chandler revolutionised American prose by combining Waugh's gift for precision and Wodehouse's crisp ironic tremolo with an exclusively American vocabulary and almost every American writer since has drawn on his achievement . Brackett's a hack . A damn good one , but a hack . Altman's a flaky genius . The Long Goodbye is a joint misfire .
164731640	635556	Re : England is going to Destroy the USA tomorrow ,	John Cleese went on Leno at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Leno asked him what the difference between England and the USA was . Cleese said there were three big ones . ' 1 . We speak English and you don't 2 . When we arrange International Sporting tournaments , we invite other nations 3 . We only have to go down on one knee to our Head of State ' I sometimes think most of what's wrong in America is down to the fact that all their team sports are only played by schoolgirls in the rest of the world . I think that the USA have a 100 % record against England in World Cup Finals , mind . Played 1 won 1 .
93221527	635556	Re : What on earth was that ?	A double disappointment for me . I recorded it and watched the first five minutes . It was all looking so good at that point . Brilliant sets and atmosphere and Derek Jacobi just revving up . But instead of plunging us deep into the Victorian London so carefully recreated in the sets , we went skating over the surface in the ensuing 115 minutes and like coldwindtovalhalla , I can't work out where , in two hours , all the missing plot went . You can't do Dickens at this speed . Getting it right in an adaptation obviously doesn't mean getting the whole 500 pages on the screen but it does involve getting the chemistry of detail and pace right , as the recent Bleak House serialisation did . None of the central relationships really came to life , with the possible exception of the brass siblings and even Quilp was a bit of a pale Nemesis compared to Philip Davis ' Smallweed , much less Charles Dance's Tulkinghorn . I'll watch it again to make sure I'm not still recovering from Cranford , but I'm not sure I'm being unfair . Turning over to Ballet Shoes , however , in the absence of a VCR , would have been a good decision in my book . I quite enjoyed that .

They have important and interesting answers , some of which have been suggested and anticipated in other threads . In relation to Alec's guilt at The Chase they are , however , simply the wrong questions . Why , when she was being attacked by a large group was she " stepping out of the frying pan into the fire " ? Why did her predecessor at Trantridge also leave suddenly ? Why was she drugged without her knowledge in the serialised version ? How is she ' pure ' if she gives in to seduction ? How can Angel , whose narrow mind has heard the whole story , describe her as ' spotless ' if she wasn't coerced ? Why did they know at Marlott of a rape at The Chase a year earlier ?
37857165	635556	Re : An insult to the novel ?	Please don't listen to the director's commentary if you are an admirer of the book . The disrespect and lack of insight will enrage you . Rozema can't tell the difference between classic literature and Mills and Boon . It's implicitly apparent in the film but becomes painfully obvious when you listen to her . Ignoring the film , for a moment , readers of Mansfield Park fall into two categories . Those who think Fanny should have married Henry Crawford and improved him and those who are horrified at the prospect . Although this sometimes creates a rather silly debate , it is actually crucial to understanding the book . Fanny and Mansfield Park are tied together as Austen's ideal of principle , honour and respect for the achievements of civilisation . The Crawford's are the enemies . Rushworth , Tom Bertram and his like are their prey . And Mansfield Park , despite Sir Thomas ' stewardship , is under threat . Fanny is its guardian and only compatible with the other guardians of the Mansfield Park ethos . So you're not likely to do justice to any of Austen's concerns if you toss away the bedrock , show the house as falling down , treat the main themes with Rozema's hideous flippancy and toss in a load of low comedy and irrelevant pickings from other parts of the canon . I do understand why people like this film . But it is an EXECRABLE adaptation of Mansfield Park , Austen's finest achievement .

159757232	635556	Re : Answering Objections to the Bedroom Scene	The deleted bedroom scene doesn't work as a flashback during the Rivers episode . The other two work brilliantly , keeping the focus where it needs to be and stopping the whole thing feeling like a stuck-on interlude . No one skips the Rivers scenes in this version . They viscerally illustrate the source of Jane's grief and underline what she has given up for her new life and why . The deleted scene , were it introduced before the flashbacks would hugely reduce the impact and the intimacy of the two included scenes . If it were introduced afterwards , it would bear directly on Jane's dilemma with Rivers when the purpose of the flashbacks is to focus attention back on Rochester . This kind of decision making is one of the adaptation's great strengths .

112427343	635556	Re : watered-down penicillin ? - Warning : Spoilers	In the 1941 film " Buck Privates , " Abbott and Costello also join the US Army . Does anyone actually believe either of them would pass the physical any more than Laurel and Hardy would ? The army wasn't that desperate before Pearl Harbor . They seem , however , an awful lot smarter to me than the modern GI's we see on the box . In " Speed " ( 1994 ) , how was rogue cop and bomber-extortionist Howard Payne able to set up such an elaborate backup plan and sophisticated bomb on an LA bus in such a short time ? He was on Speed In " Die Hard 2 " ( 1990 ) , what an incredible coincidence that John McClane's wife Holly and reporter Richard Thornburg from the first movie should be on the same plane at the exact time terrorists make an attack on the airport , threatening incoming planes . In 25 years of flying , 20-30 people I know have coincidentally turned up on the same plane as me . It called ( get this ) , a coincidence . They happen all the time Also in " Die Hard 2 , " after killing the entire crew , including the rogue crewman who helped him , how was General Esperanza able to fly a lumbering military transport aircraft that needs at least three people to man it to Washington , DC ? You should't have been watching Die Hard 2 . Nobody should As a U . S . Army veteran , I am personally insulted by all the rogue soldiers , marines , and veterans dealing in drugs and illegal weapons in 1980s and 1990s action films . From Lethal Weapon I to Die Hard 2 , you would think that every American colonel goes to work for drug dealers and hostile countries the minute after he retires . I guess once the US Army had taken over the supply routes in South East Asia in the 70's , all those drugs had to end up somewhere . They say it takes a while to get them out of your system . Again in Die Hard 2 , how does McLane manage to jump off a speeding plane getting in the process of taking off without suffering serious injuries ? In fact , don't watch anything with a numeral in the title , especially a semi colon followed by a digit . Why are the authorities unable to do anything but McClane is able to make a heroic but futile attempt to save the British airliner heading for destruction ? Even in 1990 , there were a half dozen ways to warn it off . Some people just love the British , I guess . Unlikely I know , but I can see how it might happen . And some don't . Does anyone believe that an entire platoon of elite Army Rangers could be bought off to rescue a drug kingpin and ex-dictator their country overthrew ? Surely at least one man would have said something . Gotta depend on how many of those illegal drugs they were offered , surely ? In real life , Richard Thornburg would have brought charges against Holly McClane for assaulting him , and unfortunately , they would have stuck . Like Mark McCormack who knew a thing ot two about this , let ' DON'T sue the bastards ' be your watchword ( s ) . After he's saved her life twice , resulting in tearful reconciliations , by Die Hard with a Vengeance ( DH3 ) , Holly McLane still divorces John . What an ungrateful witch ! You went to see DH2 . What on earth were you doing in DH3 ? And however many times he saved your life , would you really want to spend even 10 minutes in the company of Bruce Willis ?

He didn't need much persuading , especially after he'd seen the ' 44 American film . The best account of a bombing raid , which charts both the raid and its effect on the German population which had to endure it , is the BBC's radio adaptation of Len Deighton's Bomber . It's accurate and well researched and dispels a few common myths , still widely believed on imdb .
145941734	635556	Re : Most Overrated General	As you say , reverting to 1918 methods is not a slight . 1918 methods in the British Army were pretty efficient , involved very close integration between different battlefield services and were massively more flexible . If the Allied staff work had been up to 1918 standards , they might well have finished the war in 1944 . They would certainly have got from Normandy to the Rhine more quickly . What Monty did in Africa , which definitely did have its roots in WW1 , was to plan a pitched battle down to the last can of fuel instead of galloping backwards and forwards De Gaulle-style along a 1 , 500 mile front containing only three or four strategically important objectives .

155106094	635556	Re : Why can't tv and movie stick to the facts in the book ?	All the period drama boards are decorated with people who have read the book and feel obliged to report every difference they spot between it and the original as if this was some sort of elite intellectual activity when you could carry out exactly the same exercise with two different rolls of wallpaper or two plastic pigs in a toyshop . Understanding and imagination are the two most important things for adapters . You need the first to get onto the author's wavelength and the second to serve your audience faithfully by delivering the heart of what's in the book to the screen . You simply cannot do this by transcribing the original dialogue from the novel to the screenplay . This is the best adaptation of Emma by a very , very long distance . Quite possibly the best Austen adaptation ever . Maybe even the best period adpatation ever . Condemning it after ten minutes is not a sensible use of bandwidth or intelligence . Not in here , anyway .
149823131	635556	Re : JLM is best Knightley ?	Characteristically , I think all the characters in this version are closer to the book than any of the other versions I have seen . Sandy even made Michael Gambon read it . Two examples , though there are others . John Knightley has been a cardboard cut-out in every other adaptation but here you can see how his selfishness is part of Emma's problem , since neither he , nor Emma's sister are willing to lift a finger to help her with the task of parental care . He's humorous , insightful , fraternally malicious and very touchy . The second is Harriet Smith . Very pretty but emotionally immature and haunted by a bad decision prompted by a poor adviser . Toni Collette comes over as a Georgian version of an Orange County whack-job , Samantha Morton tries a bit harder but hasn't got anything to work with . I have no idea what the actress in the ' 72 version thought she was about . Here , there's an edge of incipient self-knowledge , rather than foolishness in her recovery at the dance . A much better interpretation of the character Austen gave us .

People who had seen Simon Callow deliver the role of Mozart on the London stage were distraught at what they saw in the film and Branagh , who was originally cast would also have done a massively better job . Hulce and Berridge were excruciatingly bad as the Mozarts and that's why this movie's rep has died with the hype .

132810702	635556	Re : Title : A Handful Of Dust ?	Don't take anything Christopher Sykes ( or Wikipedia ) says for granted . Sykes himself confessed he couldn't spot the relevance of the Eliot quote . When the word ' ashes ' was changed to ' dust ' , it could have been the bible ' ashes to ashes , dust to dust ' but I'd like to think it was Shakespeare's Cymbeline that Waugh was thinking about . Fear no more the heat o ' the sun , Nor the furious winter's rages ; Thou thy worldly task hast done , Home art gone , and ta'en thy wages ; Golden lads and girls all must , As chimney-sweepers , come to dust Fear no more the lightning-flash , Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone ; Fear not slander , censure rash ; Thou hast finished joy and moan ; To lovers young , all lovers must Consign to thee , and come to dust . A handful of dust is how we all end up . Eliot in his poem is also referring back to the same Shakespearean use of ' dust ' . Since Waugh didn't start out by quoting Eliot , I think it's a coincidence that he ended up by doing so , even though Waugh knew and admired The Waste Land .

But I also think that a large number of Germans , maybe a majority , had spotted where it was going to end up and wanted a leadership that looked less insane to the outside world . Ill-getting your gains is always a lot easier than hanging on to them . And generally ( in business , politics and warfare ) consolidation requires a different crew with a different set of skills . Of course , I'm not saying such a thing was likely or there were a lot of people who would have voted for it . But of all the possible alternatives , it's really the only way the Nazis could have stayed in power as far as the 1960's . Everything else ends in conflagration .
132170216	635556	Re : Completely agree	Davies hasn't much feel for Austen's dialogue . The scenes at Lambton and Pemberley in which he attempted a bit of Austenite irony clank like Victorian plumbing . Letting the author shine through is a tricky business . In ' 95 , every Austen fan was aching for the moment when Mrs Bennet finds out that Lizzie is going to marry Darcy but Davies ' script failed to deliver , having wasted too much time on Lydia's wedding . Sandy's script for Jane Eyre never missed a beat . It included , for example , and for the first time in an adaptation , the vital love scenes between Rosamund Oliver and St John Rivers needed to animate the interlude . The language , while not original was clear and musical . And the script split brilliantly into four episodes with three amazing cliffhangers . Even though its success will depend entirely on one piece of casting , if Sandy's Emma isn't the best adaptation so far , I'll eat my hat - the chocolate one .

143304807	635556	Re : Anglo-American relations	Not , I think , a fully accurate picture . A significant minority of Americans were at least as worried about Fascism and Communism as France and Britiain and would like to have eliminated both . There was even a surprisingly widespread feeling after the Battle of Normandy that the Allies should carry one beyond Germany and finish the job Hitler started , possibly even with German help . And of course , they didn't go home . They stayed in the UK , France and Germany until well into the 90's and you're still never far from an serving American in Mons . The abrupt end of Lend Lease ( and the refusal of a Reconstruction loan ) was Dulles and Truman's way of saying ' It's over . That's your lot . We're going to spend $9B rebuilding Europe and Japan but you Trots are going to pay for your unAmerican welfare state out of your own pockets . ' Not , in context , all that unreasonable , really .
107104911	635556	Re : It's just possible	Add ' supercilious ' and ' arrogance ' to the list of words you need to look up . All I doubted was whether you really understand what a cinematic cliche is . You appear to think that things automatically become cliches the moment they can be compared to half a dozen predecessors and spent quite a lot of time , for example , trying to explain why you think the opening scenes of the Third Man are cliched because you can point to other films that have similar features . This is not a cliche . A cliche is something that has been said and done so often that it has pretty much lost its original meaning or purpose , viz . Sam Goldwyn " What we need are some new cliches " . So it's a 24 carat insult to a film director and totally unjustified in the case of The Third Man's whose opening scenes are so far from cliche that the film's originality can still give people a feeling of disorientation nearly 60 years after it was made . And on one level , Letter to Brezhnev is a tenderly ironic challenge the entrenched western views of the former Soviet Union ( in three of whose new Republics I have worked extensively ) . You seem to be one of the entrenched .

You're an idiot . This is bullying sarcasm , she was the first to sink to it and it deserves a kick in the teeth . You might have felt sympathy with her opening sentiment , but I cannot imagine you expressing it in the same way . As far as LiA goes , it's on your shelf next to Balls of Steel and Meet the Spartans and it's on mine near Shakespeare in Love . Not quite as good , definitely , but in the same class of endeavour , containing intertext with the writer ( SiL was Stoppard ) and plenty of the same class of anachronistically funny witticism , one or two of which , I dare to suggest , you may not have spotted . There are people who hate Chaplin , the Marx Brothers , Benny Hill and Are you being Served ? and I admire the critic who watched Woody Allen play saxophone at Ronnie Scott's and said ' It's the first time he's made me laugh . ' People's sense of humour varies remarkably . There isn't much to be gained from me saying ' this is funny ' and you saying ' no , it's not ' . What is certainly true of Lost in Austen is that the concept has proved itself enough to have generated a certain amount of curiosity and impatience around a proposed sequel and it made a lot of Austen fans laugh . At the time of broadcast , the impatience for the next episode was as high as for any recent period adaptation . To someone who cites Radio 4 as a cultural credential , that should be indication enough that something went right , even if it offended you . Austen fans are just as demanding a demographic as Radio 4 listeners , I reckon .

157813377	635556	Re : What part about FICTION do you not understand ?	As has been made abundantly clear , on numerous occasions , this is not a modest little twist , like Operation Burma . This is like a film which claimed that Royal Marines took Okinawa or the Royal Navy won the Battle of Midway or that the US Navy sank the Bismarck . Since the producers and the writers got the point and went public with their regrets and apologies , the odd nitwit on here should have no difficulty in understanding why a lot of people involved in the actual events got upset , either .
153047556	635556	Re : Tiny little things	A genuine mistake . In the final scene the dialogue is muted as the credits start to roll . Not enough for the eagle-eared subtitle writers who caught Ruth saying ' OK ' and faithfully transcribed it .
149056596	635556	Re : JLM is best Knightley ?	I didn't expect to like him , having seen the trailer , but I do . In fact , I think he's exactly the Knightley ( saucy wink ) I have always imagined . He is , as someone has pointed out , exactly the right age and he has to appeal to Emma . They have to start a seemingly irreconcilable distance apart and come together and they have created the right amount of space and friction for the relationship to grow . Who would you rather go to dinner with ? This Emma and Knightley , or your choice of Elizabeths and Darcys ?
166404689	635556	Re : Negative views of Patton .	It is highly unlikely that Von Runsdtedt said anything of the sort but if it is true then it is a tribute to the magnificent misdirection campaign run by the Intelligence services in the run-up to D-Day rather than anything Patton actually did . Von Runstedt and the German High Command knew little enough about Patton before 1944 and almost everything they learnt afterwards was false or amplified to the point at which it became false . In addition to convincing the German High Command that Patton had an army of invasion strength in East Anglia , they also worked hard on the idea that Patton was fit to command it ( instead of on the beach for _ _ _ _ _ _ _ insert you favourite reason ) . As hotrodder points out , once he was actually campaigning in France , the Germans didn't pay him much attention and he didn't distinguish himself . His hotheaded confidence certainly got him into the wrong place at the wrong time when the Falaise Gap was closing , for example . Ike was the best US General of WW2 . Won the Battle of Normandy , for a kickoff . Couldn't read a battleplan , couldn't read a map but managed the two best Allied field army commanders of the war , Montgomery and Bradley , when no one else could , kept all the peacock feathers of all the other services smoothed flat with their beaks facing forward and never , ever , for one second , lost sight of what was required to win the most important offensive battle in the West , continuous and unimaginably enormous supplies of materiel . The reason the Russians got to Berlin first was it was just too difficult a feat to pull off twice in one year . Still came close though .
164566398	635556	Re : What's with the music bashing ?	There's another long running argument like this one concerning Altman's 1973 Long Goodbye , ( which contains a famous hommage to TTM and a few other nods ) . In that film he uses a few verses of single song played on different instruments and turning up here there and everywhere in different versions as the only source of music in the score . Irritates the hell out of me as its a piece of whiny pseudo-torch nonsense but some people think it's amazingly creative and does all sorts of things for the film . Me , I like use of the zither but not always the use of the volume control .

117816324	635556	Re : Arterton looks too invincible	You're joking aren't you ? There's a passage in the book at the dance where Hardy describes Tess as having the 5 year old in her eyes , the 12 year old in her cheeks and the 9 year old in her mouth . Arterton actually manages to deliver all this . She seems much younger in the carriage when she feels threatened , than she does when she tries to flirt with Angel , and younger still when she has her elocution lesson or her tantrum at home over her father . Her accent is excellent and I love the way she files the corners off her Wessex burr , but then drops the improvement when the pressure gets to her every now and then . She's meant to be fatally attractive to men . Hardy himself was a bit gaga over her . Me too . Bring on the rest . Can't wait for next week .

163303953	635556	Re : If Great Britain had been defeated in World War 2 then what happens ?	Without Britain , the US would simply build a force of intercontinental bombers - the B-36 . Would they not fail just as the force of B17's failed with their bombsights that could drop a bomb in a pickle barrel ( in the Nevada desert with no wind or cloud ) and their almost invulnerable formation air-artillery defence systems and techniques that produced instant and unacceptable losses when deployed in the field ? Germany would have been first to everything technological - arms - transport - ICBMs - computers and so on if Britain had been occupied in 1940 . It was geared that way . And both the USA ( first ) and the British Empire ( second ) would have done a deal with the Third Reich not gone to war with it . Hitler could very well have been tipped out of office before he could start another war with the Soviets and the world would be different .

( though wouldn't have minded living next door to his house in Green Park ) . Not quite what De Gaulle meant . What he intended to convey was that every action of the Free French Government , including any forces it controlled , should only be influenced by French interests , not those of its Allies . And as he defined what was in the French interest , this meant that everyone French should do exactly as he said and not listen to anybody else . A nice distinction simultaneously asserting independence while avoiding the need to acknowledge France's debt to the UK and the USA . This , for example , is why he refused to acknowledge the heroic efforts of Kiefer's commandos on D-Day . Not because they weren't heroes but because they were part of British 4 Commando , guilty of fighting THE war , not HIS war . There's some original film and three of the vets here . http www kewego com video iLyROoafYzBq html You'll hear the De Gaulle slight discussed about 5 minutes in ( after some great clips from 1944 ) .

125620129	635556	Re : The present day framing device . . . .	This is not really an infantile framing device like the military cemetery scene SPR which is supposed to be a response to Hanks ' character's ridiculously sentimental command to Ryan to ' earn ' the sacrifice of his platoon . Rooting Land and Freedom in David Carr's tiny flat in Liverpool gives the drama of his hitherto unknown heroism and the story of the love of his life incredible poignancy as his unsuspecting grandaughter uncovers it one letter , one episode at a time . In fact , it's a cornerstone of the film , which is more of an elegy to all the forgotten soldiers of a forgotten war than a historical or political piece . I love the final scene , as she throws the earth from Blanca's grave into David's , symbolically reuniting the warrior of the past with his heroine and his fallen comrades - a scene that has been attempted over and over again but never carried off so well as here , where it not only reminds us how little is left of the hope that Carr took to Spain but how much courage people were once prepared to personally invest in it .

125837874	635556	Re : Did the Canadians saved the British from losing WWI ? ? ?	It's nice to have all the common misconceptions about Haig collected in one thread . I particularly enjoy the one about him being hundreds of kilometres behind the line eating Tournedos Rossini and drinking Lafite ' 02 in his chateau . Haig mostly ran the war from a train which was always close to the action and was actually reprimanded before becoming CiC for his habit of ' trotting out to take a look ' which nearly got him killed twice on horseback on the Menin Road . He was rarely seen two days together at HQ in Montreuil sur Mer . His presence there was always regarded as a visit . But what we can all thank him for , and what no one else , including Plumer and Monash , would have been able to do , was on the fateful day in late March 1918 , at the height of the defence of Amiens - when Petain decided to split the English and French Armies and fall back on Paris , Haig promptly got him sacked and replaced with Foch . Without his prompt and forceful action , at bets the war would have lasted another two years and at worst , since separating the two armies was the objective of Operation Michael , the Germans could have run a holding operation against the British and thrown all their weight against the French , potentially winning the war in 1918 or early 1919 . Haig is often called politically naive because he didn't care who had what job title . In 1918 , this was politically astute . He was running an Anglo-German conflict in France and his skill as a strategist , tactician and co-ordinator were responsible for its successful outcome .

145714618	635556	Re : Most Overrated General	Juin ? Isn't he the chap who commanded the North African Mountain Troops in Italy ? Attsa one . His ability to fix problems and get on with things amazed the Allies , particularly the Americans in Italy whose open respect and even deference was fatal to his relationship with De Gaulle ( who they despised ) . Juin could not see the problem , for instance , with incorporating his Free French units into the US Fifth Army and simply getting on with winning the war . His winning military record didn't help either . De Gaulle went out to Italy in 1943 to see if some of the shine would rub off on him . Juin ignored him . De Gaulle got fed up and went back to North Africa . Then ignominiously ignored Juin when it came to handing out the credits and the memorials . As he did Kiefer , head of the only French brigade to land on D-Day ( but who were part of British 4 Commando ) . After the war , De Gaulle couldn't easily counterbalance the credit that Juin had earned as he was a prime and senior mover in SHAEF and NATO . But after opposing him over Algeria , De Gaulle ran a successful whispering campaign about him in the press and Juin was forced to resign . The last ever Maréchal de France .

Many of the seamen who defeated the Armada were kept onboard ship where disease decimated them and reduced the payroll . However away from the cannon fodder , most professional soldiers in Tudor times were mercenaries who knew their jobs and were very good at getting paid . £25 a year would have been about right for someone who could shoot a musket and hit something man-sized 25 yards away , one in five times and slice the cork off a bottle with his sword .

119526527	635556	Re : Favourite Hardy - novel and / or adaptation ?	The Return of the Native Tess of the d'Urbervilles The Mayor of Casterbridge Jude the Obscure Far from the Madding Crowd The Woodlanders A Laodicean The Trumpet-Major Under the Greenwood Tree As far as adaptations go , I like this one with its tragic bravura as much as the 98 Tess . Waddell had a bit more of a spring in her step , which wouldn't have hurt in Episode 2 here , but Gemma did the business outstandingly well in Epsiode 4 , though the direction faltered again at crucial moments . And she looked the part . Justine looked a bit too ethereally fragile at times . I enjoyed Keeley Hawes as Fancy in Under the Greenwood Tree and it has a really good chorus of Hardy's peasants in it . And possibly the strongest Wessex flavour of any TV adaptation . In 2003 , Ciaran Hands made a good Henchard but with James Purefoy , Polly Walker and Johdi May the rest should have been better than it was . Direction let it down again . Reading Michael Henchard's will at the age of 14 at the end of a whole day with the book on my knee was a formative experience for me . It's a Greek tragedy . The Schelsinger Stamp / Christie FFTMC seems to get panned a lot . Don't know why . I find it rivetting , especially Finch and Stamp . And the Wessex landscape , so lacking , so often , is triumphantly on screen .
166459747	635556	Re : Taken me 5 viewings to appreciate this outstanding movie .	Actually the actor's egos were a bit of a problem . Cotten refused to allow his character be called ' Rollo ' , as in the script , Selznick edited the American version of the film , taking out all the negative aspects of Martins ' character , getting him to do the opening voiceover to make it more ' noirish ' and Welles was a problem throughout , turning up late on set and refusing to film in the sewers . Part of the film's weight does come from its historical context which , as The Good German painfully illustrates , cannot be recreated with a few bits of original equipment and an execrable imitation of Marlene Dietrich .

It has jarred slightly with me and one or two other fans I know , but we are evidently on our own on the geographical point . But when Waugh himself talked about Brideshead and its milieu , it always seemed to me he was talking about Cliveden or the sort of household we see in Remains of the Day , close to , or in the Home Counties , with its owners keen to operate a salon of partisan political opinion and influence events . Castle Howard doesn't fit the social bill for Brideshead for me . Though in this version , I was a total convert 10 minutes in . And I still think the current producers were ill-advised to choose the same house .

He overstates the argument ( as he always does ) by calling it castration , which is clearly not what Jane wants . But at the end , he is blinded ( so has to see the world through Jane's eyes ) , needs her help to feel through his damaged hands , no longer has any financial advantage and is devoted to the point of wearing the necklace that he bought her . The great secret of what women want , as posed in the question asked by the Wife of Bath back in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales , has an answer . Power and Dominion over their men . Jane has it .

( You have to be VERY alert if you want to squeeze the last drop out of anything in SiL ) I think the whole transformation theme " how do things work ? " / " it's a mystery " is central to all the key themes , men transformed to women , women to men , thugs to actors and gangsters to poets . We have a transformation at the beginning , when Henslowe's tailor turns from stutterer to hero and I still think Fennyman's transformation at the end is intended to complete his journey , though I accept that part of the strength of what he does lies in his detached determination to get the lines out whatever . The end result is a very convincing performance of someone made desperate by a shortage of cash and that's what takes Will by surprise .

It came out after the success of the first Foyle's War series and the two ran together one summer , a while back , each taking an interesting mildly revisionist viewpoint . Monsieur Renard shows that for many French people , especially those living in the Forbidden Zone , a 5km belt along the coast facing the UK , the war actually finished in June 1940 and a new peacetime life began and continued almost until the Invasion . Set in Hastings immediately opposite St Jos on the English side of the channel ( and around where I live ) Foyle's War attempted to show that not everyone on the home front was heroically supporting the war effort . I think you'd like both . As far as general trends in WW2 movie making are concerned , I'm hoping , foolishly no doubt , that inaccurate and sentimentally overwrought heroics like those in SPR , however realistic the historical reconstructions are , may be giving way to more interesting and enlightening views of WW2 . LC & LP isn't part of the trend . It is made from an unusual French viewpoint for 1969 and has masses of primary source material from both French and Germans involved at the time .
142440483	635556	Re : Incriminating pictures of Grigoriev ?	There are two reasons why the burn on Grigoriev is successful . He has been working directly for Karla and has been caught at it . This means no friends at the Embassy , behind whose backs he has been working and a bullet in the head from Karla for giving the game away . And he has been naughty with one of the secretaries which , apart from being naother bad career move , is also going to involve him in a deluge of abuse and nonsense from his wife . The pictures taken with the ' Western Spies ' are the final nail in his coffin , though being thick , it takes him a while to put it all together . It's not really until George draws him a picture of life with no privileges in ' somewhere inclement ' with his harridan , that Grigoriev finally realises his game is up .

134404450	635556	Re : How did this beat Saving Private Ryan for the Oscar ?	It has popcorn dialogue and popcorn plotting . ' Oh no ! ' a young French child is in danger , ' what will our heroes do ?

' Children we don't stop for ' says Yoda , reminding us we are ' borrowing ' from Apocalypse Now . ' Oh no ! ' ' he can't possibly shoot that unarmed prisoner ' , says inexperienced , unlikeable newbie ' it's unAmerican ' . ' Behind enemy lines what else can we do ? ' ' Let him go ' cry the audience ' Let him go ' cries the newbie . ' Something bad will happen ' say the warts as they let him go . LATER , ' Oh the agonising irony - he shot the very man who let him go ' . Cowardly newbie finally steps up to the plate to take care of things . ' Karma it is ' says Yoda . Then we have ' Earn this ' the single most ridiculous line ever written into a war film and guess what . It's the pivot of the plot . Now what ? Down to the last man and the last bullet . What's that sound ? Hooray . The cavalry . It's the famous roar of a Napier Sabre powering an RAF Hawker Typhoon tankbuster , looking uncannily like an American P-51 ( must have had something in my eye at the time ) . Fade out where we faded in . Heroic music . Old Glory fluttering in the wind . I could have found Private Ryan in two hours with a radio and a desk . Anybody could .

153606527	635556	Re : Recommendations	There are two recent Great Expectations . One is updated and has Gwyneth Paltrow as a modern Estella and Robert de Niro as Magwitch and isn't as bad as it sounds and there is a BBC version with Ioan Gruffudd as Pip which suffers from variable casting but is mainly very enjoyable . Ioan Gruffudd also did a Hornblower series built on accurate naval research ( which prompted Master & Commander ) and makes enjoyable Sunday afternoon viewing , though there's a quite a lot of fighting and not much romance .
163306216	635556	Re : If Great Britain had been defeated in World War 2 then what happens ?	I tend to disagree on the might have though we both agree on the impossibility of a successful German invasion of Britain in 1940 . What happened in France in July 1940 was that the War on Continental Europe effectively finished , with Germany the winners and France , Belgium and Holland the losers . The was no more WW2 for the French . They felt that once the war was lost in France it was over , regardless of what Britain did , as evidenced by the many requests for last ditch reinforcement when the the BEF and half the French Army were surrounded in the Dunkirk pocket . Many Frenchmen still regard the war as two wars , one in 1939-1940 that the British and French lost and one in 1944-1945 that the Americans won . Many of the conquered French thought that things would improve after the German invasion . That Hitler would fix all the Communist silliness , re-energise French society and that they would become # 2 in a German-dominated Europe with a French right-wing government with its own right-wing agenda . And they they could march forward into new health and prosperity . If Halifax had done a deal with Hitler and Britain had submitted to a German-led Europe , war would have come anyway . But if Britain had been invaded and conquered , there would , I think , have been a Lite version of what was going on in France as the Germans would quickly realise that Nazification of the British Empire was a non starter . The best German move in this case would have been to let Britain get on with roughly what it was doing with Empire while making a new set of rules for military action and economic strategy . The result of which the USA would have not particularly wanted to interfere with and may even have preferred to what existed before or to a war in Britain's defence . I think a lot of sensible Germans would have wanted , at that point , to quit while they were ahead and another Night of the Long Knives would have resulted in a new set of rather more attractive feathers for the Nazi leadership . Fortunately , the Beatles still come along in the 60's and transform society peaceably so we still end up with the new Daleks and Siobhan Magnus being voted off American Idol 6 episodes too early .
130994783	635556	Re : This movie is a joke	You're too kind . This is the worst Chandler adaptation on film . Have you noticed what happened to the film careers of all concerned afterwards ? Did Elliott Gould ever get a leading role again ? Nope . Sterling Hayden after his abysmal impersonation of Ernest Hemingway ? Disappeared almost without trace . Nina van Pallandt and Mark Rydell ? Condemned to bit parts . Jim Bouton ? Never worked again . Awful . Completely missed the point . Chandler would be doing 6000 rpm in his grave . Gould is as painful as new chalk on a blackboard throughout . The Kurry-brand catfood nonsense , a hippy riff leftover from MASH made me feel positively homicidal towards him and I wouldn't trust myself near him , even today . But what made me squeal out loud in the cinema was the miniature harmonica at the end of the shot that's supposed to be a homage to The Third Man . Cynical , misguided trash . 0 / 10
167000388	635556	Re : The opera after Mozart father's death	Claiming Don Giovanni was based on Moliere's play is a little bit like claiming Verdi's Macbeth is based on Carlo Rusconi's version . Or that Throne of Blood is based on Verdi . The Don Giovanni story was only threads and patches before Molina turned it into a play , which became famouse everywhere except Spain . Years before Moliere took up his pen . Of course it's hard to tell who is ripping off who , when it comes to ' creatives ' but Da Ponte committed his most serious larceny on a version of the opera written just a few months before he started work on his own version . This was based on Moliere but the most significant changes , renaming the heroine to Elvira and turning Don Giovanni into an atheist , were made in the first French versions of Molina's play which Moliere used as his sources . So it depends what you mean by ' based ' . No one can prove that Da Ponte had read anything other than the libretto of Don Giovanni di Tenorio , o sia il convitato de pietra , but all roads lead back to Molina .

149059512	635556	Re : JLM is best Knightley ?	Me too . For me , the way to infuse life into an Austen adaptation is to identify the four or five big scenes between the two leads and try and deliver those intact . If you capture even 80 % of their original impact , everything else will be OK too . Sandy Welch gets this whereas Andrew Davies still doesn't . You'll find yourself thinking " hmmm , I might not have done that myself ' more often with Sandy but you'll care less ( or I do , anyway ) because she's faithful to the characters first and the author second . And it's the characters we love . E1 of P & P95 is a good example of what I mean . The two evenings Elizabeth sounds in the Netherfeld drawing room light the fire as Elizabeth and Darcy emerge as intellectually equal and head and shoulders above their company . But Davies stops both scenes short of any real sparks to cut to Darcy in the bathroom watching Elizabeth play with the dog or walk around the house with her fine embonpoint carefully displayed . Not that I have anything against embonpoints . . .
120094798	635556	Re : uni	Nothing says ' sex ' or ' penetration ' or ' ejaculation ' either . It's a bit inconvenient that Tess got pregnant . Otherwise you could argue that Alec got out his portable backgammon set and gave her a good thrashing . Or converted her into a Everton supporter ( which would have been more of a catastrophe ) . Hardy couldn't be explicit . You have to follow the trail of evidence . If Tess gave in , then Alec wasn't guilty of anything . Tess was guilty of murdering someone who had committed no crime against her and Tishbite and The Furies could all have stayed at home watching America's Next Top Model . It makes absolutely no sense in an ' Aesychlean ' tragedy , which , as we see throughout and explicitly at the conclusion , is where Hardy is aiming .

132074088	635556	Re : How did this beat Saving Private Ryan for the Oscar ?	Three things you should know , grasshopper . 1 . " Earn this " is the most offensively sentimental line ever inserted in to a war movie and SPR deserves to be banned for it . No soldier would ever say anything remotely that ridiculous to another . 2 . The whole shoot - release - get - shot - by - shoot Steamboat Willy is the second most ridiculous plot strand ever to appear in a war movie not featuring John Wayne or Arnold Schwarznegger . And 3 . the " Yes madam , I'll gladly give up my life to help your child " tableau made everyone I know want to throw up . SIL is a movie for grown ups who've had an education . There - I've said it . Occasionally we give in to the urge to strike back .
153998478	635556	Re : Excellent historical investigation	De Gaulle was a petulant , chauvinist ingrate who absolutely did not care what happened to any of his ' Allies ' and sublimated every interest to what he perceived as the French interest . " France has no interests outside France " . He was quite happy to throw a spanner in any of the works if he felt impugned or insulted ( he tried to remove the French liaison officers after they embarked with their D-Day assault units because he felt slighted over the role of French soldiers in 4 Commando - Churchill ordered him to be taken instantly to North Africa " in chains if necessary " as he thought Patton or Monty would kill him if it came out ) . All over the place but seldom around when there was any trouble he told American journalists in 1940 that the British were worse than the Nazis and told British journalists that the Americans were the armies of satan . He was known in France as TinTin , continued to make almost as much trouble after the war ended as he had while it was being fought and was thrown out into the long grass at the end of 1946 . His impact on France during the Occupation is overrated and his reputation is mostly dependent on his political career after France turned to him after the North African colonies fought their way loose .

The interesting questions about this film are not how unlikely it is that someone in Italy might live to be 100 , since lots of Italians with their healthy diets , warm winters and daily exercise do live for decades after their 70th birthday . The interesting questions are things like ' Does it deserve its rep as one of the best films of the 20C ?

120100497	635556	Re : Angel	Perhaps , sausageandbun , it's because you're not sufficiently acquainted with the works of Dr William Acton , who died long before Tess was written . An authority on masturbation and dangers of prostitution to public health , I think I know which side he'd come down on though . For Tess to be a tragedy , ( and Hardy would not cite Aesychlus if he did not intend it to be so ) she has to be more sinned against than sinning . If she is Alec's willing partner in Part 1 , none of the rest makes much sense unless Tess is a villainess finally getting her come uppance for running away from her responsibilities and misleading the innocent Angel Clare . The idea that Alec is guilty of nothing more than being a pest , to whom Tess finally succumbs makes no sense in the context of the novel , in the context of Hardy's other fictional work , in the context of his poetry , his essays or the interviews he gave . It can only be supported , as it has been here , by avoiding the issue of what it written in the final chapter of Part 1 , selectiviely focussing on what happens afterwards , hauling in judiciously selective quotes from all over and citing neanderthals like Sutherland .

Well yes , I can base my assessment of national wealth on anything I like and most methods won't produce results as inaccurate as dividing the calculated GNP by someone's estimate of the population based on electoral rolls and Social security numbers . This is a highly exclusive exercise in the US . You can't tell me that those busloads of Mexicans who appear in Palo Alto at 4 : 30 and are bussed out again at 7 : 00 having tidied the citizen's gardens are counted in there . And the US used to be committed to wealth redistribution and community not so very long ago . LBJ and Carter would seem quite left wing if they were practising politicians in the UK today . My very strong guess is still that a much higher percentage of people in Denmark can afford a new car than in the US . And everyone in Denmark has access to college education , high quality free health care and dozens of other civic benefits , all of which you will have to put on your own tab back in the US when you assess your tax profile . But you're right , you can't have this discussion without respect for actual data and lots of it . Too many people seem to look for it on flagpoles , these days .

Risk-free , formulaic movie making produces risk-free , formulaic movies . The music in TTM is remarkable and original . For some years after the film came out , restaurants in LA would play just 7 notes from the score to announce the arrival of Orson Welles . There are a few films like this , but not many - If , by Lindsay Anderson and the brilliantly off the wall Carl Orff score from Badlands - which come anywhere close to that level of distinctiveness , where just a note or two will identify the soundtrack .

As far as using the word goes , it's actually an American invention rather than a French import , though a French critic was the first to use it , it got taken up by American critics and then re-imported . ' Films noirs ' or even ' Filmes noires ' would be the technically correct French plural . So ' Films noir ' is a pretentious abomination ( I don't care how many Profs in film school disagree ) and here in good old English ' Noirs ' ' Noir films ' and even ' Film Noir films ' are all correct usage . I'd just go for ' Noir films ' , myself since ' Film Noirs ' is more than a bit ugly .

156289345	635556	Re : Do Americans really not have passports ?	Now we can see is right to be dismissive about the data . The Economist pointed out that when the charts were published three years back and Ireland came second , it merely demonstrated how good the Irish were at dodging the tax system . Similarly there are millions of low-waged people living in the US who aren't taken into account . You can see that Denmark and Sweden are wealthier countries than the UK or the US just by walking around it . Top quality public transport everywhere , no city slums , no visible underclass , well-dressed , well-heeled population going about its business in shiny new cars . These states are much smaller and , theoretically at least , easier to manage . Far more of their dollar goes on their health and their environment .

Very specialist job with lots of lives depending on it . There were no dog fights at night . The Mosquito night fighters did not support the bomber formations . They used to hang around German airfields and try to pick off the German night fighters as they landed or took off .

38110895	635556	Re : NEW Mansfield Park adaptation coming next autumn !	Edmund is altered a bit to suit Hugh Grant's talent ( or lack of it if you prefer ) . Willoughby is reasonably faithful portrayal , but Margaret is a bit of a comic indulgence , I'll grant you . However , it is faithful in tone and style and reveals everywhere a respect and understanding for Austen's humour and concerns that isn't present in Davies ' P & P . The dialogue in S & S sounds like Austen even though much of it isn't . The bits of dialogue that Davies invents , such as the clumsy attempts at dramatic irony in Lambton , stick out liek a sore thumb .

161681941	635556	Re : superb directing and screenwriting - did you notice . . .	I think the unusual start ( there is an unusual start to her adaptation of Jane Eyre ) was a gamble designed to illustrate the insecurity of early 19C family life to newcomers and wilfully detach dedicated Austen fans from their comfort zone from the opening seconds , both of which worked triumphantly . It instantly drew parallels between the lives of Emma , Jane and Frank ( and , more subtly , Harriet ) which are at the core of the book and completely absent from any other adaptation . A very , very clever trick for which some purists have yet to forgive her . But not this one . Once you have adjusted your goggles , this adaptation hits new heights for the whole genre and becomes an unalloyed pleasure .

163543971	635556	Re : If Great Britain had been defeated in World War 2 then what happens ?	It would have destroyed a significant part of it How ? And more importantly , if Britain and Germany had decided the war was over , why ? I was writing of LINEBACKER IIExcuse me , but you weren't . You implied that their use changed circumstances and brought the Vietnamese to the negotiating table . You've now weakened your own case as negotiations started in Paris in 1969 , though I could strengthen it up again by saying that opposition to the bombing in the USA ( Hey , hey , LBJ ! How many kids did you kill today ? ) was claimed to be a big part of Kissinger's reason for opening the secret talks . Whatever number you care to put on numbers of non-combatants killed by indiscriminate bombing , it will be measured in thousands or tens of thousands a month - large and unacceptable , as well as being strategically and tactically pointless . There simply weren't enough targets to make it worthwhile . To be effective , the bombing campaign would have had to stretch into China and Russia . Wars are won , lost or drawn in the field - despite whatever happens at negotiating tables or whatever paper you subsequently attempt to paste over the actuality . This was not a draw . Like Germany in WW1 , the USA lost this war in the field . Coming back on topic , they were not able to use their nuclear arsenal in Vietnam as it would have provoked a nuclear response . For the same reasons , they would not have been able to use nuclear weapons in a war with Europe in the mid to late 40's . The smallest threat or hint of it would have lined up everyone against it . There is no post-war US Empire and supercop role outside the Americas without its enormous contribution to the Allied victory against the Nazis .

160476517	635556	Re : The Simple Fact Is . . .	Let's start with thing one . American neutrality ended with The Destroyers for Bases Agreement of September 1939 , which traded 99 year leases on a selection of UK bases , and the complete technical drawings of the magnetron ( the heart of radar ) for 50 flush deck , WW1 spec destroyers many of which , contrary to popular British belief , fought through the whole war , some in the Atlantic theatre . By the time the ink was dry on the agreement , the ' British ' ( actually The Allies - America joined The Allies it didn't invent them ) had effectively ended any prospect of a German invasion without any transatlantic help whatsoever . The Battle of Britain , one of the four most significant military encounters of the war in Europe was over and Germany had lost it . The DFBA agreement was largely symbolic as it counteracted the effect of the USA's Neutrality Acts which stated that materiel had to be supplied for cash to combatants . In fact , at this stage , the USA had been arguably more helpful to the Germans . Some Americans , like , Joe Kennedy and Alexander C Kirk certainly did more damage than other neutrals , leading Hitler to believe that he could always make a deal with the USA if he could just make himself invulnerable on the Continent . The actual Lend-Lease Act didn't pass through Congress until March 1941 , from which point the USA was effectively in a quite different war to the one one Britain was fighting in 1940 . Germany treated the USA as a combatant from this point . America declared War formally on 11 December 1941 but it could no longer really call itself neutral in the Swiss or Irish sense after the DFBA and was involved in anti-submarine warfare against Germany throughout the second half on 1941 . Anyway , we can look elsewhere for example of damage The British ' Ilse ' had done to Germany before 1942 for example in Africa , or the defeat of the German Surface Fleet . But you have picked 1942 because that is when you are dating America's entry into the war . which like your other contentions , is wrong . America declared War formally on 11 December 1941 but it could no longer really call itself neutral after the DFBA . So you could improve your own argument by improving your own analysis of what the USA contributed which , looked at strategically and apart from the activities of a few right wing diplomats and industrialists , was almost immeasurably large from the get-go . There was no security for the Third Reich while England was unoccupied unless there was a concrete agreement between it and the USA . By making it apparent that this would never happen , the USA invalidated Hitler's strategy of invading Western Europe . Before anyone in the US military had fired a bullet .

One which is mentioned a lot here is Idi Smotri , Come and See , a film which you have to prepare yourself for and which tackles the banality of the evil which resulted in 40 million deaths in the small triangle formed by Berlin , Moscow and Kiev and allows the audience to see and experience it without any romantic overlays . I don't think anyone's mentioned Dr Strangelove , apologies if so , but it has the best claim , in my view , to actually changing the way people viewed the Cold War . After it came out , you didn't hear the argument about ' nuclear weapons make the world a safer place ' after it came out and everyone who wanted to stop their escalation knew they were right .

150826148	635556	Re : Can I be the only person here who . . .	> > > but I'll be clear if you like : I don't need you to be clear or clearer . I need you to stop assessing whether I'm intelligent enough to have positive response to LiA . I doubt you're qualified and you certainly don't have enough evidence . It's insulting to me and the very intelligent corps of LiA supporters hereabouts . Stephen Hawking is a huge fan of Red Dwarf and the Vicar of Dibley . A former head of the English Faculty at Cambridge University thinks that Last of the Summer Wine is TV's greatest achievement . Would you feel it necessary to indulge in these recitals were you discussing these shows with them ? I hate the VoD . Does that make me more or less intelligent than SH ? I'd like it if you referred to my earlier post again . All you've taken out of it is the points about humour , and I don't believe that's all that was under discussion . I think humour is the central issue here . No one is confusing LiA with Chekhov . First , your particular argument about humour and its relationship to the masses is correct to a degree , but would not be tolerated if transplanted to other contexts . Ask anyone who has been up on a stage in front of 100's of people why this is so . Comedy is the only artistic medium with instant , qualitative feedback . In the world of public speaking and Powerpoint presentations , for example , is there anything more certain to hold the attention of an audience than humour ? Or anything less successful than failed humour ? Or anything more diffcult to pull off ? Politicians must be good if people vote for them . Now there's a joke I have spotted . Moreover , there is a world of difference between a single joke and a comedic narrative . . and a television comedy series . The authors we mentioned are humourists . Saki and Gibbons have not translated to the screen Wodehouse has . TV and the sitcom has extended comedic tradition and LiA does not have to conform to the same narrative standards . They nature of comdic narrative has changed in a big way . Otherwise everyone who made you laugh in print would be able to do it on the screen . > > > The punt joke is very clever . I took it to pieces to demonstrate why . But you didn't demonstrate why - you told me how it worked , not how it was clever . You didn't find it funny because you ( self-confessedly ) missed the three admittedly arcane but separate threads of allusion , to Cambridge pomposity and eccentricity and Oxford's fondness for tradition and the context of the humorously bitter rivalry between the two places . You interpret this as winking at me from the stage and call it unskilful . I could interpret it as you not paying enough attention . Neither opinion matters in the least as it's a very good joke which still tickles people who hear for the first time . The humour in it lies in the context and the skill . Failing to appreciate the former still leaves room to appreciate the latter but not , it seems , in your case . Not unless you have a different understanding of the word ' evident ' to myself . And obligingly you provide me with two easy examples : > > > ' let's have 25 children and name the all Amanda , even the boys ' - > > > ' I'm decorating . It's what single woman my age do . It's like sex only you can stop for a cup of tea . ' These are , at best , amusing . I'm glad you find them funny , though - as you say , I can't say they're not funny if you laugh at them , so I can't argue with that . And I'm certainly not trying to deprive anybody of entertainment . But clever ? How is self-consciously populating somebody else's line with your own references clever ? Perhaps I'm just getting old , but I heard stuff like this , and got over it , while I was still at university - which was not a recent event . In fact , about ten years ago a television programme had an item on it called ' Lazy Comedy Slags ' , in which two stand up comedians dissected what they considered grating , obvious and lazy comedic devices as used by performers who had failed to distinguish themselves by doing anything new , and simply wallowed in old devices that were older than their mothers-in-law , rather than attempting to do anything new . In particular they referred to the the ' . . . and then I got off the bus ' joke . That's your ' even the boys ' line . The other line is another lazy repetition - it's our old friend , the ' It's like sex but . . . ' joke . Without even thinking about it I can tell you that in 2006 a BBC TV show with no connection to Austen used the line " Ever killed anyone . . ? You're missing out - it's like sex , only there's a winner " . I think you have misunderstood the ' off the bus ' joke construct , which belongs to those unfunny post-modernist comedians who thought any stream of consciousness could be rendered funny with disconnected , catch-phrase-style last line . Alexei Sayle is very good on this subject . However , I quite like repopulating well known formulae . Perfectly legitimate . Needs skill to get a laugh out of it though . I can come up with something earlier than your 2006 reference . Aristophanes uses it in Lysistrata about 2006 years ago . Comparing unrelated things to sex is as old as the written word . Making it funny and finding something new , like makeover shows and shading it with a commentary on modern life that will have some relevance to a time travel drama is all that's required to get a laugh . Still takes skill . So , why are you impressed by these lines ? I'm unimpressed simply because I've heard them before . No you haven't . You just watch enough comedy to make you think you have . Even to have that effect on people the material has to be good enough to incite comparison . This reflex is linked to the one that leads you to believe you were anticipating Darcy in the fountain . It's possible , I suppose , that you were . More likely that you convinced yourself you were after the fact because you thought it too obvious a connection with Colin Firth . > > > and the actors positively do not tee these up to cue the audience . I will certainly agree with this . I could add that it's worth bearing in mind that since they don't have an audience that was never going to be on the agenda anyway , but I think I'd be doing the cast a disservice . There are some performances here that are certainly better than those in the 1995 version - I'd love it if we could swap Alex Kingston with Alison Steadman ! And Hugh Bonneville is rather typecast here but no more so than Benjamin Whitrow , and with a much more interesting end product . I wondered what kept you watching ! I certainly think the production team had a better feel for one of the central themes of Austen's work . Women who felt themselves forced into marriages with the likes of Collins were much more likely to end up with the quotient of happiness of LiA's Jane , than with Andrew Davies ' Charlotte . > > > So we're only left with the debate as to whether it is funny or not . No , we're not . That's entirely beside the point , Nope , noe and thrice noe . It is the entire point . and the grounds on which you say it is funny are , as you are aware , sufficient to bestow the title of genius on Ernest Goes To Camp and Morons From Outer Space . Now who's being elitist ? There is clearly an audience for this type of dreck but we're not in it . But there's nothing wrong with feeding it , apart from the fact that it distracts money that we'd rather see spent elsewhere . I would prefer to see a hypothetical budget for a new series of the Vicar of Dibley spent on another version of LiA with perhaps another novel being used . I'd expect a few brickbats , though . I think we both know that there is more to it than this , and that comedy drama is not a field where criticism can only be made based on popularity . Humour is tricky . > > > Did it make people laugh ? Yes it did . Did it make enough people laugh ? Yes it did . It must be funny then . Fine . But is it * GOOD * ? That's a different matter , though related , and one I hoped you would address rather than running for the subjectivity bunker . Is it a sharply observed , enlightening , humorous analysis of two societies , hundreds of year apart ? No . Does it have important things to say about the nature and longevity of popular classics ? No . Does it cast new light on familiar characters and situations and make us think a bit harder about a key literary text than Andrew Davies and Joe Wright did ? Definitely . Is it funny ?

98797107	635556	Re : Tiny little things	Oh , I never noticed him offering his handkerchief ! Thanks for pointing that out , it gives me an excuse to watch it again . It's my favourite ' tiny little thing ' . I love that it's just a fleeting moment , shot from behind - so signficant and yet so easy to overlook . Based on this , I remember arguing with some fans of the ' 83 series , when the board was young , that Toby and Ruth could convey more emotion with their backs to camera than Zelah and Timothy could manage in the whole ' 83 series but imdb probably improved things when they deleted that one !
123409695	635556	Re : What key does she Sing ' I want To Hold Your hand ' in ?	Yep . One of the best performances in the film .

I love the fleeting raspy gravelly notes she can start or finish a phrase with .

117840822	635556	Re : The ' Independent ' review gets it right�	Agree it's a big issue . But I don't accept that it wasn't rape . Hardy meant every word and continually underlined the importance of his subtitle . There's no exculpation for Alec's crime in the book , just a little more to forgive Tess for than is immediately explicit . I think it's right to keep the scene in the forest in less than perfect focus but that's a far cry from assuming there was consent from Tess .
162273040	635556	Re : Cats and Dogs	A good thought . There are definitely autobiographical incidents the chime with Chandler's lifestyle before he took up the pen , but on the whole , Wade is a picture of the successful Hollywood work - from - home - live - in - the - valley creative non-creative that Chandler despised . You'll never get me down on one side of the Hammett / Chandler fence or the other as I think they are both amongst the best 20C American writers . Hammett took crime out of the library and put it into the gutter , where most of it belongs . Chandler integrated it and was the first to latch onto and portray its systemic place in modern American culture . Chandler's prose can occasionally wander but mostly it is a crisp , economic prototype which has had a lasting influence on most American writers who came after him ( this was what I used to justify my somewhat off-piste selection of authors - picking up echoes of Hammett Chandler in Salinger , Heller , Bellow and Roth and so on )
150597924	635556	Re : JLM is best Knightley ?	Paltrow and Northam are my least favourite pairing . I quite like JN as an actor but he doesn't have a great deal of range and neither does Paltrow and they didn't intersect much at all , almost as if they were in two different productions and Toni Collette was truly awful in her brainless nutter turn . I find it quite hard to watch . Getting characters to spark off each other in big , dialogue-based set pieces is quite hard but you can't have a really successful Austen adaptation without pulling it off . The P & P95 production had very little of it between the leads but managed , bizarrely , to deliver it in spades between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine . This adaptation delivers it where it matters , between the two leads and thats ' where its attractions mainly lie . Scores 9 . 5 / 10 in my book .
157549020	635556	Re : I want to discuss the reason why Mr . Knightley is envious of F Churchill	Frank behaves badly throughout the story .

Mrs Churchill is yet another female in search of a male heir . How many of us would risk losing her millions ( by today's standards ) to please a father who had rejected us ? His big mistake was not taking Emma into his confidence .

54063415	635556	Re : What's the biggest insult ? ? ?	Neither are really insulting , I think , since both show a huge gulf in class . RoPP is miserable fare . The best moments of Martin's performance can only remind you of moments from the Seller's originals which outshine them by miles . The worst just emphasise what a difference there is between a great comic actor and a comedian doing his best without too much real acting talent . Similarly , the LaDoPS shows throughout that although Geoffrey Rush is a very fine actor and Sellers impersonator , there are still light years between his imitations and Sellers ' own performances on screen .
152646643	635556	Re : What a pathetic lie of a movie	U-571 , for the umpteenth time , is based on the capture of U-110 by HMS Aubretia in 1941 . Only three subs were actually successfully boarded in the whole war . The character played by McConachey is based on RN Sub-Lieutenant David Balme ( still with us ) who spent two weeks consulting with the producers and David Ayer and met McConachey and Keitel AND thoroughly enjoyed himself AND saw the film twice . Although he enjoyed himself , his comrades and the inhabitants of Horsforth , who raised the money to pay for the Aubretia were not at all impressed . Understandably . There are dozens of other historical inaccuracies and misunderstandings in U571 BUT removing the credit of an historical action from one service and handing it to another is unacceptable . The juxtaposition , in having American sailors capture U571 to retrieve the Enigma , is no different in quality or scale to having them sink the Bismarck . This is what U-571 screenwriter David Ayer said after the film came out : - Ayer told BBC Radio 4's The Film Programme that he " did not feel good " about suggesting Americans captured the Enigma code rather than the British . " It was a distortion . . . a mercenary decision to create this parallel history in order to drive the movie for an American audience , " he said . US screenwriter Ayer revealed his grandparents were involved in World War Two . " Both my grandparents were officers in World War Two , and I would be personally offended if somebody distorted their achievements , " he told presenter Chris Tookey " I met with the Royal Navy officer who actually went down into the U-boat and recovered the Enigma machine in 1941 . " He seemed OK with it , he was a great guy , but I understand how important that event is to the UK , and I won't do it again , " he added .
166389276	635556	Re : Was I the only one that found this film to be terrible ?

126372071	635556	Re : The Cold War was ridiculous	The Cold War probably held up the Iron Curtain 30 years longer than necessary . No one knew Stalin was going to die in 1952 , but once he was gone , Russia's ambitions to submit the world to communism pretty much died with him . The game of Global Balance of Power which ensued and became the cold war did absolutely nothing for anyone's security , as anyone who lived through the 1963 missile crisis can attest . ( Imagine what would have happened if Dubya and Cheney had been in charge then ) . The idea that nuclear proliferation made the world a safer place is , singly , the most misguided idea in human history .
126368890	635556	Re : is blueray necessary ?	It doesn't much matter who scans what at what resolution . In the scanning game it seems at first obvious that the higher the resolution the better rendition of the original grain you end up with . But it's not necessarily true . You can get grain shadows and introduce things that aren't there on the original neg that have to be removed . Still , it's a good rule of thumb to scan as high as you can , that way you're sure you have everything . However , rather than mentioning archiving , what I should have said is that at 25fps , the amount of information you can get onto 150 minutes worth of 35mm frames of high density black and white film , using whatever filmstock , lenses and processing technique you like can be adequately resolved and stored on a Bluray disk .

158441310	635556	Re : historically inacurate movie	Since they did not have an interest in India any more , they could not have been for or against partition . As daft an equivocation as I have ever seen . The British and Congress were both strongly against partition and taken by surprise at the rapid growth of the assumption that it was inevitable . Once the timetable to independence had been set to ' as fast as possible ' there was no time to deal with the demand for partition by attempting consensus . Gandhi was partly to blame for that , assuming that everyone shared his vision of an independent India and the only problem was removing the British . All that was left was to draw the line as uncontroversially as possible then sign independence into law by a British Act of Parliament . Which requires one signature . Before the Signature Act , it didn't require any signatures at all .
151952832	635556	Re : The Brilliance of this series	Seemed to reset the boundaries for what TV drama could achieve at the time . I remember the whole country was in shock after Yosser's story and the massed ranks of critics and reviewers all ganged up against it because they simply didn't understand its truth . Possibly because of this , it was an example unfollowed until The Wire - a very worthy successor with broader vision , a more understanding group of producers and a much bigger canvas .

156019738	635556	Re : Do Americans really not have passports ?	My point is that it's the couple of weeks rather than the $6K . You can't do Europe in 2 weeks , any more than you can do the US in three days . You need to organise and for that you need to really want to go in the first place . Most people don't bother travelling long distances for the pleasure of it , wherever they are from . And it's easier if you're young . I reckon 20 times as many current UK students have been to the Australia and New Zealand as had when I went to uni . Wouldn't surprise me if the same were true about American students and Europe .

Half 2001's fans , including me , can see the metaphors but still have no idea what most of it is really about , which is part of the enjoyment . I only watch it in bits these days anyway . What I like most about Gosford Park ( and look at the actors who signed up - Derek Jacobi down there a # 24 with Richard E Grant below him ) is that Altman's mystery film with no mystery works very much like MASH , his war film with no war . Like the Enigma Variations , it makes you think very hard about its theme and purpose without ever being explicit . You can get more done that way . One of the best books on communism written in 20C never uses the words ' communism ' or ' politics ' .

20834750	635556	Re : movie vs novel	Well there you go . I think Rozema is an utter nightmare for an Austen script . On her commentary , she reveals her ignorance of context , the themes , the relative importance of the characters , her misunderstandings of the importance of the key relationships ( how else could she overlook Mrs Norris and leave out William Price ) and most of all her complete blindness to the central concept of Mansfield Park , stupidly dilapidated in the film , as the cornerstone of nature , civilisation and manners . Love for Jane Austen ? Get real . She's driven a bulldozer through everything that Austen stands for and tried to incorporate in her best novel . It's not a bad film , but it should be called something else and the characters renamed . No one would even recognise it as Austen then . Georgette Heyer more like

The WHOLE point about Farlan and his reasons to be prejudiced is that P & P have set them up to be counterpointed , immediately and totally , by Livesey's choice of a jury of Americans . One of the core themes of this film is how prejudice and intolerance can be overcome in moments by simple doses of enlightenment ( see also A Canterbury Tale and Asquith's The Way to the Stars ) . No two distinct nations were ever closer than Britain and the US in WW2 . Ask anyone who was around at the time .

159199021	635556	Re : Why has F . Murray Abraham had such a lackluster career ?	I can't think of any other actor who could have done what he did in that film , All of the performances in the film are , to osme extent , replicas of the original stage performances . Paul Scofield is the definitive Salieri . Abraham deserved his Oscar but the undoubted quality of his performance was heightened by the shortcomings of the rather more slender talents of Hulce and Berridge . With Simon Callow , Felicity Kendall and Scofield in the lead roles , Amadeus was a more ferocious , much more thrilling tragedy .

119525452	635556	Re : Final episode thoughts	Well we got off to a great start , lost our way in the middle but put in a tremendous spurt at the end to carry the day . As for Tess , I can't add much to the two reviews already in this thread since I agree with almost everything in shirley's post . I think the 98 series shaded it overall . You can't have a fully successful adaptation of Tess without some sparky chemistry between Angel and Tess and there was very little in this . I don't think it was all Redmayne's fault . Names are important in Hardy , nowhere more so than in Tess , I think the direction called for a performance which while paying heed to the obvious connotations of his christian name also explored the fact that Hardy named him after an epitome of womanliness and St Francis ' first follower .

136679352	635556	Re : 1979 Tess ' flaws '	Great review . Susan Birtwhistle of P & P95 fame says she writes up every scene in a novel on a card with a summary of what makes it important , then chooses half a dozen which are essential and from which almost nothing can be dropped . The death of Prince , is one of the six , for me . In the dark , in the forest , Tess asleep , the great central shaft of the post cart penetrating Prince's chest resulting in his death - killed by a bystander not by the wound , it is all a metaphor for what happens on The Chase at the end of Part 1 as well as Tess's Oedipal , fateful chance meeting at the crossroads which sets her on her tragic path . And the French countryside and architecture is . . . . what's the word I'm looking for - French .
155785034	635556	Re : Which version would you go for ?	I still say the best adaptation of a Hardy novel to date is Michael Winterbottom's 1996 version of Jude the Obscure , " Jude " , with Christopher Eccleston and Kate Winslet . This film captures the tone and impetus of Hardy's vision more successfully than any other adaptation . There's certainly a lot to admire but its choking climax isn't for every period drama fan . When things are tragic AND well done , they can be a bit hard to watch . Ellie Kendrick as Ann Frank , for example . Brilliant but not something you'd want to watch often . I quite like the surefooted cinematography and direction of the Polanski film but its pastoral flavour is more Balzac than Hardy . I like Justine and Gemma almost equally , they're so different while still both being Tess . For example , the two scenes where Angel returns in Sandbourne are massively different , yet I can't choose between Waddell's hunted gazelle and Arterton's trapped victim of a malign Fate . They're both right and they're both beautiful . Best get ' em both .

I refer you to D H Lawrence's Study of Thomas Hardy .

164567296	635556	Re : Questions about the characters financial situation	What if something else happened to deplete their principal ? What would become of them then ? This is what was happening to them . When moved out of their home by whoever inherited and dispossessed them would be unlikely to buy them an annuity , which would fix their income as Miss Bates was still quite young ( ' Everyone always lives forever when there is an annuity ' - S & S ) . They would have provided them with a capital sum for their maintenance , off which they would be forced to live . Interest was around 4 % , so £1 , 000 would produce a servant's wage of £40 a year . They could not live off this without further assistance with food and rent bills . Every expense , such as a new pair of spectacles , had Frank been unable to fix them , would reduce their capital and therefore their income . Robert Martin's house ( which he rents from Knightley as part of the farm ) would probably be worth between £1 and £2 million on today's market if it were in a nice rural county like Devon or Kent ( more like £5M if it's inside the M25 in the Esher area ) . But his nett income would be less than half what Elton got as Vicar of Hartfield ( before any of his own income was taken into account ) . No carriages for Harriet , though if Robert did the right things and planted the right crops one might come in time and her kids might go to a posher school than Robert did . The Coles , if Mr Cole were a successful business man , would be the most visibly wealthy people in Highbury by the 1820's and may have bought a smart new property or two close to the John Knightleys in London before too long . They'd soon be bored showing off their improvements . Trading generated cash . Land did too but in smaller quantities , on a more evolutionary scale and the wealth lay in the possession rather than exploitation . The Coles grandchildren were likely to be significantly more wealthy than Emma's . But their parents would have had much more risky business to negotiate .

Here in England the delectable prospect of cutting the wastrel Scottish loose and getting rid of the whingeing Welsh keeps being trawled across our nostrils and tantalisingly whipped away . We might even be able to cut Cornwall loose .

160628729	635556	Re : Yet another reason to hate the iPad : Rupert Murdoch loves it	The iPhone was the watershed because it sold the idea of handheld devices running apps to the masses . It got the concept of the PDA-phone out from the pioneers and into the hands of the broad consumer electronic market by fuelling the idea with a forest of simple apps which had true and wide appeal . Blackberries did nothing that the PDA's that came before them couldn't do , they merely relieved the user of the need to understand how set up a POP account on a domain with a simple piece of sofwtare engineering and a rapacious billing method . The iPhone changed all that , got the PDA-phone across the chasm that separates early adopters from the majority by getting the ergonomics right . Just as 90 % of portable computers are currently used for browsing , so 90 % of home computers were used for games in the 80's . The console came along and the Spectrums and Ataris disappeared . The iPad is such a step forward . It's just one of those products that come along every now and then that people don't understand until the market shakes itself out and explains it to them .
89786946	635556	Re : Why's he so overlooked !	Rio Ferdinand was exceptional in the last two world cups . He did not make one single mistake in either tournament . The funniest thing I have ever read on imdb . Ferdinand , playing in advanced positions with Terry was a substantial part of the problem with the relationship between Gerrard and Lampard in midfield and a substaial part of the reason for England's lack of shape and poor results . He's still a problem , now . King's reading of the game is so bad it is occasionally non-existent . The porosity of Spurs defence since he arrived is at least partly down to him . In particular he is a very poor judge of second ball , which is no doubt why Henry likes to play against him so much . Carragher is a much better tackler and much better at marshalling his defence , so much so that , although , when Liverpool have the ball Gerrard is captain , he takes over when the opposition have the ball . Carragher's performance in the second half and extra time in Istanbul 2005 has never been bettered by any English defender and I have been a season ticket holder at Anfield for 32 years . Serious question , did you not watch the world cups or are do you not know very much about football ? Like almost everyone else on the Internet , you need to look up the word ' insult ' in the dictionary and stop passing them off as something else .

155765731	635556	Re : Look Britain , check it out .	Yep , we're ready when you are . For the last 800 years England has only been interested in Ireland and Scotland as they both provide an open back door to the French and the Spanish and anyone else who wants to stir up trouble . The Irish and the Scots have both been willing and eager to invite England's enemies ashore any time they feel like fighting . Now that pan-European institutions have pretty much brought an end to that threat , you can both be off any time you like .
117749048	635556	Re : Read the book . . .	I think close attention is required . When her mother says " Any woman would have asked him " she means " Any woman in your condition " . Due to the morality of the time , Hardy was less than explicit about the fact that Tess and Alec did it more than once and Tess spent nine months in the village as an unmarried mother . The BBC are not making things any more explicit and are going along at a much faster pace .
91306726	635556	Lisa Dillon	I really admire her work in this . She's surrounded in every scene by characters played by household names with far more experience than her , she has little of interest in her corner of the plot ( she's the narrator in the book ) and yet not only is she holding her own , there would be a huge hole in this production without her . She's been a wonderful foil for Dench and Atkins and is anchoring Cranford as the harbour of perspective and common sense . I'll be looking out for more of her stuff , not that there's too much available yet .

153853764	635556	Re : Christmas Cranford . . . . .

The Lord Septimus swindle went for nought , his camp Italian partner didn't open his mouth , the Buxton's remained on a branch line and the plot flopped about like a herring catch . It will , of course , all come together in Episode 2 when the ladies discover what Mary Smith is writing and the increasingly wonderful Jodie Whittaker spreads her wings . We are , perhaps , over-anticipating after a 2 year lay-off . It is Cranford , after all .

150686188	635556	Re : Francophobia in Cranford .	I have worked extensively in both countries and the are very few bits of Franco or Anglo phobia that take me by surprise , whether it be the notion cherished by some that there were French pilots in the Argentinean planes that sank British ships in the Falklands war ( absolute rubbish ) or by others that Churchill used the French resistance as his mouthpiece to Hitler ( also absolute rubbish ) . The French and the English are like any near neighbours looking over each other's garden fence . In terms of population , London is France's 4th largest city and , of course , there are parts of France that seem to have been converted to Surrey ( Le Touquet ) and Dorset ( the Dordogne ) for the benefit of English residents . I was once fortunate enough to have a Paris posting and had to be dragged home kicking and screaming . In the mid 1840's , French chivalry and cuisine were both highly rated in the UK but France had had a big revolution 50 years before , another in 1830 and another was fomenting and would break out in 1848 . England had the Industrial Revolution , a burgeoning Empire , marble palaces built for trade and a clear vision of the future . France and the continent had religion , political turmoil and one foot still in the Middle Ages . Or that's how it looked . In Cranford , anyway .
132797868	635556	Re : How did this beat Saving Private Ryan for the Oscar ?

163376864	635556	Re : If Great Britain had been defeated in World War 2 then what happens ?	I think it's the most interesting part of the speculation . There's no doubt that there was a lot of mindless adulation of Der Furher which would have intensified if he had been able to claim total victory in a European war ( what he actually achieved was almost close enough anyway ) . But the plotting had started well before 1938 . It seems to be accepted now that Canaris had a coup-in-waiting ready if war had started in 1938 . There were others in the wings and the German population was already sick of the sacrifices it was making for Hitler's political ambitions before the war even got going . So I don't think he and his upper echelons felt secure , even with their military victories . I think once they'd stopped fighting there would have been a lot of pressure for a return to peace and prosperity and it could easily have resulted in a reduction in State-sponsored paranoia while they built a society that was secure from both Uncle Joe and Uncle Sam . Halifax and his crew would have bought back most of Britain's Independence to allow this to come to pass as Britain's interest and Germany's didn't really overlap that much , which is why Hitler always thought he could get Britain to acquiesce . So if the Fourth Reich got itself sorted quickly and well , there simply wouldn't be a role in Europe for the USA . And , as we know , 75 % of US citizens would have been happy with that .

The British thought they should be resettled in Europe in their countries of origin . Indian Independence was an extraordinarily complex process . At no stage did Britain ' decide ' to ' create Pakistan out of India ' .

163171080	635556	Re : If Great Britain had been defeated in World War 2 then what happens ?	So after a German victory they would have still been in North Africa and helped out , without Great Britain being free then vast numbers of British troops might have defected to the Axis like the French did , the rest would be weak and have a lack of support , Not a chance . Unlike France's colonies , the major Commonwealth countries , India , Canada , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa were pretty much immune to invasion or economic damage from the Third Reich . However far it miraculously penetrated the British Isles , the Wehrmacht would be stranded in the greatest economic blockade in history , even if the US decided not to play . They had prepared for it , and well . But it would have got them in the end . Russia would have pushed the German Army back to Berlin or Hitler would have been toppled internally . In either case , the German forces occupying Britain France and the low countries would be in dire need of a deal .

156349695	635556	Re : Do Americans really not have passports ?	Because I'm not . And it isn't . Wealth in the US seems to mean something measured by quantities of wealthy individuals ( whose values are often hugely inflated by the notional value of stockholdings ) and by completely ignoring a huge underclass , the way the British ignored the same underclass in the 19C . The gap between the richest and the poorest is not much different in the US than it is in Denmark . The bottom bar in Denmark is just much higher . Making the nation wealthier overall .

This adpatation has neither . Arterton's Tess is very similar to Kinski's , a bit one dimensional . Arterton is a better choice however , a smarter actress with a much better feel for the material . But the biggest difference is in direction . Polanski's film oozes style . The BBC adaptation is pedestrian with scene after similar length scene of characters sitting down , centre stage , middle distance , talking to each other . The 2006 adaptation of Jane Eyre has the same four hour running time but did a vastly better job of setting the action in Bronte's landscape .

There's a really good RSC-derived version from the 80's with Michael Hordern as Lear and Brenda Blethyn as Cordelia but I haven't seen any of the others in the imdb list of Lears .

The point at issue is whether anyone ever did it better than JC did in Istanbul and the answer is ' No ' , though I can remember a few performances that are on a par .

127491433	635556	Re : Review of the series : Times	It's not the first time this reviewer has completely missed the point . Deborah Moggach wrote the script for 2005 Pride & Prejudice which is probably why he doesn't like her . There are many things I hated about that film but her script wasn't one of them . Unlike Andrew Davies , Moggach can produce original stuff that sounds like characters in Austen might have said it . Elizbeth's dialogue at th public ball - ' the miserable half of Derbyshire ' etc . compares well , for example , with Andrew Davies leaden attempts at irony in the Lambton episodes of P & P 1995 " I could put up with being mistress of Pemberley . . . " etc . or the hamfisted dramatic irony he inflicts on Elizabeth ' I could live my whole life in Derbyshire ' [ yuck ] . Her ability to get onto another author's wavelength is the best thing about her and she succeeds triumphantly here . I felt I was seeing and hearing the real Ann Frank about 2 minutes into the first episode and that was after my interest had been caught by how convincingly ' Dutch ' the English cast were . This was a masterpiece and for me , is the definitive version of a core text of 20C history . Ellie Kendrick is , quite simply , the best 17 year-old TV debutante I have ever seen . And the rest of the cast did her credit . Along with Felicty Jones and Ian Glen , I especially liked Kate Ashfield's understated , unheroic Miep . And this is the best TV drama since Cranford .

162455839	635556	Re : Cats and Dogs	Entirely ' mythis ' the point by failing to understand the heart of why Chandler created Marlowe in the first place . How is it elegaic , exactly ? What on earth is it elegising ? Eliot Gould's career as an actor ? There's no effort in Gould's work . He merely reprises the pseudo-professional hippy riff on medicine from his performance in MASH . I can understand why people might like this at first but for me it's as ugly , mannered and irritating as Angela Lansbury in Murder She Wrote and certainly contributes no more light to the mythos of detective fiction than you get from Jessica's feeble aura . No crime author has ever spent more time describing what he intended . To understand and represent Marlowe , subverted , upright or inverted , you have to understand the boundaries about which Chandler was so utterly specific . Altman doesn't show any sign of it and frankly , I think its beyond Gould completely . There are directors who can re-energise well-known genres or authors . Look at Granada's Sherlock Holmes , Lumet's Murder on the Orient Express or Herbert Ross's Seven Per Cent Solution , or even Clueless . You can also approach the classics sideways like Lost in Austen , Bleasdale's Canterbury Tales or Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead and end up in new or interesting places . This Altman movie doesn't do any of that . But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean , who is neither tarnished nor afraid . The detective in this kind of story must be such a man . He is the hero ; he is everything . He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man . He must be , to use a rather weathered phrase , a man of honor-by instinct , by inevitability , without thought of it , and certainly without saying it . He must be the best man in his world and a good enough man for any world . I do not care much about his private life ; he is neither a eunuch nor a satyr ; I think he might seduce a duchess and I am quite sure he would not spoil a virgin ; if he is a man of honor in one thing , he is that in all things . He is a relatively poor man , or he would not be a detective at all . He is a common man or he could not go among common people . He has a sense of character , or he would not know his job . He will take no man's money dishonestly and no man's insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge . He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him . He talks as the man of his age talks-that is , with rude wit , a lively sense of the grotesque , a disgust for sham , and a contempt for pettiness . The story is this man's adventure in search of a hidden truth , and it would be no adventure if it did not happen to a man fit for adventure . He has a range of awareness that startles you , but it belongs to him by right , because it belongs to the world he lives in . If there were enough like him , the world would be a very safe place to live in , without becoming too dull to be worth living in . The idea that Marlowe would shoot an unarmed man and then dance down the street afterwards like he just finished a shift in some EinsatzGruppe divorces the whole project from any Chandler mainstream or tributary . Much of the rest of it is no better . Like the Patricia Rozema Mansfield Park , if you changed the direct associations , the names of the characters and locations , people would have a hard time spotting anything Chandleresque at all . Look at Chinatown and LA Confidential for films descended from Chandler . This Marlowe comes from parallel universe where the crew had all smoked one too many joints .

I would never disagree with her ( on Tess , anyway , we've had a few fights about Jane Eyre ) but one of the threads you have to keep hold of in Tess is the breeding thread . Tess is a true aristocrat - a D'Urberville . Angel , the rat , is hugely turned on by this DESPITE his so-called principles . This isn't Darwinism , or at least it isn't Darwin . Darwin is not about what you inherit making you stronger otherwise blacksmiths would have the strongest sons in the world , able to lift 10 buses and throw telegraph poles to Mars . Darwin defined how nature selects the individuals in a species which are best able to survive and reproduce ensuring the survival of the species - not the individuals . All of the good and none of the bad refers to Tess's bloodline , which is at the heart of her fate - the sins of earlier generations being paid for by their descendants . If you really like exploring literary themes ( yes , I read lit at college ) , read The Eumenides by Aesychlus . You'll pick up many of the references Hardy makes to the classics and get a grasp on how the whole Fate / Revenge cycle in classic literature works . It's not too tough to read in the Penguin Classic edition and there are plenty of interesting notes .

166389866	635556	Re : What would Hamlet be like in a modern world ?	Loncraine and McKellen's Richard III is a model for updating . There are literally hundreds of enlightening connections crossing the gaps in the centuries , from Stanley withholding vital air support in the final battle ( instead of standing off with his troops and watching ) to the wonderful connection between the Rivers sub-plot and the Wallace Simpson affair . Almost every scene is full of this type of invention . And if you understand what getting a 4x4 cross-axled is all about , you'll really enjoy the way the play's most famous line is re-engineered . When it's done with thought and imagination , updating adds hugely to the experience . When it's done as a substitute for thought and imagination , as in the Kline / Pfeiffer MSND , it can be very grim indeed .

One of Apple's biggest advantages is that so many people are shrugging off its total dominance and pretending it isn't happening . It would be even more dramatic if Apple could make more of the things and telcos could sell them as they'd like . The same people are ensuring that they will have no place in the iPad market by doing the same Nelson Act .
124396139	635556	Re : Did the Canadians saved the British from losing WWI ? ? ?	I get the feeling that Australians think the Brits were out to screw them , and gave them dirty jobs that sometimes went badly , like Gallipoli , while we see it as a compliment that the Brits looked to us for the tough jobs , and we did them better than anyone else . It's true that the Canadians and Anzacs were regarded as highly effective troops ( by the British High Command AND the German High Command ) but what isn't often factored into the equation is that there were a very large number of British units in the same category which kept the number and proportion of sticky jobs relatively balanced . British casualties outnumbered Australian casualties at Gallipoli 3-1 , for example .

160359810	635556	Re : Question about Miss Harriet Smith	I think he must have resented his father to some extent otherwise even he could have made arrangements to get to his second wedding . Although a lot of children do not like to see a parent formally replaced , I think there must be some bitterness involved in failing to take that opportunity for reconciliation after the passage of so many years . However , I agree with you that pampering him has made him very aware of what he stands to lose and he has to look no further than his mother's example to discover what awaits him if he fails to toe the Enscombe line . Few of us would behave differently , I suspect , though the very significant penalty is that by carefully fitting his principles to his circumstances , Frank disqualifies himself from being suited to Emma who is hardly likely to submit to either a clandestine engagement or an approval process which she would probably fail . Once again , Sandy has preserved a nuance in her adaptation that I doubt any of the other Emma adapters even noticed .

Their opinions , once expressed , are only worth the wit used to express and defend them . I said all that about SPR quite a while ago . I have no military experience at all but have read a lot and I am particularly interested in the Battle of Normandy as I own a house there . Historians like Anthony Beevor , who have written extensively on The Battle of Normandy , think SPR is worthless as military history for very good reasons , lots of which are obvious when you think about them for more than 5 seconds . The whole premise of the film , that the only way to find an American soldier 3 days after D-Day was to send a platoon off all over a battlefield to look for him , is ridiculous . A real soldier , who lost three real brothers , discovered what happened to the two D-Day victims in less than 2 hours , one day after the invasion with a radio and a field telephone . I'm pleased you enjoyed SPR . I didn't . I don't complain about it on the SPR board . But I'm happy to deal with any SPR fans who come over here to air their grievances . Though I don't see why I should explain things twice . Clear enough the first time round .

165087497	635556	Re : did queen elizabeth really go to the theater	Oooooh . Fight . Patronage was how art got done before the Elizabethan Age but late Elizabethan Theatre was the watershed between patronage and earning a living - the age of the independent , stony-broke producer , Henslowe style , with a theatre to fill and only entrance money to pay for it . It was when copy rights were first asserted and gave birth to the idea that an artist might own his creations and the rights to earn money from them . This was even tested in the courts in 1599 by Will himself when four of his sonnets were reproduced without permission . All very rough and ready and very early stage , but once dedicated theatres were built and professional actors enjoyed competition and could charge for their services , theatre moved from the faddish patronage of the rich into a new commercial world of showbiz . Once Shakespeare died it went into the toilet , pulled in its horns again , and of course , patronage continued elsewhere and continued in England . But the lid came off Pandora's box in the 1590's . And never quite got properly shut again .
159132354	635556	Re : Jane Eyre was supposed to be ugly . . .	These two fancy each other from the off in the way that men and women have always fancied each other . Their affair is not a gradual learning to appreciate each other's virtues as a long term companion . Whatever you think you have learned about their relative appearance from Jane's own description of it , you have to take it for granted that they were very strongly attracted to each other from the outset . This series is unique in concentrating and focussing on that aspect when the two meet in Hay Lane . Just as in the book , you can foresee the path that each wants to take as they take leave , whether they will be able to or not . Stephens puts more into the words ' Miss Jane Eyre ' than some Rochester's managed in their whole performance . Only the Ganisbourg / Hurt version comes anywhere near , in fact it's the only other version where Rochester actually looks as if he's fallen off a horse rather than dropped a shilling in the mud .

I don't relish it , nor do I want to upset the polite and reasonable posters with which this board is currently blessed . But I'm not above a bit of knockabout , gloves-off Internet debate when I'm being patronised . You keep harping on about Western definitions of adultery as if there are 100's of different meanings in different cultures . There aren't . The veto on Adultery is one of the 10 Commandments . Fornication does not feature and hardly anybody is confused , with the exception of yourself , as to which is which . Go and look it up at source and leave the Ladybird Book of Psychology on the shelf . It's not even slightly relevant to Tess's situation ( until she takes Alec's shilling ) as Angel himself points out , somewhat poignantly . Your definitions are off and your history of Victorian thought must be another Ladybird book from the 50's . But neither are as wildly inaccurate as your history of critical thought . A construct of the late 60's ? ? ? ? I studied the book in the mid-sixties with a genius of an English teacher in Liverpool , who studied it in the 30's with F R Leavis at Cambridge . The idea that the rape interpretation is a construct of the late 60's is the daftest you've so far submitted .

152967805	635556	Re : Thoughts on the first part	Rather disappointed . Despite a fractured timeline either side of WW2 and it's tone and pace are rather monotonous and it's too predictable . And much as I love her , it's clear that what's concealed by Ruth Wilson's accent is an even posher Surrey accent , definitely not a Yorkshire pig farmer . She looked and dressed like Eva Longoria in the scenes on the farm . Charlotte Riley was the right choice . Ruth is still lovely to watch but she doesn't quite fit the bill . Still , Episode 2 could pull it all back .
152446814	635556	Re : Answering Objections to the Bedroom Scene	Exactly . Although I think the word ' moral ' causes a lot of unnecessary trouble . Victorian morality at the time would have been more outraged by a master marrying a governess than by a married man taking a servant as his live-in mistress . She realises that Rochester and she are soulmates but that living with him is an absolute wrong , not merely wrong in the eyes of society . This series draws the distinction more carefully than any other by clearly depicting what Jane is giving up by the decision to leave and contrasting it to what she is prepared to do to palliate a disapproving society by including the month of abstinence and formal courtship .
146619069	635556	Re : Catherine Riley	On the whole I can understand why other versions drop a lot of the last third though , they're both so full of s|hite you need water wings . Whilst I perhaps won't go all the way with you on this , I will say that the Brontes benefit more than some other authors , Austen for example , from imaginative adaptation . The important thing is to produce an accurate incarnation of the main characters and get some life into their relationships with each other and the rest of the cast . Without referencing any previous performances , Riley and Hardy carried this off rather well .
163379073	635556	Re : If Great Britain had been defeated in World War 2 then what happens ?

Suppose Britain is conquered and Heydrich gets himself bumped off , bumping off Hitler and Goebbels . Ambassador Alfa , new Reichsfuhrer Squeeth and possibly Admiral Comabtareview and Feld Marshal Hotrodder spot an opportunity and through some fast footwork , create the New Nazi Kommisariat around them . After throwing Himmler in jail on corruption charges - or better yet , murder charges - what's our first move ?

96751767	635556	Re : Tiny little things	You're right . There's a lot more going on with Blanche in this version than in others . Sandy and Susan worked hard on Blanche and Christina Cole turned in a great performance , from the moment Jane gets her first glimpse , expecting Edward to come riding across the hill and sees Blanche instead . The much maligned ouija board scene is the where it starts , where the rivals for Edward are set up . Blanche becomes aware , after the ' heart-less ' incident that Edward has something on his mind and becomes alert to the possibility of a rival . When she next sees Jane , in her nighty , she thinks she knows who her rival is ( and Jane moves a step forward with Edward too ) . I like to think that Blanche discusses the rivalry with her mother , prompting the acerbity about governesses . So by the conversation in the hall , Blanche knows that Jane has turned Edward's head , just not how far . And when she says " Please , Miss Eyre , continue . . " she's polite because confidently expecting Jane to flounder and appear in an unfavourable light next to her . Eshton spots the game at this point too . He might even be teasing the Ingrams with all his swallow talk , knowing why Rochester has dropped out of group exercise on the terrace . I'm sure Eshton knows what's going on when Jane and Edward say goodbye . So by the time we get to " Does Miss Eyre need to speak to you ? " Blanche is fully alert and unwilling to allow Jane any one-to-one time with E .

144638596	635556	Re : Just Watched ' The Third Man ' for the first time	I really wish people would stop all this genre nonsense . It's as if the categories critics use to avoid the need for original thought when reviewing have actually become more important than the films they go to see . Whether TTM is good or poor as a ' noir ' doesn't affect its status as a masterpiece by the merest smidgin . Film categories are just critical shorthand , useful for one person to describe a film to someone who hasn't seen it , like saying a wine is ' buttery ' . Saying that The Maltese Falcon is a better noir than TTM is like saying that teal is a better colour for dining rooms than taupe . Teal and taupe have no objective meaning , especially outside the US and you can't attribute qualitative properties to anything that is essentially just an expression of degree . This film has been singled out and supported as special for a variety of very good reasons . You don't like it , that's fine . There are lots of masterpieces I don't like . But don't bother with a list of its failings to fit into some genre or other . There isn't any genre it fits into , as far as I can see , anyway .

I suppose you can make a case for saying that Lime shouldn't have been on the scene of his own faked death but really , it has to be Lime . I think Greene was intentionally echoing Hammet's ' The Thin Man ' with his title ( and there are other similarities ) . The title of both movies refers to the missing presence .
21030588	635556	Re : Does Henry really love Fanny	No . Henry does not love Fanny . Many people believe that Fanny could have changed Henry and created a successful marriage , but this is wrong . Henry and Mary are modern , amoral , inward looking , selfish , only intersted in money , pleasure and themselves . They see the world as a playground in which they are lawful predators on the rich and foolish . Fanny , Sir Thomas , Edmund are conservative , caring , traditional , outward looking , moral and principled ( though Edmund wavers , especially during the play ) . Uniquely , Mansfield Park also shows us the world outside , in detail when Fanny goes to Portsmouth , and implicitly through Sir Thomas ' business in Antigua . The novel brings into conflict the worlds of principle and lack of principle , which is what makes it a great novel . The film ignores every important theme to create , instead , a silly sex comedy , which is what makes it trivial . Henry could never have married Fanny . It would have been six months before he was off after Maria , Julia or any one of a thousand others . Since Fanny realised this , there was never the smallest chance of her accepting him , even if she didn't love Edmund .
164378757	635556	Re : Flotilla passengers : Go back to Auschwitz	Whilst I wouldn't disagree entirely , some other things are pretty obvious too and many of them are what the sensible elements of the Israeli press have picked up on . Entebbe was 30 years ago . Thet days when you could earn international kudos with elite military operations with just a few civilian casualties in acceptably low numbers are over . Another misfiring stunt like this and that won't be all that's over . Israel is haemorrhaging friends and supporters . The blockade is not sustainable . Why Israeli supporters outside Israel can't even discuss issues that are rising to the top of the agenda inside Israel itself is a part of the problem that needs to be urgently addressed . They are the strongest source of nourishment for the ' seven idiots ' in charge who are ' more dangerous to the future of Israel than Hamas ' . ( quotes from haaretz ) .
158331474	635556	Re : a bit confused about one thing	On ' Vices ' . She uses the word ' pun ' in the singular . This debate has been going on for years and years and it's one of the flimsiest and daftest in the whole world of Austen . In the 19C Royal Navy , sodomy carried the most extravagantly horrific and unusual punishment , flogging round the fleet . It was rare and unforgettable and the idea that ' rear ' was a euphemistic , Kenneth Williams-style reference to it normal polite conversation is unsupportable . Especially in a writer who felt the way Jane Austen did about the Navy . The litmus test is Fielding . If Fielding didn't use it and mean it as a pun , then Austen didn't either . And he didn't . The Navy's ' reputation ' partly comes from Churchill who said to someone he was trying hard to annoy , ' Don't talk to me about naval tradition , rum , sodomy and the lash is all the naval tradition I know ' , partly from camp music hall use of the phrase ' Hello sailor ' but there is little connection between the service and homosexuality before WW2 . If it was a deliberate pun by Mary Crawford , no one at the time would have understood her . Does it , therefore , seem likely that it was Austen's intention ?

120743802	635556	Re : DVD available for pre-order	Having watched it , I'm left feeling deprived not having seen it in the theatre . The performances are mostly fantastic , especially McKellen and Romola Garai but there's a diminishing effect transferring to DVD this way which I got unreasonably irritated by . Stage effects on the heath are particularly ill-served , when you are meant to be overwhelmed by cosmic forces and the characters are confined on a small carpet of unruly astroturf . Lear is best live in the theatre . In the round if possible . My # 1 Lear remains the Liverpool Everyman production of 1972 , with the thrust stage and whole of the interior space painted white . Bernard Hill , Pete Postlethwaite , Anthony Sher as an utterly stunning Fool , Jonathan Pryce as Edgar , Trevor Eve , Bill Nighy and Julie Walters . How's that for a cast in rep ? Postlethwaite is back in Lear at The Everyman next month . It's already a sell-out , sadly . Maybe it'll transfer . What they should do is use this cast in next year's big budget adaptation . I can't see the cast they have chosen measuring up to this crew . I think Hopkins , Knightley and Paltrow are all badly miscast .

159132807	635556	Re : Tiny little things	There was once a list of things that made this version stand out from the rest . Symbolism was near the top . You're absolutely right . It's everywhere , from the pictures on the wall to the exotic beetles in the study , from red scarves to red carriage wheels . In Episode 1 , in a fabulously lit , Gothic 4 second shot , deliberately framed to look like a portrait by Lord Leighton , Jane walks across the dark hall at Thornfield late at night , displaying , instead of timidity , the calm controlling confidence that Rochester will need in a number of nighttime incidents in the near future . No dialogue necessary . A few pictures worth a few thousand words .

Leight Brackett and Robert Altman produced an incarnation doing things that are off the scale of what is recognisably Marlowe , compounding the fractured picture by casting a sparsely talented actor incapable of stepping outside his own limited schtick . Recognising this , I think Altman is actually taking the piss , casting Gould as himself in Nashville . Nothing looks either connected or right . That isn't adapting . That's failing to get on the wavelength .
83484446	635556	Re : Which is BEST version ?	> > But , BASED ON ACTUAL REVIEWS WRITTEN BY 2006 FANS , it is entirely accurate to say that the reasons 2006's fans like 2006 center on the romantic or sexual attraction they feel to the actor Toby Stephens , rather than any appreciation of the story itself , or even the character of Jane Eyre . Perfectly addressed . I had hoped that even if silly females who were into Toby and not the story or Jane's character would at least contemplate reading the book that something might be gained out of the 2006 fiasco . Open your eyes . Patronising 06 fans is not much of a recommendation for another version . The 06 board is one of the best , if not THE best , on imdb . 06 is the winner . This is because it tackles fidelity to the original in the way all TV drama should tackle it . By getting the actors so familiar with the chraracters that they deliver an accurate portrayal even when they have their back to the screen and no dialogue . There is a triumphant example of this immediately before the proposal scene when the two leads create more emotional tension and drama than there is in the whole of the 83 version . Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson had the book in their pockets throughout the shoot . She is Jane and is the only Jane . The rest , especially , Zela and Joan Fontaine are pale imitations . Ask yourself " Is Joan Fontaine a credible 19C governess ? " . Sorcha admits she was all at sea and hates her performance in the 73 version . Gainsbourg is the most limited . I have never understood way people watch adaptations awarding ticks for versimilitude , missing everything on offer in reinterpretation . JE 2006 is a groundbreaking adaptation , head and shoulders above all its rivals . Charlotts Bronte would certainly have it at the head of her list .
157939578	635556	Re : Marni Nixon sang in movie , not Hepburn	Common knowledge . Though Cukor bitterly regrets deciding to dub ' Wouldn't it be lovely ' . Hepburn's own vocals retain the comedy and yearning of the original and match the performance brilliantly . The Warner Bros DVD includes the scene with Hepburn singing and it's a huge improvement . Nixon couldn't do comedy . The decisions to dub this and ' Show me ' were taken late on and dropped because they both contain notes that were just outside Hepburn's range .

You have to remember that it would have taken a long time for Holly to get it , accept and travel to Vienna back then , what with all the permits and specialist travel arrangements . Railways were still not operating properly and commercial air services were in a bit of a mess too . Harry invited him before he was in any trouble , so my theory is that he did it to reconnect with an old friend whose morals weren't too scrupulous and use his name and talents to maybe try and put a legitimate front on his shady operations .

162569045	635556	Re : Chorus . Yeah .	A chorus whose ironic intent lies in it not being a chorus . This is how this film works . Irony that isn't irony . Deconstruction that doesn't understand what it's deconstructing . Demytholgising a myth that the original had already neatly demythologised . The skill of the original author so greatly exceeds the skill of his updaters and improvisers that they chip away the essentials along with the surface and you just end up with new mist , new shadows . The film it most resembles is Patricia Rozema's Mansfield Park . Academics have written PhD's on why the original text should not be ' privileged ' in modern adaptation and based them on that film . There is a strong and active coterie of intelligent critics who think it leads the way to a new and exciting approach to the understanding of core texts . But they're all wrong . Barking mad in fact .

166642849	635556	Re : I watched the Redux before the Original ?	Like many of the other additions , the French scenes were added back to Redux to make the film's pivotal point , excised from the ' 79 cut as the war was still too close for FFC ( or anyone ) to accurately spell things out . The French have been there for generations , it is their home and that is why they fight and why they stay . The Americans are there because they are foolishly paranoid about Communist intentions and are fighting for ' the biggest nothing in history ' . The ' 79 film is a surreal condemnation of war and colonialism . Redux is a withering polemic on US foreign interventionism . However you compare the two , you have to remember that it is the latter that really represents what FFC wanted to say . He didn't shoot anything new , after all .

I like Hardy as Sykes . But is he as good as Oliver Reed ? I like Sophie as Nancy but will she surpass Kay Walsh , or even Emily Woof ? Folk memory even contains a musical soundtrack with hideously persistent tunes and lyrics . If you can't have novelty , you have to rely on skill and craftsmanship and there simply isn't enough go round in this .

124797219	635556	Re : Toby Esterhase Pre-Circus	I think your last idea is closest .

Good education in Hungary before the war , a year in England at Oxford or Cambridge perhaps , drafted into the army , everything goes wrong during the war , then he fights his way into the service .
120091490	635556	Re : uni	Two young , attractive people , impulsive and instinctive by nature , trying to keep warm in the woods at night ? A pagan sacred place ( the " oldest wood in England " with it " Druidical mistletoe " ) , where all the birds and animals seem in harmony ? In self-abandonment , they become part of that timeless , bigger landscape . A charming picture . Midsummer Night's Dream , perhaps ? If you look hard at that you'll see that even Hermia was very worried about what might happen if Lysander didn't ' lie farther off ' . It's certainly not what Hardy wrote . Whilst he didn't want to put Alec in the gutter , with the violent animals who commit the crime with threatened or actual violence in grimy back streets , he states explicitly that Tess's God , her guardian angel and Tishbite ( who revenges upon those who have done evil in the eyes of the Lord ) have momentarily abandoned her and Alec is serving her as her ancestors served others . Alec commits a crime . The crime is called rape - a true catastrophe . A catastrophe . Not a word Hardy uses often . It is described here and , though there are explicit references to the crime of rape having occurred at The Chase later in the book , you still don't need any more evidence than Hardy gives you here that he has no such woodland harmony with nature in mind . " Tess ! " said d'Urberville . There was no answer . The obscurity was now so great that he could see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet , which represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves . Everything else was blackness alike . D'Urberville stooped ; and heard a gentle regular breathing . He knelt and bent lower , till her breath warmed his face , and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers . She was sleeping soundly , and upon her eyelashes there lingered tears . Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around . Above them rose the primeval yews and oaks of The Chase , in which there poised gentle roosting birds in their last nap ; and about them stole the hopping rabbits and hares . But , might some say , where was Tess's guardian angel ? where was the providence of her simple faith ? Perhaps , like that other god of whom the ironical Tishbite spoke , he was talking , or he was pursuing , or he was in a journey , or he was sleeping and not to be awaked . Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue , sensitive as gossamer , and practically blank as snow as yet , there should have been traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive ; why so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus , the wrong man the woman , the wrong woman the man , many thousand years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order . One may , indeed , admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present catastrophe . Doubtless some of Tess d'Urberville's mailed ancestors rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time . But though to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for divinities , it is scorned by average human nature ; and it therefore does not mend the matter . As Tess's own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic way : " It was to be . " There lay the pity of it . An immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroine's personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother's door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm .
164265496	635556	Re : I'll give you five reasons ( there are , of course , more )	International law , first of all isn't really law , its guide lines nations agree to abide by , with no real legal status what so ever . You couldn't be more wrong if you tried all day . International law is as binding as any other form of law , it's just that there isn't an International Government or Judiciary to investigate and try infractions . That's the bit nations have to agreed abide by . As far as maritime law goes , if you want insurance on your iPads while they're at sea , you'd better be using suppliers who conform to international law . Israel's military has the right to do whatever they want if they feel their national security is at risk , Again , absolutely 100 % wrong . This is the 21st Century and we are not governed by the laws of the jungle any more . War crimes are very difficult to prosecute , but it happens . They can stop and board and search any ship they have reason to believe may be carrying weapons to a terrorist organization , in international waters or not . Its called the Proliferation Security Initiative and both Israel and Turkey signed a few years ago . Wrong again . The Proliferation Security Agreement , signed between the two countries , gives Israelis the right to stop and search if there is probable cause but does not otherwise waive the rights of crew , passengers or vessel owners . The commandos comprehensively exceeded the terms of all laws and agreements and unlawfully killed nine people . Anyway , since Turkey had given a collateral warranty that there were no weapons on board , there was no probable cause . The only weapons on board , apart from those belonging to the commandos , were improvised at short notice . Even if you allow all of that to pass , disallowing three people they had injured any medical treatment , allowing them to exsanguinate under guard is illegal killing whatever else was going on .

Chandler is the American Jane Austen and this adaptation is like one of those terrible Austen adaptations where the filmmakers haven't understood thing one . I love Altman most of the time but his career includes misses along with the hits . This was not just a box office flop ( they couldn't get anyone into the cinema to watch it until they started using Mad Magazine posters ) but a miss and a big ' un , full of nasty smells , not the worst of which is the cock-eyed hommage to The Third Man at the end which starts with a cheesy cackle and ends in a rambunctious sneer .

And as you point out , what was left in the investigation plotline was rather mundane . I choked a bit on the phone , but if he hadn't had it on him , the suicide story wouldn't stick . Would have been nice to see a few of the villains , especially the official lipreader , get theirs but effective nontheless and it's not always a bad thing to leave the audience wanting more .

163374073	635556	Re : If Great Britain had been defeated in World War 2 then what happens ?	The B-36Would make no impact whatsoever on a German dominated Europe in the late 40's or any other time , just as its replacement , the B52 contributed very little to the USA's efforts in Viet-Nam . a couple of hundred fission devices , which they could have built by 1947 , would utterly destroy Germany . No guarantee that the US gets the bomb first . Very unlikely in fact as nearly half the Manhattan team ( including all the personnel who solved the detonation problem ) are now on the wrong side of the Atlantic . Evacuation only gets out personnel thought to be key when it was planned in 1938 . No Werner von Braun und Kinder means the Germans get ICBMs before the US gets to stage one with them . The same is likely to be true of jet engines , programmable computers and a whole host of other developments which Germany and its Allies are geared up to take advantage of when the US is not . The US can only play detente with Europe . And with the poorer hand . The Wehrmacht didn't depose him after he failed to take Britain but they would if he succeed ? Whyever would they do that ? ? They tried to get rid of him on 38 different occasions by some counts . There was , as there always was , a majority of Germans who wanted something different . With Europe ostensibly at peace and Hitler's War over , faced with starting another one against Russia , I think they may have got their wish . Maybe someone even more ambitious and resentful of Hitler's interference , Himmler's nonsense and Joey the Krip's antics , like Heydrich , backed by most of the High Command , might have staged another Night of the Long Knives . Conquering Britain in 1940 would leave the Nazis just one big PR effort short of total security - always supposing they didn't break Monty's First Law of Warfare and cross the Niemen . I'd be very confident , if I'd just bumped Hitler and Himmler off and was going into negotiations with FDR and Churchill , Leopold , Wilhelmina and Petain . Just think about how much I could give away whilst keeping everything I wanted . There is no likelihood that this could ever have taken place and even if the Germans did get across and consolidated , British determination and ingenuity allied to American help and money would probably have turned them out but failing all that , you would have a smarter , richer and more highly militarised Europe trailing the US in its wake not keeping its fingers crossed that the US would sort things out to the pre-1939 state of affairs . It just wouldn't happen . We'd have to wait for Lennon and McCartney .

Sure there aren't enough Hollywood movies about the Soviet ( or British , for that matter ) contributions to the war . This is because Hollywood films are made for an American audience . It's fine to complain but you have to remember the context and hyperbolically claiming all the credit for the Allied victory for The Soviet Union ( non-aggression pact ring any bells ) doesn't help anyone's case . And whether the Germans had won or not , we'd still all be speaking English or Spanish as these are the two languages that are easiest to learn in which you can get by with the smallest possible amount of grammatical knowledge and the tiniest of vocabularies .

152876899	635556	Re : Fennyman : Delivery of His Lines	In his opening scene , Fennyman is torturing the producer . In this , his last scene , he is overcome with emotion at the quality of the finished article and inspired to create a convincingly whole character for the Apothecary out of just the three lines . An indication of how far he has come and a more subtle indication of how much trouble Shakespeare takes with his minor characters and how much you can get out of them if you try .

124130850	635556	Re : Disappointing	Having a degree in film doesn't mean that my opinion is any more valid than other people's when it comes down to whether you enjoy the film or not , and I don't say it to be " look how smart i am " That is exactly why you are saying it . Otherwise , why bother ? There are views expressed here with which there is no need to exhibit patience . People posting them can safely be ignored . Postings which say ' this movie sucks because it has no car chases ' ( not quite true ) or ' very boring ' come from people whose minds cannot be changed by internet debate . There have , however , been dozens of postings on the board from people who have re-evaluated their opinion after looking at the film again . More than you may see on other classic boards , possibly because it is a serious , well-made film which deals with a timeless , generic subject . I also think ( though I'm not accusing you specifically ) that people coming to it expecting an Orson Welles star vehicle are doomed to disappointment . His part is small and it's not his film , despite the fact that two of his scenes are amongst the most famous in cinema history . They're not the best scenes in the movie and Welles ' is not the best performance .
127230065	635556	Steeling ourselves for the last episode ? ? ?	This has been a great start to 2009 drama after a so-so 2008 .

119611266	635556	Re : Final episode thoughts	I couldn't agree more . I think Hardy adaptations like Bronte and Dickens adaptations , first and foremost have to be planted firmly in an authentic landscape . Austen can slide a decade or two . The drawing rooms are more important than the countryside . But Hardy demands a close relationship with his environment . This is not an easy thing to do . It's about editing as much as scriptwriting . When Ecclestone first goes to Christminster in Jude , when Ruth Wilson walks around Thornfield on her first morning or when HBC gets the Tube in the opening shots of Wings of the Dove you can see the quality of effort made to set the correct backdrop to the action . In the episode The Mughal Room of Jewel in the Crown , seven minutes go by entirely without dialogue as two characters explore the empty governor's palace in a cobwebbed elegy for The Raj . Very little of that went on here . Nor did they catch more than a whiff of the Laurentian throbbing that the novel is laced with and they can thank Gemma for what little there was . I think she had a better idea of who Tess is than the director . So . For me , an enjoyable effort . On a par with the 98 production with more of the novel , a stronger but less vivacious Tess , a better Alec and a significantly weaker Angel . Decent playing from the minor characters , especially Rebekah Staton . I won't be rushing out for the DVD but I will be rousing myself to see Gemma in the new Bond at the cinema .
153494612	635556	Re : Thoughts on the first part	Tricky discussion . The vocabulary seems to have become almost the most important part , these days . The woman in the cinema queue was pretty representative and the argument resembles one from 1944 my father described to me years ago . Two white American officers tried to hustle two African American soldiers out of a taxi in Lime Street . The officers got the same speech about ' this is England and we don't do that here . ' and had to find another . West Indian , Asian and African American soldiers were fighting volunteers from abroad and treated with respect and whilst the British allowed the white American officer class to enforce distinctions they rarely bothered themselves when no one was looking . No one wanted any trouble over race and nationality during the war . Everyone did have their fingers firmly crossed that all the strangers would go home at the end of the war . Integrating them permanently into British peacetime society was a different kettle of fish . Small Island did a pretty reasonable job of pointing out the difference , I thought .

The only really effective French armoured division in 1940 was the 15th , commanded by General Juin . Easily the best French General of the war , though Leclerc ran him close as a leader and tactician .

What do you think he was ' trying ' at Trantridge ? To make her an offer of marriage ? In referring to what occurred at Trantridge I am intending to compare it to Alec's lack of sincere feeling which is evident later in the book . You agree that he was a seducer . You must therefore agree that he never had any ' honourable intentions ' towards Tess . You surely cannot think that his actions were those of a genuine lover . Do you think that " for three mortal months you have trifled with my feelings , eluded me and snubbed me ' is a fair summary of what is going on between Alec and Tess ?

152903019	635556	Re : Disappointing	Well a lot of lesser known Hitchcocks are lesser known for a reason and if you're really saying that you think it doesn't belong in the top 250 , what you're really saying is that you don't rate it at all . For me , there are only two Hitchcocks in the same class as TTM , Psycho and The 39 Steps . Whatever its place in the imdb top 250 , there is a widespread consensus that TTM is in the very top flight of British films . I think , at this distance from when it was made , whilst many acknowledge the quality of the unforgettable performances and the dialogue ( you can't surely deny it contains , if not the best , then probably the most famous ad lib , first appearance and last scene in movie history ) , it gets far less credit than it deserves for the most accurately imagined and delivered picture of life in conquered Germany and Austria after the war . Many would go much further in praising it ( and Catch 22 ) as some of the best analysis of how much damage the quick buck and the dirty dollar can do . Or how mankind passed into an amoral state , unable to cope with the carnage . I understand why people are disappointed because it turns out not to be what they have imagined , but given the above , I don't see any way at all that someone could contend that it is overrated 59 places behind the sentimentally overwrought Shawshank Redemption or 50 behind the ass-achingly boring LOTR .
119143305	635556	Re : It was rape not seduction .	But Hardy is talking about knights and peasant girls here , NOT Tess and Alec ! He uses this as a contrast too what is happening between them , to show that it is NOT forced or ruthless . The irony is extensively layered . Tess's ancestors are knights so she is both a true peer of the realm and a true peasant girl . Alec has made a false claim to knighthood - a peasant masquerading as a peer . Adultery would be a pale shadow for Hardy to be invoking ( adultery , by the way , involves one of the partners being married - so we can drop that altogether ) . Hardy is clearly referring to the knights of old taking peasant women by force , not wooing them into extra marital relations . Tess , he suggests , is suffering retribution for old crimes . The nature of the old crime is as clear as a church in daylight . What happens afterwards at Trantridge is neither here nor there as far as the crime goes . It's clear there was a relationship and Tess may have tried to taste a life which she thought was the only one open to her . There may well have been more sex . But Hardy says Tess is a ' Pure Woman , Faithfully Represented ' . He absolutely does not mean ' a mostly pure woman with a few vague , insignificant misdemeanors on her sheet ' . Tess is wronged - taken advantage of . The novel published in its entirety is something of a second draft . The first 1891 serialised version , which shirleyhelstone clearly has , is even more explicit . Hardy made extensive notes about a rape case in 1881 in which a woman has been plied with doctored alcohol and was then taken without her consent . Hardy knew the law to a tee . In the serialised version , Alec administers a draft to Tess from " a druggist's bottle " that he " held . . . to her mouth unawares " . This is not legitimate seduction technique , is it ? He removed the references to the drugging from the first collected editon and all subsequent editions have omitted it . He left the other instances of violent penetration - Prince's death , Alec's murder , the thorn which pricks Tess's chin etc . and he tellingly left the tittle-tattle in Marlott in C13 ( which supports the BBC's sound effects ) - " A little more than persuading had to do wi ' the coming o't , I reckon . There were they that heard a sobbing one night last year in The Chase ; and it mid ha ' gone hard wi ' a certain party if folks had come along . " " Well , a little more , or a little less , ' twas a thousand pities that it should have happened to she , of all others . But ' tis always the comeliest ! The plain ones be as safe as churches - - hey , Jenny ? " Why he removed the more damning references is an interesting question but what he left behind should leave no room for doubt . The incline was the same down which d'Urberville had driven her so wildly on that day in June . Tess went up the remainder of its length without stopping , and on reaching the edge of the escarpment gazed over the familiar green world beyond , now half-veiled in mist . It was always beautiful from here ; it was terribly beautiful to Tess to-day , for since her eyes last fell upon it she had learnt that the serpent hisses where the sweet birds sing , and her views of life had been totally changed for her by the lesson . The serpent hisses where the sweet birds sing . Paradise Lost but not , this time , through temptation .

117881011	635556	Re : The ' Independent ' review	Personally I take Koestler's view of the surrounding tranquility , that when people are being submitted to the worst that others can do to them , in the form of torture and humiliation , there is always the sense that life is going on normally - that just a few feet away birds are singing and other people are going about their daily business . The whole scene has a feeling of classical antiquity surrounding it ( as do later scenes especially her arrest at Stonehenge on the ancient altar of sacrifice , not to mention the direct reference to Aesychlus in te conclusion ) and whilst Tess does not immediately get herself clear of danger , I do not think it is her fault that it may have occurred to her that staying and marrying Alec might have been everyone's favourite solution . Remember also that Alec is a serial offender . Tess is not his first victim .

132085644	635556	Re : How did this beat Saving Private Ryan for the Oscar ?	1 . Earn this . What exactly is Ryan supposed to earn ? The sacrifice of Millar's platoon ? Why ? Why should Ryan have to earn anything ? If he'd said ' go and beat the living beep out of whoever sent us here ' that would have made a sort of sense . Did Miller say " earn this " to the parents of the French kid ? Did he say to the villagers in the pub in England " Hey , you limey hayseeds have to earn the sacrifice of my men in Italy " ? Did he write home to New England saying " all you teachers back there have to earn the sacrifice I've made by coming over here while you all sit at home " ? Of course not . It would be ridiculous to think any soldier would indulge in such sentimental accountancy . It's nonsense , of course , in the first place , that a platoon would be wandering round a battlefield like this . With a radio and a map he could have found Private Ryan on the first afternoon without leaving his seat ( exactly what the real soldier tasked with finding the real Private Ryan did ) . 2 . Releasing Steamboat Willy behind German lines ? Grow up . He'd have been on their trail with three mates and some decent hardware 10 minutes after reaching the trees . They'd all have been dead inside an hour if they'd let him go . 3 . If you want life and death without the Hollywood schmaltz , try Band of Brothers . The problem is that real heroics and real heros just aren't exciting enough for Spielberg . Apart from the landing , nothing in SPR is real . Paltrow & Fiennes laughing & talking his literature before their love scene doesn't deserve to have the movie banned surely ? That was one of the most cringe scenes I've EVER witnessed ! This is a very clever interchange with extracts from the play moving from the mouths of Romeo to Juliet . It's lovely to hear the beautiful language properly understood to the point where it can be reinvented and given new life by top actors in a new and relevant context .

Page 2 has more , page 3 the same . And almost every week someone starts a new one or bumps an old one to the top . This is an immensely popular film , hugely honoured and decorated by the industry , audience organisations and critics . It has a script written by one of the best playwrights alive , a beautifully paced comic heartbeat , a magnificent cast and was directed by one of the best directors working today . You won't find anything , anywhere , that has funnier or more intelligent things to say about the invention of show business than SiL . And yet there is an unceasing procession of infantile , brainless , humourless halfwits , upset that their might be people in the world who have a higher opinion of SiL than their favourite Steven Spielberg film ( which is , to the Battle of Normandy , what Le Rouge et Le Noir was to the invention of nail manufacturing ) and they are encouraged by the PC police as everyone should be ' entitled to an opinion ' . 7 Oscars , 43 Awards , 61 nominations entitle the people around here who do want to discuss the film without getting dragged into fruitless comparisons to be a little rough with people who come in just to slate it without offering anything in the way of an argument . Happy to discuss anything about the film you might or might not like but SiL Fans WIth Attitude has been up and running for some time now and will continue until its work is done ( though I agree with you , it should watch its vocab ) .

124129691	635556	Re : Did the Canadians saved the British from losing WWI ? ? ?	There's a very good and touching video about the significance about Canada's contribution to World War One and whether Britain's dominion countries such as Canada , Australia and New Zealand boast too much about their contributions to the war effort and eventual victory for the Allies . Part of the English technique in holding the Empire together was to allow this to happen , encourage it even . In fact , if there were no feats of arms to praise , the English would get up interest in a sport and allow themselves to get walloped at it . So much so that these days and Englishman hardly dares call himself ' English ' out of respect to the Scottish , Welsh and Irish peoples which England added to ' Great Britain ' largely to stop the French and Spanish trying to bribe them to invade England . The whole modern notion of Englishness is a negative concept , like drawing the holes between objects instead of the objects themselves . There is no strong historical English stereotype , ( apart from Hollywood butlers and upper class twits ) , unlike Scots , Irish , Welsh , boof-headed Aussies and the like . The English have always been keen to sink into the background and sublimate their national character inside whatever nation they are trying to get along with . Everything goes mostly OK as long as people did exactly what the English told them to do . " Well played chaps , now let's just get on with business , shall we ? " It was a good technique for the times and for a long time suited a country with a tiny standing army and a massive merchant marine . The Dutch did much the same thing , also very successfully .

I think it had Jonathan Pryce , Anthony Sher , Bernard Hill , Trevor Eve , Bill Nighy and Julie Walters in it . Wonder how much it would cost to put that lot together today ? Anyway , given his memory and his dislike of paper , I don't think there can be too many suspects when it comes to knowing the details of his pre-broadcast thought processes .

161683532	635556	Re : Does anyone own a full 240 min DVD of Tess 2008 ?	I've looked at the episodes recorded on my Sky + box . They run for 57 minutes , shorn of previews and credits . The title ' Tess ' , before which there is no dialogue , appears just under 2 minutes in and the opening credits finish 3 . 5 minutes in , by which time scenes are underway . This would suggest that by cropping all the type overlays , you should end up with 4x53 and a bit minutes , which is very close to the 212 minute running time of the Region 2 BBC disk . 264 minutes is 28 minutes past the longest possible version you could make from what was broadcast in the UK so I reckon that's a mistake and you'll be getting the same 212 minutes disk set we have here and that what is missing is just the stuff under the opening and closing credits . The running time of any ripped version will be affected by the frame rate and other settings in the software used to rip it . I would certainly buy any boxed set that offered scenes I haven't seen yet .

Listen to yourself .
164260854	635556	Re : ' Peace Activists ' were on a suicide run	They were aid workers . Actually , they weren't . Most of ones defending the boat were part of the crew . They had a responsibility to defend their passengers who were clearly being attacked from the sea and from the air , by illegals in international waters . All eye witness accounts seem to agree that this is what they did . It is both offensive , ridiculous and an affront to international law to portray the perpetrators of an illegal commando-style attack as victims .
166856186	635556	Re : So , I've finally seen the whole series	I agree . It's all still on my Sky + box and I've probably watched it more times than any other Austen adaptation . Very few actresses can play a character significantly younger than themselves but that girl sitting , fidgeting through the Weston's marriage ceremony is clearly a callow teenager and years younger than the woman who makes it up with Knightly with the new baby in the hall not many minutes of screen-time later . Garai delivers a solid progression from start to finish . It is impossible to imagine the Emma of even the first half of Episode 4 shouting and stamping her heels in the shrubbery like the Emma of Episode 2 . We see each of the curtains drawn back for Emma , just as we do in the novel and she visibly grows up after each incident . The row with Knightley , the row with Elton , the heartbreak for Harriet , the expansion of Highbury society with the arrival of Jane and then Mrs Elton , the flirtation with Frank , the disaster at Box Hill , the realisation that she has absolutely no control over Harriet's feelings or , finally , her own . A clear progression . If you compare it to the development of Elizabeth in P & P 95 or 05 , you can get a feel for how much more this adaptation is attuned to Austen's characters and purpose . Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth is exactly the same character in the first and final scenes whereas by Welch's final scene , Emma is world's apart from the character we first meet .

119643057	635556	Re : SILVER	Ello , ello , ello - [ it's the literary thought police ] oo's been deviating ? Personally I find Alec more sinister when he returns than in the early Trantridge scenes . What Hardy is attributing to Alec is obsessive lust , not love . Alec's bachelor status isn't down to unrequited love for Tess , it's a permanent state of inability to form relationships with other human beings . His ' kindnesses ' to Tess's family are simply part of the bargaining process to get Tess back in his bed . I have met people who suffer from obsessive love of other individuals and it is a disastrous malady . Tess is cursed by Alec's pursuit of her again and again and again . It costs her her virginity , her homelife , her honeymoon and prospects of happy married life . It costs her all chance of a reconciliation and finally it costs her her life . She kills him because she cannot see any other possible solution to her problems not because Angel has recommended it as a precursor to happily married life . And Tess's antecedence is an important theme in the book but the idea that this is bad Durbeyfield blood surfacing in violence rather than malign fate punishing the innocent seems very odd to me given Hardy's well known views .
163158419	635556	Re : Toby Jones	Here's the thing . Actors of the quality of Jones , McCrory etc . ( with Nighy still to come ! ) would very quickly highlight any deficiency in those playing The Doctor . They have not . Couldn't possibly agree more . The presence of McCrory , Jones and Nighy mean that there is no actor beyond the call of the producers and the quality of Smith and Gillan means there is nothing they need hold back for . There aren't any better female actors than Helen McCrory .

123343327	635556	Re : RAF BOMBER COMMAND FILMS	Len Deighton's Bomber was dramatised by the BBC for radio in 1995 and broadcast in episodes in real time throughout a single day . More people were listening to the final episode , which went out after midnight , than the preceding parts as the audience built by word of mouth throughout the day . It's very good and available from BBC http www bbcshop com History Bomber invt 9780563523550 Appointment in London is an excellent film with a lot of actual footage and explains why RAF nightime bombing was often more accurate than American daylight raids . 633 Squadron has lots of Mossies , WW2 best aircraft , bombing Norway .
134317269	635556	Re : Maybe I just don't get it	It's not a culture thing . IME the majority of Americans are suckers for good British TV . Though there aren't nearly so many as in the US , there are plenty of people in the UK who don't like Black Adder either . If you're worried about bullying or unnecessary violence , you've missed the wavelength completely . It's to do with , to use Hollywood parlance , comfort zones . You are forced out of them from the first moment of the first episode as they turn history on its head . The indulgence in prejudice , racism and arrogance is both to test your own prejudices and furnish new perspectives . Watch , for example , what is going on in " your highness , your highness " in the last episode of Series III . It's incredibly sharp writing backed up by absolutely tremendous performances . In fact , Miranda Richardson's Queen Elizabeth may well be the strongest comic performance since the days of Charlie Chaplin . And one of the beauties of it is that it takes a while to fully appreciate it .

13037300	3009456	Re : what the hell . . . ? ? ?	Guys and gals , this is a Hong Kong movie called Naked Weapon and the box has a pictures of the leading ladies together nude ( insinuated ) , lets be honest expectations for a well scripted / edited / acted movie should be left at the door . But I enjoyed it , for all the flaws ( I thought the editing was particularly terrible especially in the cage fight ) it was a good way to kill sometime . There were the good bits such as some of the fight scenes when they were not being slaughtered by the editor and the fact that it would have been all too easy to make out Kat and Charlene were having a lesbian affair but they managed to keep it to more of a sisterly love which was good . I think the rape scene whilst nessecary was handelled poorly , it was long to the point of being uncomfortable . I think though when you look at some of the sheer rubbish Hollywood chucks at us ( Van Helsing , Troy , Day after tomorrow ) this really is not that bad . PS to our american friend ( sorry i have forgotten your name ) you really should not take things so seriously just chill .

154116238	3046256	Re : Holy is this backwards . . .	I think drale makes a point though , windowlicker . They're just showing how it would be if Noah and the ark was a present day story . No one listened to Noah and all thought he was crazy , just like they did for Evan . Just because a man like Evan goes around saying " there's going to be a flood , God told me so - - get on the ark ! " doesn't mean the most Christian people are going to listen to him and come flooding on to the boat . I don't want to put myself out there , however I have no better example to give you , but I'm a Christian , and I believe what God says is true . If I was in a drought like the people of Virginia in this movie were , I would somewhat doubt that a man could predict the exact date that it would rain , even if he does claim that God told him so . Mostly because we wouldn't know if this guy was for real or faking it . That's the problem with Christian people these days - - people can go around saying God told them this and that in their dreams and we choose to either accept it or not believe it at all unless it was actually happening to US .

111960726	3046256	Question	When they send a girl home , you see her walking off the stage and out the auditorium with no luggage . When do they get their stuff together ? The girls are either in the dressing room or back at the hotel . If they're in the dressing room , they are probably sent home after the girl leaves , but I'm sure they'd notice who went home if they saw an empty area in the bedrooms . If they're back at the hotel , they'd see the girl getting her stuff together , making the whole entrance of those that didn't get cut completely fake when they already knew . And surely they don't make the girls pack everything up and bring it to each audition . They're GIRLS ! They probably bring more than just a few items . And I'm sure the director and whatnot don't get their things together for them and have it waiting outside . . . they have things all over the hotel , it'd be impossible to know what belongs to who . So , I can't seem to figure out how they leave the casting office without luggage . I think their rooms are all combined together . . . aren't they ?

Like when they included " Hopelessly Devoted to you " I thought that part was useless since they included the song that it replaced in the movie " It's raining on prom night " It was overkill . I was actually in a community theatre production of Grease last summer . Do they sing " You're the One that I want ? " in the broadway production ? Because ours was instead a song called " All Choked Up " My favorite song thats NOT in the movie is in the show . I can't remember the name of it . . .

She was my LEAST favorite , I can't believe she made it so far . I know there's the saying " there's no small parts , only small actors " but HEY . Rhiannon's part is still bigger than Lauren's ! Rhiannon gets her own solos , her own lines , everything .

I usually don't find things " big deals " until I hear more details and really understand what a tragedy both things were .

I just ignored it and went back to bed . Then my Mom woke me up that same morning , who has followed him since day one of " The Crocodile Hunter " series , and she told me what had happened .

The judges let them down easily ; I can't stand the crap that comes out of Simon Cowell's mouth anymore on AI . And I LOVE that they don't just hold open casting calls , they have videos sent from around the US in small towns and go surprise them ? That's amazing .

He said that he's heard nothing but good things from people that have worked with her . That's what I want her to be known for - - being a sweet , kind person that gets work because of THAT , not because she exposes her boobs . Danielle , if you'r reading this , please don't do this .

Not the landscape painted scenes , the ones with real buildings . Most shots are from the ground looking up ( I suppose to cut out any " 20th " century things from view ) For example the power station in Plot to kill a city Part 2 . In one shot you see an angular concrete building that juts out above the camera . They could be some sort of stock footage I suppose , but they seem to be using post-modern buildings a lot .

5398127	2044056	Re : i HATE it	< Yes , TV promotes all kinds of crap , and you want to be consistent in your opinions . I don't appreciate the fact that you have singled out Hip-Hop to be a medium for violence , etc . If you don't like Hip-Hop that's you , but dont single it out like that . Not cool . > I was not inconsistent in anything . I don't have to like anything but we were discussing this genre , so that is what I discussed . If we have to go into it , I will say No Doubt's video needs to be viewed in context : as satire , just as Eminem's videos are . Doesn't mean I think they promote a positive message but the intent is clearly different . Rap ( in general ) on MTV is a lifestyle of decadence , alternative rock ? not necessarily so . I don't have to like it , and yes , I can single it out if I want to . It is my opinion and I stand by it . I'm not trying to be cool or controversial , just frank . < In the same way , people aspire to be rappers . Nothing wrong with that . We are a capitalistic society and where there is money to be made , someone's making it ! > A lifestyle as an artist ? I'm completely behind it , being one myself . But I don't have to like every type of art do I ? And yes , I do think there's something wrong with our capitalistic society , and I think it's unfortunate that so many people see the greedy pursuit of fame and fortune as desirable .

4756080	2044056	Re : i HATE it	> When I was a kid , " ni * * * " was the most hateful thing a person could say . Now it's a term of endearment used by ALL races , and has little impact at all . < " Endearment " ? I fail to see how embracing formerly offensive words is a good thing . A derogatory term is a derogatory term - I am skeptical that embracing words that were once considered offensive is a sign of our culture moving forward . Frankly , I'd like to see a caucasian greet an african american stranger with " what's up ni * * * " without some misunderstanding taking place . Desensitization is what is happening , not acceptance . There is a huge , huge difference . > The same thing is going to happen with today's hip hop generation . They won't stay 18 forever ! ! I say let kids have their fun . < I am 19 . And everytime I am reminded that I will go down in history along with my peers as the " hip-hop " generation I want to scream . I dislike Hip-hop ( as MTV knows it ) personally because I don't see the promotion of violence , objectifying of women , and worship of the Almighty Dollar as a good direction for any culture to move in . I don't think that the pursuit of such a lifestyle is something to look forward to , and it breaks my heart when I hear 12-year-olds speaking in strings of cusses because they think it's " cool " or " tight " or whatever the word is now . There is rap out there that is not about these things , and it is unfortunate that those groups generally do not dominate the airwaves . Unfortunately I think I speak on behalf of a minority of my generation . > As far as my comment with whites stealing from blacks , I don't see how that comment can even be disputed . < So . . . . whenever a " white " person dabbles in a " black " art form it's stealing . In what way does this comment not promote segregation ? Why does it matter that they are white / black / orange / purple / green ? You speak of unification and then anyone who has intergrated a " black " artform into their art is a thief . Yup , that sounds fair .
4778177	2044056	Re : i HATE it	> Words change all the time , and amongst the hip hop generation , yes the " N " word has become a term of endearment . Just because you're unfamiliar with someone else's world doesn't mean it does not exist . < I find it interesting that you group my age group ( 18 ) into the hip hop generation and then pretty much disregard my opinion of my own generation because it's " someone else's world . " Among the many conversations I've engaged in within many social circles , the " N " word is offensive . Please don't presume you know my world's boundaries just because I disagree with you . Just because the term exists does not mean it's right . And " bad " ? " bad " is not a term formerly dressed in racism and inequality , nor was its root found in the enslavement of a culture / race . Take the word " gay " - people use it all the time like it's nothing - does this make it less offensive to gays ? I somehow doubt it . For some reason , things that are disgusting / irritating / odd are always laballed by individuals I consider intelligent humans as , " that's so gay ! " And I have to cringe everytime . Slangs toward orientation / cultures / races can become as common as it wishes to be - it does not lessen the harshness of the original meaning / intent or lack of regard it has towards fellow human beings , and I believe that any person with a decent vocabulary can step around it . > For true hip hop artists , I suggest you guys to look up artists like De La Soul , A Tribe Called Quest , Souls of Mischief , KRS One , Guru , Mobb Deep , The Pharcyde , Wu Tang Clan , and Redman just to name a few . Please , people don't think hip hop is about violence and misogyny , because it isn't . It's a way of life . < Actually , I did agree with you about this - What I meant by my post was that Hip-Hop as promoted by MTV is a life-style in which those images I find offensive exist . My point was that it is unfortunate that from the general public's POV the obscenity is what is associated with Hip-Hop ( regardless of how inaccurate it may be ) - and I don't wish to be considered a part of that just because I am of this generation . I think it's great that you mentioned artists that are , really , the essence of the what the artform is truly about - I just don't think it's accurate to completely disregard that there are negatives just as there are merits . Hip-Hop as mass media knows it does promote the idea of an almost immorally extravagant lifestyle - and many artist who claim to be Hip-Hop do uphold that negative image . Hip-Hop may not just be music - but the music is pretty much the portal through which the lifestyle is promoted to the masses . I don't see how you can discuss hip-hop without discussing the product - the music - of that movement .

32487253	8591456	Re : most boring film ! !	This was one of the most memorable films of my childhood , and I hadn't seen it since it came out in the cinema in England when I was seven years old , until I was given a DVD of it again today , thirty-one years later . Although today it didn't have me rolling in the aisles or have me doing Peter Ustinov impressions for hours afterwards like it did back then , it still was a charmer , and it was simply just fun to watch . It deliberately encapsulates a bit of the paradoxically innocent yet bigoted flavour of England back in those times , and there are many little delicate touches for those with an appreciation for the idiosyncracies of the English . Peter Ustinov is the perfect person to be given license to run amok with his non-politically-correct character , considering he was one of the most well-read , culturally-sensitive intellectuals of his generation . The film left me with the wistful feeling and hope that here was the England and these were the kinds of adventures that we had when we were children . It's something wonderful to look back to , even though it probably only ever existed in imagination .
164386475	22559156	* SPLICE * splits apart the liberal America from the conservative America	Just saw the movie SPLICE ( 2010 ) . Really loved it and female DREN . The last act is obviously a Hollywood hack job to wrap things up . so we all can disregard that ending . But the progress is very good , the journey unforgettable , and I care for the characters . Afterwards I read the movie reviews here at IMDB , particularly after its public showing since the beginning of JUNE , and it appears to me there are 2 clearly separated groups with a very marked line drawn between them . I belong to the first group who love the film , and I think it is really an art film in disguise . I suspect all the love or hate came down to one crucial scene in the movie . Yes it is very controversial , but also it contains a very iconic image that will make this movie remembered for decades . This scene separates the goats from the sheep . I think the haters are not really bothered by the quality of the film , they are offended simply because of that scene and just do not want more people to see it . The movie itself is of course excellent . It deserves 7-8 stars out of 10 easily . I think generally People in Europe are more open-minded and will welcome this movie . But obviously not all of America .
7375899	1326156	Re : What do teens and twentysomethings think of Hidalgo ?	Before I begin , I must say that I am going to explain what I didn't like about this movie by using the smallest amount of description possible , so there may be spoilers . . . I am 17 , and am a lover of many genres of movies . . But I thought this was hokey movie . It went on for way too long , and the ending was obvious . Plus all the little problems along the way are predictable , and not even well thought out . And the whole slaughtering of the indians thing is a bad cliche in movies now , I know it was awful what was done , but it didn't really add too much drama to the movie . The whole indian chanting part , that was really dumb . . . and so was the fact that he was a battle reenactment guy ; when he felt bad for what he did , and that he is half indian . . . There is just too much hokiness to this movie . . . it was good for a single watch . . . to waste some time on . . but this was no spectacular movie . . . The white man showing arabs who is boss when it comes to being a horseback rider . . . that's all the movie really boils down to for me .

141638420	21375456	Rockin ' horror film ! ( SPOILERS )	I just saw AF and it rocked . Especially dug the soundtrack . So here's the deal , I ( personally ) get the whole " low-budget horror film " genre . And I love it . And I have a huge appreciation for the filmmakers who bring this kind of content to the screen . While we all know horror can be popular , it is still the bastard stepchild of cinema . Funny , though , haven't most artists in this medium gotten their respective starts in horror ? Anyway , I truly thought this film was a great example of the " mutant hillbilly horror " sub-genre . SPOILERS - First off , the performances were exceptionally strong . The actors seemed to really go there and they were quite believable . They also had a nice chemistry going , especially the Brian character with the rest of the cast . The story starts with a bit of a conventional " device " when they almost squash a road-dwarf ( personally loved this ! ) but from there on out it gets pretty interesting . There's a whole story line that involves these actual whacked quotes from the bible that truly are in there ( I checked ) . I won't give away too much but it was a refreshing springboard for the story . Chris Jericho ( the wrestler ) was almost unrecognizable in the film . He did a great job and it wasn't like the character he plays on TV . His scene with his 2 sons and getting the girl to flash herself was classic . I don ' want to give away too much but when the film finally gets in to the farm the movie really takes off . I found myself really in to the story and wanting to know what was going to happen . The ending , I'm sure , will be quite controversial . It leaves things kind of hanging , like what happens to the main girl . But in my opinion , it was dark , weird and worked . The makeup f / x were incredible ( again , for a film that obviously didn't have much of a budget ) . I thought the cinematography and direction were strong . There is a fantastic shot at the end of the film when the girl is running across a big field and the sky is all blood-pink in the background . Anyway , I easily give the film 4 out of 5 stars .

163697148	21198656	Re : Allegory for democratic-capitalism ' s overthrow .	Capitalism is exploitation ? Wow . You would think that nearly 20 years after the fall of the Soviet Union that people would have left that Marxist trash in the ash heap where it belongs . For the public school educated - capitalism is freedom of choice by the individual , through the market . Under capitalism , you are never forced to purchase anything , do anything in particular or have your life directed by another . Its function is to provide for this free choice , not to provide a stable living for everyone . The goal of every business is and should be to make a profit . Any other economic system adds inherent irregularities . What do I mean by this ? Take socialism . A directed economy through regulation must create excess surplus and not fulfill demand for resources , since no regulating body can respond with the speed necessary to manage economic shifts . While I will never say capitalism is perfect , it is by far the best economic organization humanity has ever devised . It gives people the freedom to fail , as well as reach their full potential .

146325676	21198656	Re : A Movie For Pretentious , Political-Minded Snobs	Now , such wonderful discussion on what is honestly a dull and hard to understand movie . Before you loudly call out that such things are above my head , I understand politics and philosophy quite well , as these were my subjects of study where I matriculated . Syriana shows an extremely jaded view of the world , complete with the leftist orgasimic belief that large companies , especially oil companies , seek to move pawns around the board and dominate the Middle East . Stating that a film has won an award , any award doesn't mean that it is of any quality . For some that read these boards , they actually believe that the United States and the oil companies are the devil incarnate in the world , which is what any resonable person who can follow the choppy film will get from it . This view often as I have seen forces people who ascribe to it a certain laxness to what they consider to be good . Literally dripping with cynicism doesn't make the bread sweet . There is no character in the movie that a viewer can empathize with , leaving the watcher a complete sense of detachment and not caring what happens to any of them . A good film that truly wishes to make one challenge their beliefs will incorporate them into a villian , and make you like him . Showing everyone as dirty , with no one to empathize with , makes a hollow statement . Finally , this post was started by someone who called those people who liked this movie snobs . A valid if not elequent point . By the massive amount of ad homeniem attacks on him by his accurate criticism clearly shows that the barb must have hurt , even if he did not respond in a clean cut way to devastate his opponent . I gave Syriana 1 star . Not the worst movie that I have ever seen , but emminently forgettable . I might even forgot that I have watched it six months from now and subject myself to it again . How unfortuate for me .

164257790	21198656	Re : Why again Muslims ? ?	This movie illustrates to a point a basic foundation of philosophy , ethical judgments and moral relativism . Unfortunately , there are those who with their public school educations who have little understanding of determining what actually is ethical . Volley2010 , while not knowing it , has this understanding . You see , there are no evil or good actions that stand alone . To determine whether an action has an ethical component , intent and motive must be included . What do I mean by this ? Take this for example . A picture of a man injecting another with a syringe . With this information , no ethical conclusions can be drawn . What makes this harder is that often in the English language intent and action are combined in one word . Back to the example . The ethical judgment from the picture depends on several factors , from the intent of the injector to the history and mindset of the injectee . Why is this important ? Because , those who do not understand intent are often those who condemn the United States and Israel , and support those who intents are far more insiduious . They see only actions , and do not understand that there are good intentions , and there are those who have other intentions . Of course , there are those who cannot be reasoned with . Many of such are those who fall under the moral relativist persusaion , because they cling to their conspiracies and beliefs so strongly because in their heart , they know they cannot truly define them .
153083883	21198656	Re : Avoid Propaganda When You Can	Some people can't be reached . In some minds , there are evil forces at work , faceless corporations who pull strings and people act . In thier world there are faceless cabals who control everything , and and entire platoon of CIA snipers killed JFK on the grassly knoll . But for the rest of us , we live in the real world . Capitalism has lifted people up from the nasty , brutish and short existance that we have lived in before . The Corporation is only something on paper , and it actually made up of people just like you and I . It is business that produces the things that make our lives tolerable , for none of you could truly survive in the world of before . Throughout this period of progress , there have been those who fought against it . Called luddites , they feared what they could not understand . Because they can't understand , they create unknowable forces out there that operate with impunity , and only they know the truth . Of course since we live in a human world , nothing is perfect , and it NEVER will be . To believe otherwise is lunacy . But , what capitalism allows us to do is try and make things better . Only a people who no longer have to worry about their own personal and family's daily survival have that luxury . What this movie really states is that those who have this luxury often waste it . You don't find people hating corporations and capitalism in places where there is no capitalism . They only thing that they truly want is to have our luxury . And the only way for that is to ignore the luddite , and give it to them .
163691329	21198656	Re : Totally confused after reading all the sane / insane theories . .	The cave scene is the key scene . What Rachel is telling him is true , that people can be called insane , even if they are not . From that moment , everything is seen through that lens of insanity . Yes , Teddy was going crazy , but not because he was damaged into insanity , but because the staff pushed him over the edge . While the insane theory makes some good points , there is no basis of reality to them , they are just seen through the judgement that he is crazy . Everything in the movie can go either way , but there are clues to decipher as to what is the " correct theory " . First and foremost , as I stated before , the doctor in the cave lays it out . Now , whether she actually exists is immaterial . It is the words that she says . Once there is an accusation of insanity , even today the burden of proof is on the accused , and just how do you meet that burden ? You cannot say you are not crazy . Anything other than what your doctors want you to say , " reality " , and they can continue to treat you . If your symptoms are not convienent , then a new disorder will be created . Secondly , there are two equally likely explainations for what is going on ? There is no definitive scientific evidence presented , so less stout means must be used . What do I mean by this ? Well , all of the clues presented by the " insane " group can be explained another way , as Teddy started out sane and there is a conspiracy . The people on edge , the sadistic talk from the head warden , and the banter from the staff are clues , dependent on which theory you want to put them into . The guards are on edge because they know something is going on , and realize that if Teddy discovers it , then things will go badly . Human experimentation ( The Holocaust ) is recent memory for them . As to everyone being in on it , this is the same situation that occurred in Nazi Germany . People knew about the death camps . The head warden was like a death camp commandant , a type of person most would consider to be sadistic . Thirdly , the anagrams can be constructed as part of the delusion presented to Teddy . The prisoners names and the name of Leddis are not even mentioned by Teddy until after having a cigarette with Chuck on the boat . The purpose of drawing the marshal there is to discredit him , since he is seeking information on what is happening there . Insanity is a nearly unbeatable method of discreditment . From the first scene on the boat , Teddy is drawn into a carefully constructed world . But , why not just drag him down when he arrives and drug him ? The reason is why the Nazi's used gas . Even though many people worked at the death camps , a way had to be constructed to avoid emotional attachment to the prisoners . Shooting them was not good enough , as the murderer can look them in the eye . If they only turn a gas handle , and each job leading up to the chamber is done by different people , then each can convince themselves that they aren't murderers . For Teddy , to soothe their conscience they have to play small parts to drive him crazy , so they can assuage their guilt and lie to themselves , " well he was actually crazy , so we had to " help " him " . Thus no one person is guilty for it . But is this actually possible ? Forget for a moment that it is a movie , and thus fiction . Is it possible to drive the sane crazy ? Very much so . So why is this according to some a less plausible theory ? Well , it is because our modern world has convinced some of us that the simplest solution is always correct . This is the only real reason why the insane theory is a likely choice over the sane one . There are clues that point to each theory , and it is only which theory that one believes which truly gives evidence to support it . Now it can be said that what I have said also applies to myself . I cannot disagree with that . Movies , like works of art , are interpreted though the eyes of its audience . Even if the artist has a message in mind , the transmission of this depends on the mindset of the audience . When the message is clearly muddled and confusing , then any conclusions must be drawn from what the audience brings to it . I support the sane theory , if that isn't obvious . But each theory is on the same playing field . I hope everyone enjoyed the movie , because I sure did .
149300143	21198656	Re : So two of the three now admit to attending terroist training camps .	Well , lets add a little realism to the movie . Since by all real accounts , these people were suspect in terms being linked to terrorists , and that at the very least thier repeated bleating that they were not terrorists , it would stand to reason that all things being equal , that these men are not clean . Sure , it might not be enough to convict in a court , but that level of proof is not realistic in the real world . Intelligence can't get to that level of scrutiny . If nothing else , their behavior is quite suspect , and there should be enough reasonable doubt to disbelieve anything that they might say . Of course a real terrorist would make up a story about why they were there , and say that they weren't a terrorist . They would deny deny deny , and when they got a chance paint their captuers in a poor light . These accusations of mistreatment should be treated as what they truly are , propaganda . Their behavior leading up to and throughout their side of the story leads to only one logical conclusion . It is a true fanatic that can withstand the greatest pressure . A truly innocent man does not have that reserve . They would lie long before , if only to receive a small break . These men maintained their innoscence until long out of U . S . control . The true merit of this film is to show how some have been duped by our enemies into producing propaganda for them .
141326698	21198656	Re : Captain Planet sucked !	You darned right ! Captain Planet sucked big time , and I rooted for Captain Pollution every time , because even at my young age I could see the indoctrination that the show wanted to push on young minds . This vile piece of propaganda didn't deserve airtime , but at least sometimes that put true heroes like Captain Pollution who fought against the gay Captain Planet and his five butt buddies .
164261487	21198656	Re : Torturing to save lives is the moral thing to do	Intelligence give liberal views ? Huh ? Not likely . However , the point made here is that some people just don't understand , and forgive me if feel the need to explain it in terms that everyone can understand . To understand a moral or ethical action , one must have intent . The English language makes this difficult , since there are many " loaded " words that combine action and intent into one word . This is important since a someone who understands this principle has little difficulty telling the difference between what we do to terrorists and what Stalin did in his gulags ( the Nazis are very overused , so I will not ) . If you have little idea what happened in the gulags , read the Gulag Archepelagio . Now to elaborate . What is H's intention ? Quite simply , to convince the prisoner that he has no limits . Every action he takes is to this end . His uneasiness with the process is not in what he is doing , it is because he knows that everyone else doesn't truly have the stomach to do what is necessary . He does care about those millions who will die if he is not successful , and is completely willing to see it through . But does he torture ? It depends on the definition of it . If you say that torture is to inflict pain with no object , then no . H definitely has an aim , a noble one , to save lives . He is willing to make the sacrifice of one life for many . If torture is defined by only inflicting pain , then as a moral concept is loses all meaning . He is willing like a military commander , to sacrifice one for the good of the many . While some might cringe at his method , you cannot deny its effectiveness , as the prisoner fell prey to the psychological terror and gave up some of the information , and would have surrendered the fourth bomb had no one intervened . Lets say that torture is inflicting pain to acquire information . Using one's own mind , how can we make a moral decision on this ? This is where some might call it a gray area , but in fact it is not . It depends on the information . I am not saying that the prisoners life had no value . What I am saying is that one infinite value is not worth millions of infinite value . Brody is shown as the hero , but she doesn't grasp this . H has convinced her that he will do anything , and she doesn't understand the game . Lets further add to this scenario . Suppose the bombs were fakes . Does that have any baring on the moral implications ? No . The actions and intentions of H do not depend on whether the bombs were fake . Now , if he continued after they were definitively shown to be a hoax , that would be different . H's intention would have had to change to continue . Why is this such a difficult question ? Moral relativism is the answer . Relativism ignores intent , as it maintains that any intent can be justified . Thus to determine morality one must rely solely on action , which leads to the indefensible being defended . Relativism is used as a weapon against those who are truly justified , because it reduces the justification and places them on the level of those who have done the same actions but with evil intent . Often , it is added to praise of those who are evil . Take for example the Mideast Conflict . Each side bombs the other , killing civilians en masse . But look at the intentions . It is Israel's intention to have a safe land for their people . It is the Arab's intention to exterminate the Jews . If you don't believe me , they have said this themselves . Now you could say that it is the Palestinians land , but truly , answer me this . If they truly forswore bombing and killing of Jews , would the Israelis let them live in peace ? The answer is yes . The Jews , if they did not truly feel this way , could have wiped out the Palestinians long ago , utterly exterminating them . There is nothing that they could do to stop this . But , it is not their intention . This will piss off the intelligensia who believe in the Palestinian and Arab cause , and who at the same time find fault with H . But to hold this belief is not understand basic morality . Sorry , but that is the sad truth . What H did is a moral action , because if it is not , then no moral judgments can be made of anything . Intention is an integral part , and cannot be ignored or explained away by simply condemning actions .
149300214	21198656	Re : Al Qaeda illusion	Damn right sir . Denying the reality of Al Qaeda is akin to denying the Holocaust . It is funny to say this , because those who deny the Holocaust are often supporters or sympthaizers to the terrorist . Unfortuately , there are some people who will never see reason . That is why we have men like Samuel Colt .
163696383	21198656	Re : Movie is an analogy to our present situation with oil ?	Going back to an agarian society would be horrifying . Millions of people would die , and the ancient horrors that plagued mankind ( widespead famine , disease , etc . ) would return with a vengence . Oil is like blood , in that it is what flows through the veins of society , giving it life . There cannot be an addiction to oil ( fossil fuels ) , since everything that we have accomplished over the last 150 years is due to it . If you don't agree , try to live without modern convience and " luxury " . You will most likely be dead by 40 , if you were lucky to make it past 2 . I for one don't want to go back to that .
162678398	21198656	Re : lol i remember studying transcendentalism . . .	Maybe , but most of us don't have our heads up our bums past our early twenties , and most of us are smart enough not to reject humanity , like the main character . He abandons his family , seeking mystical solace in Alaska . I've been to Alaska . It is beautiful , but it is also nature at its harshest . " Spoiler " Traveling into the wild , with little knowledge is a recipe for death , which is what came of him . He sealed his fate with the statement " human relationships aren't the basis for happiness " . Another person could have saved him , and if he found happiness in another he would be alive today . The hippie lifestyle is selfish in extreme , and to give little thought to those who love and care for you in pursuit of quite frankly a quest behind an unoriginal idea demonstrates that this movie is not about love , but is a tragedy of the hubris of youth . Sometimes even if a director wishes to tell another story , the base material there tells another , one that can only be hidden by the pretentions of those small minds who think themselves large .
153084932	21198656	Re : Why is this movie even being made ?	Miminize political activity ? Damn straight if it is crappy political activity . I would definitely malign a Nazi or Commie political film , and ripping on a film that sympathizes with a large number of protesters who are ignorant , manipulative or just plain stuipd is fair game . This movie is pure propaganda , as why else whould the Seattle police hit a pregnant woman ? Is that just to have human flavor to the film , or make you see the police in a negative light ? Adjust your thinking tuk for that one .
148907752	21198656	Re : Why r 9 / 10 americans idiots ?	First off , Kokoda was a great film . I heartily enjoyed it . That said , don't take my explaination of history for the uneducated to be a denigratation to anyone's military contribution to the defeat of the Axis Powers , with the lone exception of the Soviet Union , whose contribution is made larger my revisionists who hold commies dear to their heart . This point is unarguable , without the UNITED STATES , the Axis would have been victorious . This is backed up with by the historical record , as well as a thought exercise known as alternative history . The war progress as this , in 1937 Japan invades China . Chinese forces retreat into the heartland . In 1939 , Poland and Albania fall to the Axis . 1940 France follows . The British retreat from Dunkirk . America signs lend-lease , which enables the brave defenders of the British Empire ( and later the Soviet Union ) to survive the onslaught . For those of you who don't know , the US leased destroyers to the UK to keep their vital supply lines open . Without supplies , England would have fell . However , the RAF was successful in defeating the Luftwaffe , and the Royal Navy survived the U-Boats . In 1941 several events occured which saved the Allies . First , the Italian invasion of Greece stumbled , and delayed the Nazi invasion of the USSR . Without this delay it is highly likely that the USSR would not have survived 1942 . Second was Pearl Harbor . In 1942 the Japanese were stopped in their attempt to capture Port Moresby . The only reason that they were unable to try again was the Battle of Midway . Operation Torch sealed the fate of the Axis North Africa venture . It was American troops that knocked Italy out of the war in 1943 , and drew divisions away from the Eastern Front with Operation Overlord and Operation Anvil in 1944 that sealed Germany's fate . With the Japanese's fleet's defeat at Midway , the Japanese were permanently on the defensive , and could not match the industrial might of the United States . That being said , take the United States out of the equation . The likelyhood increases that the UK loses the Battle of Britian and following Operation Sea Lion . Even if they do not , the UK and Commonwealth does not posses the military might to defeat Germany . With the UK neutralized , the entire might of the Germany military machine is directed against the USSR on Barbarossa's orginal start date . It was British forces in Greece that assisted in defense that delayed Barbarossa . The Russian winter comes too late to save Moscow and Leningrad . Even with the expected winter counterattack , the Russians don't have enough material to defeat Germany ( since their is no American aid ) . Germany fights a one front war against the Soviet Union , one that they cannot win . It then defeats the UK at its leisure . Japan , even if turned back once , will continue to press Port Moresby , and since the Australian Navy cannot inflict a defeat the size of Midway on the Japanese , they cannot force Japan on the defensive . This goes even further . Lets say that you take out the German invasion of the Soviet Union . With the US's superior industrial and technological ( nukes ) power , Germany's defeat would be very likely . High Soviet casualties were a result of their tactics more than German prowess . If you insert the conquest of the UK in 1940-1 , the difference is a lengthening of the war , and higher American casualties as a result of the liberation of England . It is American power solely that gave the Allies victory , as it allowed the other Allies to remain effective . Yes , the Commonwealth drew the line in the sand , and fought very hard . They survived . Their survival allowed a faster road to victory . The Soviets did the same , but their " inevitable " victory came only after Normandy and Salerno . And for those of you who disagree , feel free to . I am an American , and while you might consider that to bias me , consider this . You have to the perfectly good right to be wrong , and I won't begrudge you that .

Some of the explanations for this theory are : 1 - if you remember when the final fight with lechuck takes place you are walking on a sewer-like system , this kind of systems are used in places like disneyland so the guys dressed like characters can " magically " appear in different parts of the park , also in those sewers you could see that there where a lot of costumes , and an elevator that took you to a closed section of meelee island , ( in which you can read a sign that says out of order ) also if you remember big whoop ended up being a ticket , according to some guys the design that the icon of the ticket has is the same design that a certain kind of tickets of disneyland have , those tickets are special because you can stay at the park after it closes and you can ride all the rides with no people at all , that would explain why at the eyes of " child " guybrush that was an amazing tresure that he needed to find , the only point where the theory hits the wall is on the scene when the governor is still waiting for guybrush in front of the hole , although she could be a little girl too who is still in " fantasy " mode and that's why she appears as a grown up . of course only ron knows the real end . I hope he decides to show it to the world and now that monkey island is going to be developed by tell tale games which has a huge amount of ex-lucas arts guys maybe he could give them the real explanation . see ya ! ! !
143201441	4429056	Re : Im italian guy and i want to know : is really famous in USA ? ? ?	Here in mexico their movies were huge in the 80's , every time a movie of bud and terence was shown here a lot of people watched them and they were big hits some of their movies were in the top box office for weeks , and they were as popular in video too , i still remember going to the video clubs back then and it was almost impossible to rent the movies of this guys as they were always rented . see ya ! ! ! !
143223587	4429056	Re : Im italian guy and i want to know : is really famous in USA ? ? ?	> amazing . we live in a small planet . . i guess you know muccino too is it that > correct ? no man , i have no idea who is he / she , to be honest the only guys from italy that were very famous here in mexico in the 80's were terence and bud , believe me they were huge here . some of their movies were in the top box office for 5 straight weeks , something that not many movies do even today . It's a shame that probably they don't know how famous they were here , and also it's sad that back in those time nobody made any kind of promotion for their movies , if they'd have come here i can tell you they ' d have been received as heroes . BTW you are from italy right ? maybe you know something about some rip-offs of terence and bud , they were from italy if you want check more details in this post that i started : http www imdb com name nm0817881 board thread 143201986 see ya ! ! ! !
143226600	4429056	what�s your dream movie with terence + bud that was never made ?	What i always loved of the movies from this guys is that each one was set in a completely new environment , each one was a different story with the same guys and i think that was part of the great charm that those movies had . I mean they were cowboys , spies , cops , they went to rio , etc . and every new movie was a completely new start . . . if they kept making more movies what would be you ted & bud dream movie ? in which place or period of time you would have loved to see them ? personally i'd have loved to see a movie with this guys in las vegas . Watching them fighting in the cesar palace , or in the middle of a david coperfield show , or interrupting the concert of celine dion would have been priceless , any of you have any ideas ? ? see ya ! ! !

50073140	4429056	Re : Robin of Loxley's death	it's very likely that it was during the end of this show which was also called legend , i remember seeing this tv show when i was a kid but i never really like it . maybe it was because it was too " real " for a kid . anyway i remember that i watched small pieces of the show every now and then and i remember that at a certain moment i saw that thing that you are talking about . it was very amazing to hear that robin was dead , and i DO remember one guy screaming ROBIN ! ! ! but i don't remember the part of the arrow , anyway yes i'm almost sure that it was this tv show , although i don't know what happened next does anybody knows if robin died or not ? ? ? see ya ! ! !

81262125	4429056	was george expecting mother teresa ? ? ? ? come on ! ! ! ! !	this movie is one of my favorites of all times , even though it has aged a little bit as there are a lot of scenes that now look boring , too much dialog of things that could be said in two minutes . . . . anyway the movie is great but for me the end destroys everything . after all the problems that george faces , a shark attack , he's feets burning in sand etc . . . . he finally get's the girl but . . . . . he doesn't bang her because she is an empty slut ? ? ? ? ? ? come on ! ! ! ! ! what was he expecting ? ? ? ? he could have known that the first minute that she invited him to her room while the husband is in the hospital , was he expecting her to read the bible ? ? ? ? i didn't like george double moral that showed at the end of the movie , the whole point of the story was a guy who feels old and without adventure . At the end that's why he goes after bo derek , why he got so angry when he find out that she was a slut easier than saying 0 + 0 ? ? ? ? that was stupid because that's exactly what he was looking for since the beginning . everytime that he dreamed with bo he wasn't dreaming of reading war and peace to bo while she was dressed as a nun . . . . nope he was dreaming of suking the hell out of the girl . . . . so at the end i think blake went the easy way and all of a sudden george changes in a moral guy that wanted a girl with whom to read the bible . So he get's julie andrews for that . . . . . . . . too bad that he ends banging her ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! now that's what i call an ending . see ya ! ! ! !

" i do understand your point of view , honestly i do . And i had no problem with it , however if that's what george was looking for then why in the first place he decides to go after a woman who is MARRIED . for a guy who is mad for the uninhibited sex and trashy life styles it looks to me that he had a 24 inches erection when he saw bo the first time , also he didn't have any problem for having sex with this virginal girl who was married but suddenly he has a problem when she talks with her husband on the phone ? ? ? i mean did he woke up when the phone ringed ? ? ? for me george was trying to get back the magic of his youth , something that he thinks is gone , that could explain the hate that he has for his neighbor which he keeps watching night after night ( not a nice thing to do for a guy who is disgusted with the 20th Century ) and he finds that chance of being young again when he starts chasing bo , so far so good but the whole point is missing when he sees this girl as a slut and then he decides that this is wrong , sorry but i do think that he had more than one opportunity to awake from this youth dream and realize the fact that for starters he is doing exactly the same thing that he is accusing bo derek of doing , but of course we man can't be called a slut in this case right ? ? ? so i do think that he has a double moral because he is accusing bo of doing something that he wanted since the beginning , how is possible that he gets mad just because that girl is not really planning to only sleep with him ? ? ? don't you think thats double moral written all over george face ? ? ? now that i think about this i wonder if he really banged julie andrews , i mean she had a son so she had another man before george , wonder if that didn't caused any problem in his brain . oh well guess that'd have been a great excuse for a second part : D see ya ! ! ! ! !
88501438	4429056	we need a new razzies awards : worst animation of the year ! ! ! !	I'm not going to waste my time talking of things like if this is a good story or not , or if Christians are going to see it or not , or if it was created for kids to learn something important . . . . . blah blah blah . . . . . . nop if that's what you want to talk about there are enough posts of that in imbd . What im talking about it's the actual animation , when i saw that trailer i wanted to sue the producers for making me waste 1 minute of my life in that . WHAT A CRAPPY ANIMATION IS THIS ! ! ! ! ! i can't believe that this is going to appear in real movie theaters ! ! ! ! the animation is awful , just plain , no real emotions , simply disgusting , toy story 1 is citizen kane compared with this piece of junk . It looks like a straight to video movie , i wonder why hollywood wastes money with something like THIS , when there are hundreds of scripts waiting to be filmed , how is possible that somebody creates something that looks like a 15 years old animation created during the summer by some kids who are learning how to animate . Does hollywood really thinks that they can steal our money in such an easy way ? ? ? ? and how in this world did they manage to get BEN KINGSLEY IN THIS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! jesus what's wrong with him , first blood rayne and now this ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? i'm starting to think that either he is on serious drugs right now or maybe he made one of those " around the world " bets that english loves to do , otherwise he really needs a better agent because his excellent career is starting to stink . if you want to see cheap animation go to youtube , there you are going to find crappy examples like this one , but also you are going to find awesome animations that make this one looks even more crappy ( if possible ) . and hollywood complains that the reason for losing tickets is for that halo 3 game that stops you of the great experience of going to the movies , well if THIS is what hollywood has to offer then i'll be the first one to ask master chief to beat the hell out of hollywood , something not too hard to do as any of the halo intermissions kicks this trash hard from here to the moon . see ya ! ! ! ! ! !

It actually felt like the director purposefully drew scenes out with the sole intent of making me bored . I totally did not care whether these people lived or died .

After seeing this film as a six year old I needed all mirrors removed from my bedroom and slept with the light on for FOUR YEARS ! ! I was unsure if the movie was truly scary or if I was just a big ' pee pee pants ' . So I tracked it down and saw it again for the first time in 24 years . The apparition of Karen is still very chilling but the acting is just so forced it destroys any dramatic tension . Excepting Bette Davis of course , everyone smells distinctly of ham . I would recommend it though . It is certainly an oddity , a horror movie made for childeren by Disney .

66060737	4495256	Re : Such a freaking stupid movie .	I would put it to you that the quoted entry from wiki is concerned with the original concept album , not the film . The following quote is also from wiki , this time from an entry about the actual movie . In the album , Captain Walker returns to find his wife with a new lover and proceeds to murder the lover . In the film it is flipped around ; the lover kills Captain Walker . This is perhaps ( though not necessarily ) the cause for a different treatment of the title character . In the film , Tommy's fame as pinball champion is exploited by his mother and Hobbs , who use it to give themselves a much more lavish lifestyle . Unlike other films of rock operas ( such as Pink Floyd's The Wall ) the album is never dubbed over the film ; the different actors sing the songs instead of The Who . Because of this , all the songs are rerecorded and some shuffled around . A large number of songs have new lyrics and instrumentation . Notably : " The Amazing Journey " has almost completely different lyrics , and the " guide " from the album is shown as being Tommy's murdered father . Pinball Wizard has a few extra lyrics . References to pinball are removed from " Christmas " . Several new songs were written , including " Prologue 1945 " , " Bernie's Holiday Camp " , " Champagne " , " Mother and Son " , and " T . V . Studio " * " Underture " is not present ; Only a few brief segments of " Overture " can be heard .

166995766	4495256	Re : Evidence to support Andrew is nuts + Cawley is only trying to help him	I found the Mise en scène interesting from the beginning of the film after re-watching it . Andrew is vomiting at the beginning . He is literally ' sick ' . And he comes out from behind a fence to join Sheehan . Also , compare the make up job on Leo DiCaprio . The whole film he has shadows under his red eyes and is pale and sweaty . At the end , after the lighthouse scene , he looks more natural , more sane . Just my two cents , more Mise en scène than hard evidence of course .

158997524	1667856	congratulations Mario on LOST !	One of the better directed episodes of the series . Artfully done , with precision . You pulled some incredible performances out of Matthew Fox and Michael Emerson . Possibly Emerson's single best performance when he said " Why go to Locke ?

164406554	1667856	Need help finding a movie title - another live action + animation	10 % live action 90 % cartoon : an older teenager or possibly 20 something year old - live action - who used a seemingly regular paintbrush to paint a world and was then transported to that world where he became a cartoon , there seemed to be some kind of flood . Maybe it was raining really hard in the made up world or something . Anyway , when the water subsided , he found himself in a kind of forest and there was some kind of innocent creatures who told him about the world that he was in . . . There were several kings . There was a Sea King who had a water bed made out of some clear material with actual fish and seahorses and stuff floating around in it . And there was an evil king who had guards that looked like long axes or halberds . . . anyway . He had this machine that was destroying the forest , he'd imprison or possibly kill the innocent creatures . . . . somehow the paint brush guy managed to rig his machine to where it all became good and made flowers and he became a good king instead , everyone living happily ever after and all that . I think once he defeated the bad king , he may or may not have gone back to his own world - live action . Any help or suggestions are massively appreciated .

Aren't there more fans for The Keep , Tangerine Dream , and Michael Mann than all those other movies combined ? The Keep is the only score by Tangerine Dream not completely released . The Keep is the only movie by Michael Mann not on DVD . What about these smaller DVD companies that release these cult 70s european horror films , remastered , with tons of extra features , on overpriced DVDs that no one seems to be buying ? Couldn't Paramount at least set up a website that fans can register for a copy of THE KEEP and then Paramount will only press that amount ( or say , 100 over ) to ensure they make a profit ? What's the problem ? Anchor Bay , if you're reading this , you know what to do . Does anyone have an email or mailing address for Michael Mann's publicist , agent , or fan club ? Has anyone tried talking to Tangerine Dream to see if they know what's happening with the DVD ? Or Paramount ?

151948242	1667856	Re : Magnolia : Director's Cut ?	Whoever told you its a " directors cut " is misleading you . The version that is released now , on DVD , * IS * the director's cut . PTA has had final cut on every movie he's done since Boogie Nights , period . The version thats coming out on bluray won't be a single frame longer or shorter than whats already out . Its 1 : 1 the theatrical cut , aka the " director's cut " .
165444745	1667856	Re : Don't look at how many eps each actor is in ! ! IT WILL SPOIL ! !	its accurate if all the episodes have wrapped and are in the can , which I think is the case with this show .
154337781	1667856	Re : Magnolia : Director's Cut ?	Dammit . It's not a directors cut . Not a frame will be different than what was already put out on DVD and in theaters . I already pasted in a link to a scan of the back of the bluray in this forum for everyone to see . Look on the back , and the running time is 1 : 1 what the DVD is . And the DVD is the theatrical cut shown in theaters . There is zero mention of a new cut , recut , extended , or uncut version on the bluray . PTA has had final cut on every movie he's done since Boogie Nights . I know you don't want to hear this , but that's fine . Truth has nothing to do with your wishful thinking .

62588150	1667856	history of why this movie is not on DVD	I'll try to keep this as short as possible ( but there's a lot of details ) . From what I have gathered on the net , as far as IMDB , Amazon , and many , many fan sites and forums , and direct chats , the following is * MOST LIKELY * true . I invite you to digest the information , and make it what you will . I'm not sure of the conclusion myself . 1 . ) I tried to buy the widescreen laserdisc in 2001 on Ebay and another buyer told me to wait because , according to him , the DVD was coming out out soon , hopefully in time for Halloween ( 2001 ) with possible commentary by McKellen , Byrne , Prochnow , widescreen , possibly deleted scenes and an alternate ending . He said the studio was hesitant about spending the " commentary money " on McKellen and others because they weren't " household names " . This was before LOTR & Gandalf , of course . To this day I don't know if this Ebay buyer made all this up to trick me out of bidding on the laserdisc , but , at that time it worked . I acquired the laserdisc later anyways . I emailed the editors at thedigitalbits . com and dvdfile . com telling them about this coming DVD . They sounded excited . It's now 2006 and still no DVD . POINT : DVD rumored to come by Halloween 2001 in widescreen with some kind of commentary and possible deleted scenes . 2 . ) Sometime in mid 2002 a new rumor surfaced that the DVD was indeed being worked on at Paramount and would be coming soon , again , possibly in time for Halloween . POINT : 2002 passed and no DVD . 3 . ) Sometime in early 2003 Martin Blythe at Paramount answered KEEP DVD questions on the hometheaterforum boards . Possibly the last post you can find from Blythe on THE KEEP DVD on hometheaterforum's website ( where many DVD editors visit and chat with us common folks ) when asked when THE KEEP was coming out says " The Keep is moving out of this year [ 2003 ] . " Whatever that means . POINT : 2003 passed and still no DVD . 4 . ) Many Horror , scifi , and DVD websites started listing November 2004 as the release date for THE KEEP DVD . Unfortunately , they also reported that the DVD would be in fullscreen and mono . This sounds more realistic doesn't it , especially when Paramount is making the DVD ( if you haven't noticed , they seem to care less about special editions , features , remastering , etc . except for Trek ) . Martin would neither confirm nor deny the much touted November 30th , 2004 release date . POINT : Many DVD websites had an 11 / 30 release date listed for a fullscreen and mono version of THE KEEP on DVD . Nov 30th 2004 came and went . No DVD . 5 . ) According to Martin Blythe , who is apparently no longer at Paramount , the reason for the delay is they " want to do this right ! " and " we are waiting for Michael Mann's participation " . On November 22 , 2004 Martin wrote me an email saying " some time next year . We need the director first " . POINT : According to a DVD editor at Paramount , all the delays have been because they are waiting on Michael Mann . 6 . ) To my knowledge , nothing has been heard between 2005 and 2006 from any studio . POINT : No official documented activity since late 2004 . 7 . ) I personally spoke with one of Mann's DVD producers for MIAMI VICE the movie a few months ago who told me his opinion was that Mann is embarassed and slightly ashamed of the movie and would rather ignore it and forget it . He wasn't going on record and he wasn't sure , but he was fairly confident of this . This seems to jive with other stories on the net . But it contradicts stories that talk of Mann presently recutting the film . POINT : Maker of MIAMI VICE DVD says Mann hates THE KEEP and isn't supporting it . 8 . ) One website said that Mann was going to work on THE KEEP DVD just after he finished Collateral and got MIAMI VICE going . POINT : Rumor . 9 . ) Tangerine Dream can't release the full score because : a ) Virgin records won't let them , ( maybe ) or b ) Tangerine Dream is mad at Michael Mann himself because he hardly used any of their score and re-edited the music they gave him ( even stealing parts from LOGOS Dominion theater ) to fit his movie , without their permission . ( Big maybe ) . I'ts possible Mann was waiting on Tangerine Dream to finish their score for THE KEEP and just used bits and pieces from LOGOS as a temp track , which was never meant to stay in the movie ( at the time ) . However , the temp track may have been left in because of fighting with Tangerine Dream ( he never used their final score ) . Take your pick . POINT : Don't count on an isolated score for the DVD . Paramount wouldn't spend the money if they could anyway . 10 . ) Of all the special editions you own and love , how many are from Paramount ? We know that studios like Anchor Bay and New Line put the most effort into DVDs ( Disney has of late also ) . What are the odds of a studio who barely supports DVDs , much less special editions , shelling out the extra money it would take for extras , supplemental material , commentaries , remastering old archival prints of deleted and alternate scenes , for a movie that bombed in the theaters , only the most die hard fans love , and has been delayed 5 years in a row ? We'll be lucky to get a trailer and the movie in widescreen , and that's if the studio is having a good week . We need Anchor Bay on this . 11 . ) UPDATE : " documentation : Studio Magazine July / August 2006 ( France ) article / overview on the career of [ Michael Mann ] excerpt / rough translation : " Critical and box office failure [ details on the plot ] This feature film , ignored by the filmmaker himself during his interviews , has not been released in DVD and can't be seen in theaters or on tv . " That's about all I can muster right now . There's lots more details to cover but I'll do that in another post . Maybe I'll write one on what may or may not have happened in the original production that dismantled the final product . Thanks for listening .

Hopefully we'll get to see it . If Paramount chopped it up , it would explain Mann's problems with the theatrical version . Thanks for posting the clip , its a big improvement on the original ending . Mann is the MAN and Tangerine Dream rocks ! " " I found the article . The restored 3 hour version [ a newly struck 35mm print ] was screened at the Prince Charles Cinema in Leicester Square in London on January 26 , 2008 . It was accompanied by a Q and A with the cast crew [ don't know if that included Mann ] . I envy whoever attended .

151938575	1667856	Re : Finished the script , the rape scene , some comments	You know , Charlie has a past with her , and they've had sex before . She was emasculating her husband , and he was a push over wimp , and she needed some strong , masculine attention . Of course , no woman EVER wants to be raped , but whether or not this was a 100 % rape is the part that bothers everyone , because she clearly seems to be enjoying it after her guard is down and she stops resisting . Its her old boyfriend . . and perhaps he's a better lover than her husband is . Perhaps she was lonely and frustrated . Whatever was going on , it was complicated and complex and she could very well have been afraid / enjoying it / feeling sick about it all at the same time . I'm very sure she would have felt very , very horrible after it all , and extremely angry to Charlie , but things dramatically changed instantly anyway when the other guy joined in . Then , without a doubt it was 110 % rape , she wasn't into it , and it was nothing but ugliness from that point on . I wonder if the new script has her husband finding out what happened and doing in Charlie ? BTW , I never , ever , ever , ever , ever advocate rape of any kind . No means no , and she clearly said it , slapped him , tried to fight him . She also cried . The fact that she probably enjoyed it is sick . That's why this scene / movie is hard to talk about . If you admit she was into it , you come off as sounding like someone who thinks rape is ok . If you say she didn't like it at all , you're just not being honest with the controversy of the scene . It's still rape , whether or not part of her was enjoying it , because she said no many times , and tried to stop him , and was overpowered . Not to mention that she was another man's wife . And whoever said ' well things were different in the 70s , with womens lib and rights and all " - absolute hogwash . I just turned on Maury Povich the other day and these girlfriends were choosing to stay with their abusive boyfriends who call them whores and slap them and punch them and bruise their faces , daily . These girls have been with these guys for years and won't leave . Nothing has changed , and nothing was gained .

62586342	1667856	Re : Quite unfortunate about this cut : Need a director's cut ! ! !	The reason Legend was restored was because even though both Michael Mann and Ridley Scott had studios messing with their movies , it was pretty much only Scott that was remorseful of this fact . Scott has never implied that he is embarassed by Legend . He just wanted to take it back to what he submitted to the studio before test screenings . The story behind The Keep is entirely different altogether . I spoke with one of Mann's DVD assistants who worked on Miami Vice and he said Mann pretty much has ignored and tried to forget The Keep . As much as my heart wants to hope that he's really working with Paramount to produce some ultra DVD , don't count on it . Even if Mann wanted to , can you name one Paramount DVD that you own that's a decent special edition , say , besides the Trek movies ? Paramount gives zero support to its DVD creators / budget . This movie needs Anchor Bay to buy up the rights , beg and plead Mann to throw them a bone , and if he doesn't , then they should continue without him and get interviews with the cast , get Tangerine Dream on board , and get Virgin / Howard Blake off their backs . If you don't know what I'm talking about , read all the user comments of this movie here on IMDB and also on Amazon . There are also plenty of fan sites detailing the weird history behind this awesome B-movie . It has the right to be ridiculed by MST3K , but it shouldn't be .
62844145	1667856	Re : If they released these other movies on DVD , why not the Keep ?	Can you quote what you read , article , author , date please ? I don't mean any disrespect , but I can't tell you how many times someone has said " I've read in - - - - - - that Mann says " and no one , to this day , has been able to produce documentation .
151948118	1667856	Charlie vs David , and Marsden is supposed to be the ugly one ? ?	Let me ask the ladies , is Alexander Skarsgård REALLY that more handsome / studly than James Marsden ? I'm a guy . . but lets be real here . James Marsden is a pretty handsome dude . . no ? Chiseled jaw , striking bright blue eyes , thick eyebrows , wavy hair . . So is this bad casting or what ? From the tidbits I've gotten from the script-reviews , it seems they are still playing up the fact that the wife will secretly desire ( a little ) Charlie ( Alexander ) , because he's buff and brawny and studly and handsome , ( of course he was an ex boyfriend ) whereas David ( Marsden ) is kinda weak and puny and ugly / dorky . Seems James Marsden was a poor , poor choice for this . Edward Norton , now , I can buy that ( who was originally signed on to play David ) . To me this is similiar to having Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt in the two roles . Any ladies care to comment ? I am seeking input on the differences between the actor's looks in contrast to the characters they are playing . Maybe James Marsden went bald or gained a bunch of weight for his role , so then he would be so obviously less attractive than Skarsgård . Who knows . I'll check back to see your comments . Again , I'm a guy , so I have no clue as to what women like .

152083991	1667856	Re : Most SHOCKING + Daring Rape scene in Cinematic History	" What is shocking about the rape in Straw Dogs is that this happens in reality - women are betrayed by their feelings and they are stimulated against their will " Yobros , how do you know this ? I mean , if you're going to go ahead and be absolutely blunt and just say that , I'm going to be just as blunt . From what I've heard and read , typically in a rape scenario the female's genitalia doesn't respond sexually to the assault ( as opposed to how it normally would respond sexually to an invited guest ) , in other words , the organ doesn't swell with blood and there is zero lubrication , and 9x out of 10 , in the rape cases , the female almost always experiences some very painful tearing because of that . But I guess if you're going to say " women are stimulated against their will because they can't help it and control their feelings " , go right ahead . If you also want to say that every single guy who gets forcefully raped against his will by any woman , can't help but get erect , well , thats just about as stupid . Here's a different comment I'd like to make on your take on the above : feelings tend to mean jack . So if your mind / heart / conviction is telling you something is wrong , it doesn't matter what your " feelings " say . Stop living by your feelings . The " betray " you , as you just said . Too many women base crucial life-decisions on feelings . Feelings were NEVER meant to be a truth-indicator . They are supposed to RESPOND to the truth your mind tells you . They are not a truth-interpretator . They are a truth-responder . Your mind grasps the truth , then your feelings follow up with a happy feeling , a somber feeling , a sad feeling , etc . Your feelings don't say " gee , this rape is ok " . That's your mind saying that . I'm done . Yes , I'm pissed off at what you said . Guys , if you want to go ahead and rape some gal , go for it , because even though the girl will resist and say no , her " feelings will betray her " and she'll be stimulated against her will . Keep at it , keep going , and soon enough she'll love you and enjoy it . She can't help it . She can't control her feelings , and is a slave to them . You're guaranteed to get a girlfriend out of it . * beep * THAT

At one point during the pre-trial scene , Tuesday Weld recites dialog aimed at people who've seen the " I got something to say . . . " line from To Kill a Mockingbird , which is an in-joke aimed at knowing audiences . Then you have those comic drunk sequences which are very light in tone . Then it shifts into uber violence during the fight scene .

134507997	3903056	Re : A Special Brand of Bad Film	Yes I agree . I saw it first on MST3000 , and thankfully didn't have to sit through it without the commentary . This film probably saps precious life energy from you . Some Japanese research team ought to do experiments with subjects watching the film and monitoring brain and heart activity during it . The results would likely only support the strange feeling of being caught in the film's nowhere destination .
66958535	3903056	So How does the movie make you FEEL ?	I don't know about anybody else here , but I have fave moments in the movie like John's surreal talk with the starlet , aka " You're Him " , George's brush with the teen idol makers , the sudden song playing in the train scene , but how do you feel at the end of Hard Days Night ? I don't think it's so much a cumulative thing that only happens at the end . It's all during the movie I wish I could BE THEM having those experiences , and maybe I feel that way for the ninety minutes it plays . But that's only me , right ?
146483647	3903056	Re : Shooting Now in Buenos Aires , Beautiful	No they only shot there for one night , but that doesn't mean that they won't come back two or maybe three more Saturday's . The crew worked damn fast in setting everything up , then tearing it down and getting out of there for a calm Sunday morning for those of us who live near Plaza De Mayo . And no , I didn't see any film cranking through the cameras for this one , but did see scenes being bagged on a couple other productions here . The costumes are totally authentic and the cars were beautiful 20's models of all types . Whoever is advising Joffe on these historical matters is doing a great , if inexpensive job . I assume they're shooting in Buenos Aires-like Coppola did last year - - because labor , locations , and extras are dirt cheap , so you can't really charge too much . I am a trained script supervisor with over thirty projects completed , but I didn't bother asking anyone for work because by the time film is going through the camera , everyone's been hired already . It seems every production here hired the local crafty services because I always steal a cup of coffee at these outdoor shows , and it is uniformly bad in the same way . . . no matter if the show is an international , multi-camera commercial , or a one truck , hand held feature by some anonymous beginner .
25130356	3903056	Re : How old is Nevada Smith ?	Thanks for that . What you explained as the ending to Nevada Smith , sure that's what literally happened . We see him not killing the baddest bad guy depicted throughout the film , but that still isn't enough for me as a viewer . It's a piss-poor ending in my opinion . He has this revelation , but why ? Why not kill the baddest guy ? The film provides no justification , hint , or foreshadowing . Is this a temporary change or does he hunt down the Karl Malden character later ? And how about all the shots to his body , which can be seen as torture . So the film says that torture is acceptable , but outright killing isn't . Again Why is that ? The film doesn't have any guts , just like the Malden character tells the McQueen character at the end . It doesn't take a stand . It's " yella " !
24992713	3903056	Re : Liquid Sky Novel ?	The film came first and the novelization was done by Carlisle herself . I picked up my copy from Circus of Books in West Los Angeles sometime in the nineties . The novel explains Margret's character very very well , and it jumps around in time / place alot . For example your inside her head , then you see what she sees , then you listen to narration , then your back in her head again . . . In 2002 there was alot of buzz on the movie's 20th anniversary in the form of magazine articles and a special DVD that had deteriorated betacam footage of Tsukerman going over scenes with Carlisle and Sheppard who are doing lines that preceed the knife fight that they have . Doing research on that may be interesting for you .
82711479	3903056	Lotsa Baseball	When I worked on this last year , production had set up a shot of the ball coming off the bat head on , which could be a little dangerous . The camera and operator were supposed to be safe behind a plexiglass blind , however the bat struck a perfect shot which blasted through the plexiglass leaving a hole inches above the operator's head . I believe that shot is in the movie , eh ?
105108182	3903056	Re : Technically Very Well Made	Yes I should be slammed on some of the technical problems with the film . The shots match and coordinate in 3-d space correctly , but the sound was orrendous . Someone told me that it plays in the theater that way too-my sighting came from a burned copy from Limewire , so I expected glitches . The actress playing the part is very likeable and the filmmaker scores by making people who could care less about the subject matter sit and watch a long film with few highpoints . That's the reason for my post .
100294872	3903056	Documentary ?	Okay , I have to be mean : Lots of minutes pass without much happening . If you needed a bad example of cinema verite , it's this movie . Think about all the great documentaries that have come out since 2002 , and how the style is to jam as much info into the frames as the computers can allow . This film won't look like that . It's more like a kid with a camcorder shooting everything important and not . You see long stretches of Derrida looking for keys and crossing the street with other unnamed people . Hey look , I need a little something more than audio and video spying with no point . . . . unless the point is to have no point !

115045777	3903056	Re : A Poor Writer	I agree that it's a poor script . Let's face it , this kind of material is about as modern as a 1929 Model A ( Ford ) . Audiences are way , way ahead of writers by now . Did Spielberg and the writer really think that when they find someone named Ryan in the first 40 minutes , that we'll all breathe a sigh of relief ? They also kill every German they meet , dead , without ever checking for sure , and Hanks speech to his men at the radar station about if he cares about finding Ryan isn't necessary . The whole movie is about finding Ryan , so obviously they're going to keep looking for another reel at least . The first twenty minutes is a triumph of visual and sound technology , but script wise it can only say : Miller looks around his position and sees lots of men being cut down . . .
64065504	3903056	Fantastic Lips	I met her on a film set last week . She has lots of red hair for sure and totally hypnotic lips . . . oh and pale skin . I thought that she was Ron Howard's daughter , but nope no such luck . She was just lost and looking for a friend of hers , Jess , another young stunner blond with fantastic legs , so I guess that should be expected . When she told me that she's been working with Al Pacino on a play with her as the title character and that they both were making a film of it , I thought , yeah , of course . Everyone I casually meet on a Toluca Lake street works with Al Pacino , uh huh . But it is true . Thanks . Wanna go out sometime , Jessica ?
90919439	3903056	Interesting How to Pull This Off	The Runaways story has so far been told only by its edges , as in Vicki Blue's movie which didn't use the actual music or in aborted projects like Mama Weer all Crazee or Dubeateo . Folks who gave birth to the band got theirs in movies like the Rodney Bingenheimer documentary , but still that's not taking on the story directly face first . Kim Fowley's fervid brain cooked up the band's members and first album's worth of material . I can't imagine yet that movie goers the world over will hear the name " Kim Fowley " being spoken across sound speakers . He's notoriously impossible to court , and he and the former Runaways have unsheathed , naked hatred for each other . Pushing all this into the confines of a 1 : 85 aspect ratio will take no small amount of real um . . . producing in the form of wads of cash and ego soothing too large for the likes of this world . The book " Neon Angel " was indeed published in the 1990-91 time period , ( memory is hazy on this point which proves I indeed bought my copy from Cherie herself as did many other people ) - - this to the point of " unpublished memoir " ; but it sure isn't a script there . It's a recounting of events in the life of Cherie only before , during and after her lead-singing stint . Still I hope that veterans of the Runaways shows won't drift off in thinking that the band's songs every impacted US culture by itself . It's because they were so damn unique that their influence still inspires young people today ; how could it not . And another thing : we will never stop thanking Kim for his stroke of brilliance and guts ; even though he never wants to hear another word about it .
90936094	3903056	Your Films Are Like Araki's FIrst One ?	Reading the Film Threat Q & A for Midnight Kiss I was struck by how similar the look and themes are with Gregg Araki's first feature " Three Bewildered People in the Night " which is about young people deciding whether finding love in Los Angeles is worth it or not . That film was very influenced by French director Jean-Luc Godard and was presented in black and white with a completely re-recorded dialogue track to great effect on the viewer .
154541591	3903056	This is Welles first ever acting job in film ? ?	I believe this film is the first time Welles ever acted in film , am I right ?

If so , that is a pretty amazing introduction of him . No wonder the Hollywood community was frightened and jealous of him at first .

53254747	3903056	Sex Maniac ?	I was watching the Alexander Courage documentary ( Star Trek Theme Creator ) in which he mentioned Roddenberry's sex mania . I wish more people would spill what they know about this - - it satisfies my own voyeuristic nature . I surmise ( a great Spock word ) that Star Trek's creator wanted to sleep with literally every woman he met , and slept with all the female actresses on Star Trek , ( Nichelle Nichols , Majel Barrett for sure ) . I'm even guessing that he bonked Grace Lee Whitney ( Lt . Rand ) . What's interesting about Yeoman Rand is that she later confessed to being a sex maniac herself . After gettting fired from Trek , her boyfriend hired her out to sex parties . That's pretty intense interest in the sex act in my humble opinion . . . but birds of a feather . . . you know the rest . Often he'd proposition women he'd just met with his wife Majel in attendance , which would freak out those in his inner circle . ' How embarrassing to his wife , ' they'd be thinking . Yes indeed , but that places her in a submissive role which also happens to be a sex engine of sorts - - a co-dependent relationship using the psycho-babble term applied to this sort of thing . It's satisfying and " all too human " ( paraphrasing Dr . McCoy ) to accept that sexual tension and release was the warp drive behind the " great Bird's " power source .

28491335	3903056	Re : new age film editing sucks	Added to your comment , this trend has wrecked television watching as well . Video is not the place to cut for the sake of it . Best video is a long take with something of interest happening in the frame , and that's it ! Sorry , it's not film which supports a half second of cutting , ( check out the cutting rates in a film like " Lethal Weapon " and you'll see cuts of 1 . 5 seconds in length ) . The worst example of masturbatory cutting in video was a live concert professionally shot of an appearance by the all-female band , the Go Gos . It was shot multi-camera , and they just cut literally every two to three seconds regardless of who was singing or riffing or even looking . When the cutting style itself is distracting , there's too much cutting . In Contrast the ' 75-'80 season of SNL had almost no cuts during the sketches , yet launched careers and franchises into the stratosphere . Does anyone remember the cutting during the " Bassomatic ' 76 " sketch ? There wasn't any !

Also does anyone think there's any chemistry between the two leads , Gleason and McQueen ?

33449558	3903056	Did She Ever Have Her Own Stand-up Style ?	Because it seems as of this month she's channeling Sarah Silverman's style and topics . What a gorgeous doll though !
122096243	3903056	My God this is great !	Found the flick on a documentary channel site today and am enjoying it , especially " Beginnings " . It's so awesome to realize the kind of equipment he's playing through with all the open feedback loops happening with him standing in the center like a ringmaster . I feel like I did at 19 listening to him .
82347549	3903056	It Seems Completely Real	This film has a tangible quality you can almost taste . All the people drop their societal pretenses and a " Lord of the Flies " takes over . You see a Nazi extend compassion toward others , a lout ( Hodiak ) warping into a lover and leader , and a bunch of wastrel , rich seeing the dignity of the great fight of WW-2 . I'm a boomer too who only saw it on television . Bankhead is someone who's spoiled and incredibly sexy . Her romance with the Hodiak character really sizzles , and then you have another romance blooming at the back of the boat that serves up a philosophical outlook / comment on the whole thing . It never feels like it's being staged , you see the horizon all the time , and the sound effects superbly reinforce how distant everything is . The quarrels and murders that happen aboard are chilling stuff . I don't have " ironic distance " from this film thinking that it is some kind of " old movie " . I just lock into it from the start .
24073192	3903056	Gene Rupprect , Too Bad You Didn't LIve To See This	Gene , the San Francisco-based writer ( Bitch Magazine ) and Producer ( Malibu Barbi ) you would have loved this project . In ' 86 you bought the photos and rights for Vicki Blue's entire two weeks in the Runaways band , and even helped dig up info on Lori McAllister , the next bass player for them . Any Runaways news is good news , and you'd be all over it - - the inside gossip , the gay humor , the biting-the-hand transgressiveness of it all . If you could've lived past the early nineties , you could've read Cherrie Currie's book too . Fortunately all the Runaways were teens during their time in the spotlight , so they and their fans aren't really " old " in any sense . Lets hear it for youth and beauty .
90938287	3903056	Re : am i the only teen girl who loves this ?	The actual locations are / were still around for inspection . For example the book store where Bill discovers he's being watched , The Illiad in North Hollywood , isn't there anymore . I suppose fans may have to hustle because these actual locations are changing hands so quickly .
55165715	3903056	On Electronic Barriers	One logic barrier is : why do the Neptune Raiders insist on attacking the only place on Earth that has an electronic barrier ? Only that area of the world has one , yet the Neptunians never think of invading Mexico or Southern Africa , where the Earth resistance would be less .
61900532	3903056	Re : The ending	Maybe the ending happened , but not the way we thought it did . so ultimately , it's the audience's fault for not understanding the movie .
108042705	3903056	I Simply Like You Al	Watching the TV Achive material on you brought out my " father figure " quest . You don't have a son , do you Al ? If not would you consider adopting a 51 year old , expatriat living in Argentina ? I admire that you worked for Jay Ward and helped shape the Munsters and Get Smart , actually far more than for the awards you won for working for MTM productions . That Studio City lot , boy that IS a comfortable place - - not too terrible place for spending 21 years of steady employment . If you were the boss , I would definitely ask you for a job doing anything , very close to your experience with Jay Ward . My Mother the Car is a great concept , and I did watch it as a kid . The Mothers-in-Law , now that is no replacement ! Bill
82124925	3903056	An Impossible Job Done Anyway	Usually a single Script Supervisor handles the action of an entire show , and I usually can't believe that is possible if the producers care about a job well-done . It looks like the producers hired 5 script supervisors here . Not only must we watch all the action for matching , but they want us to learn new equipment for which there's no expert or precendent . Sharron and Patience are both graduates of a Van Nuys based Script Supervising school , Cinema Arts Tech . The other two have vast experience between them and then there's a Script Supervising assistant , an assistant ? ? I wish every sizable project had at least two SS's .
165541492	3903056	Haven't seen This since the Sixties	This is the kind of spectacle film that was common , everyday thing in the Sixties . But I remember it being kind of plodding and boring . My favorite scene was when the bell falls loose and clangs to the ground . Widmark and Portier worked the next year together in The Bedford Incident , another film lost to time it seems .
16583562	3903056	Liquid Sky Novel sheds some light	I've been rereading the book by Anne Carlisle which does a couple of neat things . Like all films , this one started out with clear ideas and lots more dialogue , but during editing , they played only the nuggets from the script , leaving out some " weaker " lines . Margaret's dependency on Adrian is much clearer and the reason why Margaret decides at this time in her life to cut her hair - - basically Margaret is declaring her independence even from Adrian . So it's a script " problem " when Margaret decides to trust the alien . Sure the alien is killing all the baddies in the apartment and even Zaps away the bodies once Margaret asks it to . Yet again she winds up in a courtship with the alien just as bad for her as all those abusive men then the abusive woman ( Adrian ) . In the novel you see the connection between Adrian , Owen , and Margaret . They all met for the first time in Owen's acting class , where ultimately Adrian first showed her the " difference between men and women " - - aka , not all that different when it comes to dependency and power . Following that , Owen lost Margaret to other girls and the city itself and is the reason he's so negative when they meet on the roof . He says " Adrian has turned you into a real , mean bitch , be nice . . . " Carlisle was also contrasting that the punk generation was truly different from the boomers , the sixties was over , and that the boomers were acting as " meet the new boss , same as the old boss . . . " to paraphrase a relevant song by the Who . But naturally Owen didn't see any of this . But I always wondered why Adrian said things like , " you're going to see Owen ? I don't want to see Owen , I don't like Owen , Baby . . . " Well , that's because they all knew each other . However , It doesn't make sense that Adrian would take an acting class . She's portrayed as pretty hard scrabble ; as tough as they get in NYC . That stuff is pretty middle class for someone like Adrian . The book cops out by implying that this is all Margaret's imagination , but why include the Midnight Magazine's reaction when Jimmy disappears , or Sylvia's date with Johann , or Johann's visit to Owen - - weren't they all meeting because of the arrival of the Alien ? There I go being too literal . The wonderful lines are all there between her and Paul and between Margaret and Vincent ( scabs , they are called ) and how serious her beating and rape was . The movie shows you the surfaces but not the depth of the sadism , the heirarchy of the abuse , that went on at the clubs . Maybe it's something seriously wrong with me , but I totally love and adore these characters . I'm not going to do heroin tomorrow or try being gay , but the world shown by these characters is so funny , endearing , and complex .
25356895	3903056	Re : Liquid Sky Novel ?	I'd make a habit of looking every week in used bookstores . Out here in the LA area that's an easy and fun thing to do . I've re-discoverd books that I once loved as a kid , but lost through the drifts of time and space . I'd look at used bookstores and try online places like ebay .
36729124	3903056	Re : worst writer ever !	Shonda also wrote the bomb story two-parter , which didn't blaze any new trails or " roads " either . Like Other good producers though , she's got a den mother personality , and other writers are happy to work on Grey's - - probably doing their best work too . Stick with what you're good at I say .
61900414	3903056	Re : Working on sequel .	Don't forget that the remake could be accomplished with puppets , no wait a minute . . . that's too interesting a concept . Nah , forget what I just said . To out do the original you'll need miles of film that once edited , still won't add up to a coherent story , pointless music , and characters that come and go with little notice . And remember , HAVE NO ENDING !
99207296	3903056	Thoughts on Fritz Lang	Having never seen this movie before and being starved for entertainment , ( Think of Sullivan's Travels , the Disney Cartoon sequence ) , some things came to mind . Secret Beyond The Door has perfect , glamour lighting and very impressive dolly moves for 1948 . The camera moves closer to characters as if sailing on glass . ' Whoever this Director is , he knows what he's doing and has a great crew ' echoed in my mind . Later it is revealed to be Stanley Cortez , the honored Cameraman and Fritz Lang the German Director from the twenties . Then the thought came : Michael Redgrave is offering an awfully stagey performance here . Did the Director even say anything to him at all ? Who knows what accomodations they made to the top talent assembled there , but Joan Bennett is pretty modern in the acting while her co-star is acting his acting . I literally was on the edge of my seat for not wanting to miss a word of the unraveling near the last reel , which is a good lesson on how to interest someone without using machine guns , car crashes or Kung Fu every ten minutes . So to the mid century Hollywood system , thanks for offering up the real entertainment for the starved , working masses !
84282201	3903056	On Hollywood Vet JK Durgin	Jim worked on the " big pictures " like Star Trek and Fantastic Voyage during the sixties using his iatse grip card , then worked non-union on this movie and many others during the second golden age of movies ( ' 66-'75 ) as a script supervisor / production manager . As a teacher of a few Hollywood trades , he trained Debra Hill " Halloween " who's productions inspired other female producers , then Jim's strong style launched the female scripties who commanded high salaries on Pirates of the Carribean 1 , 2 , 3 ( Patience Thorsen ) and Spider-man ( Mary Seward ) among many many others . He's 77 and is still teaching the crew skills required for 21st century film-making today . Go Jim !
18610878	3903056	Re : A Crack in the World	Absoloutely . It was an incredible acheivement for a lower budget film of the time .
54146538	3903056	Re : Best MST3K quote during Hobgoblins	Hi , this post is from 2004 , right ? Well you guys didn't have Youtube then . Did any of you know that someone has posted the MST3K spoof entirely onto Youtube ? Without MST3K , the movie would be much less entertaining . The film's bad because it won't be comedy and it won't be horror , and it won't be parody . When you have characters running to a van , which then rocks from the suggested sex acts going on , that's a very Mexican movie kind of outcome - - except Mexican films know when a joke's a joke . Things that are bizarre in the film : Why does Kevin fight with the guy on the lawn at all ? Only a total wimp would care what his girlfriend thought . Besides this , they're already dating so what purpose does proving manhood have exactly ? Why does the phone sex operator do all the voices . Isn't that kind of weird ? The creatures only kill people by getting them to live out fantasies ( which is a long-time , cool idea in cinema ) so why exactly do the creatures wrestle , scare and " fight " with potential victims - - especially not harming anyone , drawing any blood , or ripping any clothing ? um . . aren't they sorta small ? The Rambo guy happens to have a grenade in his van which doesn't kill the creatures , then another grenade blows up at Club Scum which ignites someone standing up and walking around . The same guy then rejoins the cast showing no injuries , even though he uses crutches . Would absurdist Beatles director Richard Lester want to use these kind of shots too ?
101881247	3903056	Re : Skip Woods = Quentin Tarantino ?	Someone may have pointed out that the script is too slick and mainstream to be a Tarantino film . BUT . . . how did this guy ( or group of writers ) come out of nowhere to write a fanciful , fast moving Joel Silver Movie ? ?
120942375	3903056	Aren't You the DP for	The First Day of the Second American Revolution ? I wonder because I'm trying to research that film , and there's not a trace of it on IMDB , but it's on You Tube .
26240975	3903056	Lots of Kissing in this Movie	I bet this material as a play , worked great . The performances are " big " and situations are big too . However in the theater , I felt rather uncomfortable watching the couple kiss so much . This was for a general 1967 audience , so you have infants , grandparents , teens and everybody else next to you . There's no music , just silence as the couple grind on each other . That's neat to me now , but when seeing this I didn't want to be next to my parents . I actually moved to another seat . I hear jokes in the dialogue , but they're not funny . Compare this with Saks ' other job , The Odd Couple , and you'll see how funny that latter one turned out . This one has sexy people in it , but funny ? no . As a time capsule for Fonda , it's great ' cuz she's so nearly hyperventilating in every scene . But those lips . . . imagine in every American film , if there was a solid twenty minutes of kissing . Donja think the world would be a better place ?
85827781	3903056	Ad Libs ?	Several bits seem unscripted in the film : the part where Witherspoon calls Mortimer " Witherspoon " , which then triggers several lines of them both correcting each other , there's the part where once alone in the dark house , Einstein and Jonathan end a scene by describing how he wants his face fixed . On that they say , " . . . I take this here , then I raise this piece . . . " while Jonathan is offering comments simultaneously . I have a hard time believing that those lines were in the Epstein's script .
77206183	3903056	Where did he get his start ?	I've heard of Clan of the Cave Bear but nothing else on the film list . Now he's working with Kaufman , but I sure hope that Kimmel understands that this film will be a tough sell out there . I worry that hack producers will take away the picture and re-cut for the mass audience , therefore cutting off my interest in following it .
80098316	3903056	Re : Working on Danny . . .	Cliche is a good word for it . You feel like going insane , so it looks like this . Abuse looks and feels like this . . . Every writer borrows from the same well , so every script has the same crap in it : guardian angels , angry fathers , drunk AND abusives .
166480891	3903056	Re : Fantastic Lips	I worked a week on PERIPHERY , a film which had been shooting in Arizona before they got to California , then fell apart . We were all lucky to even get paid as it was . I now see that they have a 2010 release date , listing all the producers who had split up two years ago , and they completed with a different Script Supervisor , who now has the credit for it . The actress was Jess Weixler , and as you can see , she's a pretty gorgeous blond in every respect , and had done alot of TV work just like her friend who visited that day . Both these girls are so beautiful that I was lucky to be there , and happy that they both talked to me . One of the Producers told me that his house , which happened to be near where we were shooting in Toluca Lake , was near a million dollars because of the phony economy from 2001-2008 , and he had only paid 140 , 000 for it a few years earlier . Now it probably is in repo just like the entire state of California itself . Much has happened in two years , and there's more destruction just dead ahead . I moved to Chile and couldn't be happier . Ciao , Bill
45632138	3903056	Just Worked With Her ( Hot Hot Hot . . . )	Can't say who I am , ( not very professional to gush like this ) , but I was at her audition , and she just smoked up the place with her dark eyes and sexy voice . So she got the part of playing a white trash girl in a Neil La Bute play that was filmed by students . This required her to grind and french kiss her male actor counterpart for something like five hours straight . Man , it was so sexy . Not only did she nail her lines perfectly , but she was friendly , outgoing , and not afraid of anybody . I didn't even realize she was British . The back of her headshot listed all these accents that she can do . I thought she was just another California girl . So back to Natalie . She was in blue jeans , socks , and a slutty top , grinding and rocking into the actor's mid-section . . Her makeup got all blotchy and messed up - - hair got into her eyes in that sleazy , sexy way . I still just want to give up show biz just to be her boyfriend , sit around the house and have her make love to me night and day . . . yes those are lines from the play . So " Go " , you 29 year old heartbreaker .
25472562	3903056	Re : Liquid Sky Novel ?	That's nice . Probably that soundtrack that just sold on Ebay for 50 bucks , which was the special edition soundtrack , has Tsukerman's full length pieces . That's important because all movie sound is cut to the picture , and there's much more of it that the consumer hears on DVD's and other film products .
55610215	3903056	Re : Did anyone else have a crazy crush on Dr . Forrester / Crow ?	I'm having a crush on Trace B . right now . I watch the Youtube stuff too . First off , who doesn't love Crow T . Robot ? When you see their earlier pieces , you realize how freaking talented all these people are . They're as good as Monty Python and much much better than any post-1980 line up of SNL . There's something special about Trace - - he's like the John Lennon of the group ; chairismatic and unreachable . You can't figure how he does all this great stuff . As Forrester , he makes me laugh out loud - - I have a soft spot for mad scientists . All this adds up to un-requited love .
55677448	3903056	Buzz Aldrin not a Cartoon ?	He's the second man ( literally ) on the moon - - a tiny Air Force Colonel at the time in 1969 , and so high strung that he punched a heckler recently - - I saw the video on that one . It looks like he's being presented as non-cartoon ; and well , good for him .
163782303	3903056	Re : This Film is Not Part of Welles on Wikipedia	I will keep that title in mind the next time the urge to see it happens . Yes I have the seventies disco shirt pictures of me to prove I was there . : )
83213780	3903056	Any Good Kissing Scenes ?	The Trailer for this left me with the impression that the title was " Oath of the Green Blood " and that once people drink it , they start making out heavily , falling on the ground in deep french kisses . Is there any of that ? Is there any kind of sixties debauchery involved like that ? I can rent the DVD , so just want to know .
159647847	3903056	Re : Wasn't he born in 1940 ?	Interesting , yes . Kim had been active during the early Sixties , had some hits , and then fully enjoyed the freedoms , . . . sex with everyone , that happened from 1967 onward . The music biz will probably never be that free again , but we'll keep watching from time to time . By " sign post up ahead " I am borrowing Rod Serling's intro phrase for the original " Twighlight Zone " , meaning that people entering Kim's aura exchange the real world for a zone where all is possible . Trans-gendered rock actually did happen during the eighties and nineties , Kim had paid for a record by an act called the Cosmetics , a group of drag queens in Los Angeles . This was in the late eighties . But what I meant is that all genders take a turn at being submissive and / or macho while carrying on as pop stars . It is probably a misuse of the phrase . Born in 1963 , you were just a shade too young to have seen the groups of that time . I was born at the perfect time for the Runaways , but I missed the hard core , pop acts of the sixties in their full bloom - - mainly anything from 1966 - - and this was what really made rock music fun .
16454435	3903056	Re : A Crack in the World	I was totally amazed by this film as a ten year old . Obviously now , the ending is an Adam and Eve reference . Doesn't a huge chunk of Earth hurl upwards to become another moon at the end ? Sheeesh , I'd call that ambititious for a movie starring Dana Andrews ! And they used much stock footage of volcanoes mixed in with new sets and miniatures . Today it would likely be thought of as a B picture , but looky : the new pictures for this decade are about similar subjects of weather problems , meteor collisions , and tornados . Where's my milk duds , you steal em ?
26247165	3903056	VHS available , but haven't seen it	I haven't laid eyes on this since the sixties , but remember that the women in it looked fantastic . My local North Hollywood , Ca . video place has a copy and soon I'll see it - - perhaps even comment on it , who knows . Jerry and Dennis Weaver are still alive , so's Connie Stevens . Is Anita Ekberg ?
102256314	3903056	Re : AWFUL ACTING	Mrs Collins and Daisy are the worst offenders , then you have a bunch of wisecracking 11-13 year old boys who grow tiresome over the course of the film . My vote for Mrs . Collins though for the single , awful actor award .
65403223	3903056	Re : Black the Ripper	Hey Scott , No I don't have anything on this film . I just want to say that Frank and my Dad were both lawyers here in Los Angeles and both figured in the " golden age of filmmaking " period which roughly covers 1967 to 1976 , not coincidentally when the average doctor or dentist ( and a couple dozen of their friends ) could finance a low budget picture that could uncork the cash spigot , someone's hope to be sure . Some of Frank's cast and crew still fondly remember him . A story goes that he made so much money at first that he bought Bela Lugosi's house , the one the overlooked the Hollywood Fwy , which he occupied until the state condemned it for the highway expansion . He then moved farther up the hill where he remained until being murdered . However some personal BB accounts say that he was killed in Lugosi's house , which reads better , kind of like a movie , huh ? My teacher in script supervising for this year told me this . He palled around with Saletri during the late sixties and relied upon the lawyer for contract advice for his " off the lot " ( low budget ) pictures that he'd production manage . They both liked the fringy female starlets and the brush-with-greatness moments that many in Hollywood take to the grave with them .

24992049	3903056	Re : Awesome Paula E . Sheppard site here . . . .	Wow , very interesting . It's amazing that Paula delivered such a good performance in Liquid Sky when you realize that the director and crew spoke very little english , and traditionally there's little rehearsal in films compared to weeks and weeks of it for live theater . The part for Anne Carlisle was developed between her and the director , so she'd have a better idea , lets say , but Paula wasn't as involved in creating her role to the same extent . In other words , Anne Carlisle wrote the scene of Adrian's performance / poetry reading once Owen is found dead in their apartment-but watching it is a different matter . Paula Sheppard just owns those words ! What's bizarre for those of us who adore Liquid Sky is that few of the cast and crew did anything as challenging again as this film .

35143857	3903056	' Into You Like A Train : ' writer for Grey's Anatomy	Apparantly the concept for a train crash was tossed around the writer's room ( Probably not unlike the Alan Brady Show ) , but then the job of assigning lines to characters fell to Stacy McKee . People can say all sort of snarky things about writers for television , " people who can't write books or movie features write for television " but I won't say that . Grey's has great writing . Most people think that Grey's is using Patrick Dempsey merely to keep the 18-49 year old women hanging around after DH finishes , but that understates things a bit . There's writing for the ensemble cast and special guest stars , advancing the arc , and balancing the conflicting needs for warm , fuzzy cast lines on one hand ; something surprising on the other hand . The plots and titles follow popular songs of the last twenty years , same with the title of " . . . Train " , the dialogue seems to be pre-timed and choreographed ( yes ER did that first ) to the extent that it's almost hypnotic like the old Johnny Carson vs . Ed McMahon routines . They're making real good show at Grey's .
155321499	3903056	Re : Slacker must have been a nightmare to shoot !	It was easier for the Director than anybody else , since there weren't the usual worries . The film has a script supervisor listed , but in single long takes when you don't cover any other angles and you don't return to the set ever again . . . well there aren't any continuity worries . Also there was no script , just characters and intentions . What is great is that the film is about everybody in the audience rather than particular people . In this way it is unique .
70736933	3903056	Check Out How Van Nuys Blvd Hasn't Changed	Since 1979 , the exteriors haven't changed at all , just put up signs in Spanish , and you have the current Van Nuys Blvd . Cruising ? With gas nearing $4 . 00 dollars a gallon , umm . . . nope that's an artifact from the distant past . I remember chicks looking hotter in the real-life 70's , than ever depicted here . But the facsination with vans of all sorts really was a big deal then . Sex was more casual then than now , but nobody has sex this casual except in movies .
100474250	3903056	Technically Very Well Made	Watching it , you feel like the creators know what they're doing , even if a moment seems interminable . . . won't end . They don't waste frames that aren't needed , so it has an action cutting style even though mostly the cuts just re-establish people in the frame . The crew seems so accomplished that they don't do handheld very well . All the handheld shots scream , " okay , now look at this differently ! " Apparently they don't study how we hand hold cameras in the North . All the Argentine characteristics are there ; mostly obedient people who kiss coming and going , and are afraid of everything , oh . . . and have more words that aren't in any dictionaries than any Latin American country . So . . the story kept me watching to see the end , and that's a filmmaker's real job .
69792397	3903056	Re : Ambivalence	" she is simply frustrated because she doesn't have enough to do , and puts all of that energy into the hope that something exciting will happen when Paul comes home .

She's in constant motion , inciting things or provoking things if answers don't come back in snappy fashion . These days she'd be given Ritalin and told to " chill , sister . " But of course who wants to live now ? A lot of the action makes me wonder what Cory's first kiss with Paul . How many hours / days did that last ? They must've had some scenery chewing dates before putting on rings . So yes . She's a real wild child , but now Paul's ready to settle into domesticity , and she must learn to stop stripping off her clothes to attract attention and be a lady ; late sixties style .

I thought that Broderick was a robot who had forgotten that he wasn't real and carried on as a normal man might . And I thought that Moore was benefiting from the arrangement as in " my brother thinks he's a chicken , and he should be cured of this , but we all need the eggs " . Also it looked like Moore was having a nervous breakdown , so anything she said couldn't be considered seriously by the viewer . Looks like my fantasy of seeing the film is better than the actual film is .

122182320	3903056	This actor kissed alot of women	in these low budge films like Motel Confidential and many others . The movie would stop for a kiss interlude where he and some hot chick would roll around on a bed in their underwear trying to french kiss each other to sexual bliss . Man , that's wonderful . Interesting to see him actually acting in a movie like this .
160023003	3903056	Re : Wasn't he born in 1940 ?	Interesting comments on the rock scene through the decades . Well , about the transgender thing , Cherie was a huge Bowie fan , so things just naturally evolved . How did you see the film so soon ? IMdb says the release date is in April sometime . In any case , I wouldn't know by looking because I now live in Santiago , Chile . So it may be everywhere right now . . . . wait , that April date , may be for Argentina . Anyway , I am urging my collector friends to see the film and not see a torrent of the movie . I did see the Runaways twice in my life , so I may be waiting for the big , crashing E chord on " Queens of Noise " , the song they opened with during ' 77 . but will try to at least sneak into a theater here .
37591877	3903056	Re : Barnaby Jones DVDS	re : jackryan10 comments on Barnaby Jones from Feb . 27th . I too am a HUGE fan of this show . It ran from 1973-'80 when I was 15 / 16-22 / 23 . The only current crime drama I love as much is NCIS ( a great " JAG " spinoff ) . However , try as I might , I cannot find Barnaby Jones on DVD anyplace . I don't understand it . I also liked Columbo which for several years were made in the same years . Not only do I enjoy them now on Anaheim's KDOC ( 56 ) for all the original reasons , but for many new ones as well . It's interesting to study the slower pacing of the scenes which ( in the ' 70s ) was still a lot like the movies of the ' 40s and ' 50s . The background disco music , the men's clothing and hairstyles , the offices with just the phone and a typewriter and so much more . My God , the guest stars ! Jessica Walters from " Play Mist for Me " was in several great Barnaby episodes . It definitely had all of the wonderful characteristics of those special 20th Century decades from the 1920's to mid-1980's when you could pin point what era you were living in . Now it's just one long , boring , repetitive present . At least since about ' 94 . Any way , I could talk a long time about that . The more technology advances , the more people are going just the opposite . Sad . If you hear anything , e-mail me at qxci05 @ yahoo . com . I tried calling Quinn Martin Productions in Culver City , Ca . which produced the show , and the studios are gone .

28146905	3903056	Re : Locations . . . . .	How lucky I am to live in North Hollywood where it appears some of the scenes were filmed . The Illiad Bookstore , where they first meet Shatner , is still there . It appears that parts of Toluca Lake stood in for the home scenes , and it looks like the North Hollywood Park's tennis courts were used as background for some dialog .
54289889	3903056	Not As Bad a Bad Movie	Compared to Monster a Go Go , this actually is a sincere attempt to make a conventional movie . All the elements of the film are merely badly executed copies of standard fare . At least you can tell someone is playing a piano for a sound track , granted that it's being played with someone's elbow . You have your cops who roust the wrong people and don't figure into the ending at all . The little girl's fate causes a mutiny among the " many wives " angle - - the people we care about lose it , and the people we don't . . . well they lose it too . The story could've used a re-write . . . well maybe a total rip of another story altogether would've helped . Michael settles into ordering Torgo around like a bell hop at the Hilton - - and this is probably where he goes wrong . He should have listened to Margaret's intuition about staying there for the night , but he's a man , right ? No further explanation is necessary . Not only does he drive until they're lost , but can't fix the car . Triple A ? Forget it because " the master doesnt ' believe in those devices . " Another plot like this wouldn't inspire people until The Rocky Horror Picture Show . There's no sense of raging ineptitude between the frames or just total negligence like in some others , the filmmakers just can't deliver the standard Hollywood " goods " - - no reason to hate them though .

69727505	3903056	First Credit on IMDB = US release date for ESOTSM	Yeah , so I've been working in the film biz for about a year as of February 2006 , and got one credit under a different name , Bill Gibson , for the short " Lost in LA " . But what's eerily coincidental ? The first IMDb credit in my actual name was today , March 19 , which happens to be the U . S . release date of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , certainly the one film that got me going as a script supervisor .
98726526	3903056	Re : YouTube Clip of The Opening / CLosing Song	I was under ten years old in the Sixties when my parents took me to see the film . I begged them to let me see it again , and they complied . We all went back to the theater . Watching the film is beyond a great experience in the theater . Not only Ann-Margaret's fantastic look and singing , but the numbers like Telephone song and Sincere which occupied the whole screen . Movies like those haven't been made in awhile .
65414752	3903056	In Praise	Bonnie , how can you work on Slaughter's Big Rip Off , with Art Metrano " the Metro Man " and Valda Hansen , an Ed Wood Starlet , then work on Several of the greatest movies of all time , ( Rocky ) being one of them . Then you work on a previous fight effort " Hard Times " with great performances in it , then pull off working on four of the most well known biker movies ever made ? ? What a mind boggling career . I bet you laugh at all those " digital scripty's " out there . - - Bill
163640197	3903056	2012	Does anyone think that Cohen will focus a story for us in 2012 ? All I know is that he worked on a film , Perfect Strangers , that had Anne Carlisle in it . She co-wrote and acted in LIQUID SKY , one of my favorite films of all time . In fact , this isn't even a film for me , it is a life experience like 2004's release of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . Both of these aren't even films , they are like meeting GOD for me . Anyway I am drawn to writing , scripts , low budgets , NYC as a location , and Anne Carlisle , born in 1956 , just like me !
68737235	3903056	Why George ?	From the looks of it , this was a massive movie production-maybe the kind that umm . . Coppola could undertake ? Usually executives don't take somebody who spent 5 plus years making a film about Rodney Bingenheimer , ( as important as he is ) , then give him keys to the Rolls . Good for you George . The film seems to pick up where filmmaking in the early seventies left off , namely pretty images and dazzling people , ( I'm a Bob Fosse fan ) . Looks like this is now a must-see film for me .
40938460	3903056	Re : VHS available , but haven't seen it	Seeing it as an adult one is reminded that Jerry Lewis was ribbing the all so important " space race " between the two great superpowers of the time . This was the material that most movies , including James Bond and its imitators , took very , very seriously . That's impressive for a straight-laced filmmaker like Jerry Lewis , so . . . cool . It's a hard movie to watch because it's so damn slow in getting to it's payoffs , which are pretty slim . Robt . " we take better care of you " Morley probably does steal the film from all concerned . With Jerry's character being so restrained from his usual mayhem , there's not much else going on of interest - - so that's an issue for today's audiences .
102256178	3903056	: Possible Spoiler ALERT	One telling part of the ending narration that sobered me was the fellow talking about how the dead are the most honored among the living townspeople , which has some resemblence to how " terrorists " who die for a cause think . I suppose humanity pulls out that old " you will live forever in people's hearts because of your sacrifice " whenever the stakes are so high that people agree to kill each other .
70737531	3903056	Just Saw Her in Van Nuys Blvd .	She's very attractive , capable and likable in this . It's not every day that films this low budget could attract acting talent . Most everyone else in the film is barely adaquate . She got a break from the tax shelter movies of the mid-late seventies so did lots of others like Bob Zemekis , and countless script supervisors , assistant directors , gaffers , and DP's .
83214295	3903056	Hot Makeout Scene at the Start	Implausibly this film starts out with a hot makeout scene with Dick sticking some of his Van Dyke down a girl's throat in Central Park in complete daylight , and the action is busted up by two very old , female cops . Well . . . okay . And , they do so because they think he's starting to shag her instead of frenching her guts out , but no he's acting funny because he got stung by a bee . . . well yeah , okaaaaaay . After that , none of the movie is worth watching IMO . I'm simply to shaken to concentrate after seeing this hot babe in the shortest of skirts getting mauled by Rob Petrie . . . I dunno .
74697006	3903056	Working on Danny . . .	I'm crew on Danny and the Deep Blue Sea . On the positive side , there's lots of male / female nudity . On the negative : it's stagey in a 1960's way . There are long speeches to the audience while the other character simply sits and listens without interrupting . That's very Edward Albee . AKA : too stuffy and intellectually " arm chair " for me . There's also an unrelenting grimness present as if the playwrite will not allow any light or other angles on the situation for fear of loss-of-legitimacy . Well he doesn't decide those feelings for me , I do . If he's the punk he's reputed to be , he shouldn't fear that quality in the audience .
160998942	3903056	Re : Some Bad Career Choices	She may have liked the scripts she was given , but then the audience is the final judge of whether the whole film works or not . As I said , " Mr . Goodbar . . . " she was very good IMO , and got nominated too . She had a really strong Director on that one as well . But I think you can say , unlike say Burt Landcaster-who was in some FLOPS ( the Swimmer , Go Tell the Spartans , etc ) but was never a bad in a role . . . you can say that Weld really was bad in some of these film role choices . But then again , she was really effective on TV , so maybe everyone should have a pushy manager who just tells you what role to take . That may work out best for the actress , the film and the audience .
54508451	3903056	Re : A Special Brand of Bad Film	Well it's good to compare notes . I must thank the MST3K people for hunting down these films - - it wasn't me who goes out hunting for them . They consider Laserblast one of the worst films ever , but I saw it in the theaters as a teen . I came away liking some of it . Even " Plan 9 from Outer Space " , though being goofy and illogical , it doesn't rank next to the psychic numbing effect that " Monster " has .
122178330	3903056	Got to Know Director Jim Shea and Actor Whitworth's Son	Jim Shea is easy enough to find if you don't mind going to Van Nuys , California .

I also worked with Jim Whitworth , son of the lead actor , who is a fine First Assistant Director , who coincidentally works on science fiction shows . . well he directed William Shatner during his career . These days are gone forever as the US disintegrates . See the stuff now while you still can .
30965567	3903056	Re : How old is Nevada Smith ?	So we disagree . I'm pushing you and other viewers to justify your acceptance of the plot points . Just for now , the film IS torturing the Karl Malden character at the end . So the McQueen character is now repeating the death scene that presumably happened to his parents , but at the last minute skirts away from it . Yeah , that's noble in theory , but we're talking emotional truth here - - and does that feel surprising or revelatory to you ? To me , it seems tacked on , not logical or even surprising . In a sequel , lets say , the Malden character makes it back to town filled with a revenge plan of his own . Again McQueen would have to confront him . . . It something that George Lucas might want for a super-long trilogy or something , but I can't swallow what the film proposes .
41627484	3903056	Man , what a babe .	Can't keep my eyes off of her bod . Anyone notice that her official IMdb profile also lists her measurements ? how very " Sixties " to do that . It's wonderful knowing that world destruction hasn't yet reached Kelly MacDonald .
35142676	3903056	Man , you got lots of experience	and if you worked on Barney Miller in 1975 , you got some age on ya ! Your participation on " Into you Like a Train " is really an inspiration . Nobody grows up wanting to be a TV director , ( unless their dad teaches at USC ) , but you very existence may change that . In 2000 , I got paid audience work on the Warners lot for Veronica's Closet - - so that was you on stage running everything ! I recognize your wife / partner too because I saw her at a local Studio City coffee place . Now to think that my favorite episode on Grey's Anatomy was directed by you , man I hope you take home that DGA award !
35142044	3903056	Re : worst writer ever !	Some of the dozen writers on Grey's Anatomy view their boss's writing as superior - - probably I would as well , ( if I knew what was good for me ) . But who cares if she's bad . Grey's is the best and she created it , hired the writers and directors . Television actually has the best writing right now . Films ? It's difficult to make progress when the product is recycled garbage from the Sixties ( Batman , Wild Wild West , Addams Family . . . )
70271634	3903056	Re : The ' Abby Singer . . . '	Yes , I came to IMDb specifically for that line that might have gone , " most well known by certain BTL types for the term " Abby Singer " , for the shot right before the last shot . . . " ah but as of yet nobody is writing such a thing for his page . His credits read many jobs as AD during 50's television , so if anyone would know the final shot , it would be he . I'd love insight about why he left production and went into a corporate job at MTM . The term appears to be universally used among TV and film crews alike , so bully for him .
56849809	3903056	Re : Buzz Aldrin not a Cartoon ?	Thanks for that . I'm amazed then that Aldrin contained himself for so long in the presense of that provocation . I engaged Aldrin personally about the subject of fighter pilots in the Korean War on the occasion of feting the famous pilot Adolph Galland . Lots of U . S . WW-2 fighter aces were in attendance - - this was in Orange County , California in the late Eighties . He's a tiny , scrappy , opinionated guy . He took offense at something I said and let me know it . Naturally I didn't forget it . Later upon reading the other astronauts accounts of the moon landing , they cleverly parsed their opinions of him , as in " we agreed that the Air Force is the best service for flights to the moon . . . ha ha " - - they knew he didn't back down easily , so they simply humored him during Apollo 11's mission . After that experience with him , I could read between the lines of other's measure of him . Nothing takes away his reputation at being accomplished and brilliant even before setting foot on the moon . Thanks for the well researched response .
99206018	3903056	Director Lang	On the same night as seeing Scarlet Street , the TV played Secret Behind the Door with Joan Bennett and Fritz Lang as director . Man , what different styles , and handled beautifully . The films were only 3 years apart . The Johnny pimp character . . . all I could flash on is Jon Lovitz ' typical 1940's character cracking wise with lines like , " yeah , she . . . shes the painter , yeah that's right ! "
63042586	3903056	Re : Greatest Legs of ' 67	I wouldn't let her have a break , but that's why life isn't fiction .

Being a weird guy anyway , this fits .
88606324	3903056	Enjoyed this at the Cinema	Enjoyed this in ' 65 as a ten year old , ( who could forget the locusts bringing down the airplane ? ) and now have the pleasure of working for the assistant director of the film who teaches in Los Angeles .

Those ads are the last thing I saw him in . During ABC's great raft of all in color shows for the ' 66-'67 , I remember Robertson's voice narrating the story of the Iron Horse . Well , with the moon program underway I didn't want to watch the adventures of being in the desert hot sun with your steam train in a prior century . You could just switch channels to channel 4 for Star Trek !
24074031	3903056	Re : Joan Jett . . . . . why , why ? ! ? !	Two things about your post . I approached Joan in ' 77 just to say hi and she reacted the same way . She was sitting with Joey Ramone during a Patti Smith show at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach . She is weary of fan interaction which is weird considering that she's a rock fan herself . My contacts told me that a few years ago the band seriously almost-reunited . Again the holdout was Joan . But everyone from Lita to Sandy to Jackie put aside their demands . I think that the marketing of the show frightened them , that maybe Joan would again be ripped off by greedy men . They always had strong egos , but can you imagine them 25 years hence , all grown up and some ( Lita ) with legit rock cred - - she was married to the guitar player in Black Sabbath ' fer crissakes . . . It's amazing that within the last five years they were all talking on the phone and exchanging messages reagarding a reunion show . But face it , there's no " newness " to the girlband scene . There's a girl on every block now who's got an electric guitar and a head full of dreams . There's even a line of designer guitars just made for little girls . I think it should've always been like that , but we all know that 30 years ago " rock " meant big , shaggy guys , huge Marshall amps , tough roadies , and nail spitting managers . In this new enviornment , there are 24 hour worldwide cable music channels , Internet sharing , docu-film outlets - - none of which existed when " the Runaways " consisted of Michael Steele ( later the Bangle's bass player ) , Joan Jett , and Sandy West who tentatively sang about bad girls one night in December 1975 at the Whisky a-go-go .

What happens after that I don't know . Haven't seen it in 40 years . ) Fate is the Hunter ( really scary airline crash at the film's start launches a look back at the pilot . Many of the tech guys worked on Star Trek later ) Hot Rods to Hell ( Has " Crack in the World " actor Dana Andrews fighting an un-winnable battle against Roger Corman-type motorcycle gang . Actually he just mistrusts anyone with long hair - - like many people did then . ) Atlantis , the lost Continent ( was 1961 , but the local theater just sneaked it one Saturday afternoon in 1965 - - it's George Pal , so you've got quality right there , and Paul Frees ' great , stupendous , wonderful voice narrating it . ) The 25th Hour ( Anthony Quinn having an adventure in WW-2 prison camps . I remember he just suffers a lot without any redemption , hardly a " Guns of Navaronne " , but the film just disappeared . It wasn't on TV . I never saw frame # 1 of it ever again . ) Way Way Out ( a Jerry Lewis movie that never resurfaced anywhere . It has Jerry and Dennis Weaver on a moon base I think . The film has really sexy girls , just think of the Matt Helm series as a reference . The local video shop has it for loan , but they don't advertise it . They act like it's some secret thing . )
56471689	3903056	Greatest Legs of ' 67	The scene of her saying goodbye to Redford at the elevator is mega sexy . She's portrayed as wearing NOTHING under his dress shirt . She's just standing out there letting everybody see her fabulous legs . If I were in the elevator , I'd be so turned on - - I'd better have a good excuse for missing work that morning . I could never pay attention to the story progress while all this aggressive sexuality is happening . I love that Cory is asking to be kissed literally every second that they're together . That's pretty intense . They're kissing so much that Paul's mouth has gone numb , actually it's gone past past being numb into another land of numbness . She still can't get enough of him in spite of six days with no break from each other . Instead of laughing at this , which of course was everyone's objective , I don't laugh ; I think about some other bodily function .

100722089	3903056	The Languages Part is Charming	Maybe I always like it when you have foreigners living and loving in a different country . Paris Je T'aime , Cabaret , and other films show people trying to understand and deal with language differences . I saw this film with both English and Spanish subtitles under the picture , which was a little much , but understanding the visual vocabulary . . . now that's something else . Besides the great tune from the White Stripes , there's nothing attractive here from the folks who may have liked Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , which is his grand contribution to narrative cinema .
25130898	3903056	Re : Not really a very violent Western	Well I'd say that most violent films are family films . In 1982 the Indiana Jones film was violent to such an extent that they created the PG-13 rating just to cover that one film . Maybe I have a lower tolerance for violence than the audience of today . In reference to his parents being killed : I can't think of a more violent description than McQueen verbally repeats twice during the film . I don't think someone would turn a camera and lights onto the scene he describes , ( even Michael Bay ) . His parents aren't just " killed " , they're tortured to death in the most sexual , racist , sadistic way that i've ever heard of . The mere sight of the death scene is enough to propel the entire film to its ( unsatisfying ) ending . I'm not one of these trolls or haters that competes with posters who adore the film . The film is fascinating to me and contains the finest acting talent of a generation in it . It gives me a gut-wrenching repulsion even to this day . It's not some dusty artifact for which I have some ironic distance .
28098299	3903056	The Scene where Betty Thomas shoots a perp . . .	then seems to faint after a spell .

But in syndication , all th good stuff , ( like the hot kisses ) get cut out for commercials .

I was a really small kid when my parents took me to a fancy Hollywood movie palace to see that show . I remember loving that first image of her singing the title song . It's one of the great movie openings of all time . Others would be Patton , and Goldiggers of 1933 , . . . to name two . Is there anybody who's a big Hollywood star now who can sing , act , dance and turn on the guys like she did , seeming effortlessly ? I can't think of one . Another film , Carnal Knowledge , she's quietly being Bobbi - - the hurt big hearted gal to Jack Nicholson's louse of a cad character . I remember that smearing mascara and hurt face of hers . Folks , that's really good stuff .
84014657	3903056	Subject of a Good Filmfax Article , August 2007	Basically he saw the film " Wings " then decided he'd work for Paramount . It was a few years until he got himself to Hollywood , then he made his wish come true by still working there . Is this the sort of thing you can still do ? I think not , but I'm a career pessimist . Imagine surviving the Mike Eisner / Barry Diller regime there ? Not everyone has the kind of people loving skills of his , it would be nice . But it shows how extraordinary you have to be . And look all the people he was older than : Michael Landon , Reagan , Elvis . . . they're all dead ! Life is indeed weirder than fiction .

19900310	3903056	' Damage Control , Report ! '	This is something that Crane must've said about 70 times during the show's run , and it stuck with me because I always used that phrase when " playing " as a kid . Did we ever see the Damage Control guys ? They couldn't have done their job well because the Seaview was nearly always being damaged . Irwin Allen had this weird fascination with equipment blowing up or " short-circuiting " . It was a feature in Lost in Space also , but in Voyage he created a near orgy of the stuff . Wasn't there an episode where the Seaview's bridge deck is being sparked by roman candle standards during the opening credit sequence along ? This was a side effect , in my non-scientific opinion , of early television's use of the extended fist-fight sequence . Readers must be aware that you never see extended fist fight orgies anymore on TV ? Could it be because those visual concepts have a trace of the sexual in them . . . hmmmm , I wonder ! Anything prolonged or extended like that - - the destruction of the enviornment by fighting or equipment self-destructing - - definitely communicates something orgiastic to audience members . Go ahead and tell me I'm wrong , but I've thought this way for years . Nevertheless , Allen's TV series are " Telefantasy " in the best way . They rely little on real life in making their points , and that form just isn't seen much these days .
14675136	3903056	Re : Gregg Araki fansite	I was lucky when in the early nineties , local LA channel KCET broadcast the entire " Three Bewhildered People . . . " and I taped it . His early movies are so good and so cheap that it's almost breathtaking . I consider my copy of this film as precious as my original issue zap comix . His other films are more general audience and peppered with standard violence cliches of our time - - this isn't the career arc I expected , but I still wish to run into him somewhere in LA , if only to see his other early films made before the nineties started .
24993084	3903056	Re : Where are Anne + Paula ?	I wish I knew where Anne Carlise is . I adore the character she created in Liquid Sky , and I don't mean " Jimmy " . Luckily I saw the last ten seconds of an appearance she did in Miami Vice , and it took me a decade to find out the show's title , which once " Vice " episodes came out by season on DVD , it's now possible to own the whole appearance . That show was called " Yankee Dollar " and involves her character with drugs , ( again ) . I bought her book and wrote her a fan letter . ( no response came ) I saw her in Perfect Strangers , a 1984 movie . It's a bore , but still it's her . I saw her quickie role in " Desperately Seeking Susan " I saw ten seconds of Miami Vice's " Yankee Dollar " and plan to own at least that episode someday .
51015116	3903056	Hey Dave	Ever make it to any VHS ' 74 reunions ? I remember seeing your undercranked super - 8 footage in high school and knew that you liked film a whole lot . I'm script supervising myself these days . See ya !
78340649	3903056	Gleeful Credits ?	People on this movie are putting their seemingly real names on this . I'm pretty sure I'd take the money and run - - it's better not to leave your traces behind on something like this .
102394918	3903056	Interesting Subject	This film is on the festival circuit right now , so I can't see it . However some people actually do live for the ultimate kiss . That is one of the reasons I currently live in Buenos Aires , Argentina . It is here that people kiss openly and endlessly all afternoon and in all age groups . I hope to participate soon in it , but so far the things I've seen could and would never occur in the United States even during the swinging sixties . So that is commitment to a concept all right .
61900471	3903056	Re : Watch the entire MST3K episode on YouTube !	Yes , thank you . I've done that already and can attest to the numbing effect on my body . This movie ought to be studied by science as it could be the next secret weapon .
57633128	3903056	Re : Did She Ever Have Her Own Stand-up Style ?	I posted that awhile ago , so I'll do my best . I first heard of Silverman and checked out her appearances , then later saw Leggero perform on talk shows - - they're of a similar height , weight , and vocal tone and both use material that clearly " clunks " at the end rythmically with either a startle effect or a longer , squishy , icky effect on young girls in the audience ; lets call it " more mature material " than simple observation humor . Other than that they have different first and last names , automobiles , boyfriends and blood type - - so ultimately yeah , they're two different people .

37456182	3903056	Re : VHS available , but haven't seen it	I know - - I haven't laid eyes on it since seeing it as a kid at a matinee - - can you believe ? There's probably a lot of adult content and references that went completely over my head at the time . So watching it again puts me as a kid in an adult body , or vice versa ; It's still neat any way you slice it .
18896859	3903056	Re : Liquid Sky Novel sheds some light	Oh , Man , those last few pages . Something I read over and over . It's difficult to leave an ending to your imagination for someone reading a narrative . The film did that well , but she needed something . She wants to use the aliens as metaphors for using , using people , using heroin , etc . It was Tzukerman who handled the aliens-in-New York subject . You're aware that he handled his alien invasion subject , while Carlisle cared more about the punks , fashion , clubs story line . As a collaberation , it was better than most IMO . She copped out with the novel , but . . . I already love her and the movie , so I retain my own ideas of Margaret's fate . I totally love Margaret and Adrian's relationship ; the way Margaret's voice goes sing-song , except when she's dissing some " scab " . God I love this film .
91017603	3903056	Re : Can someone explain the personal dynamics of the band	Thanks for that . Pete admitted to being somewhat gay , ( only he knows how gay he is ) , and I wonder if this is what caused some of the physical bashing . There is some incident where Roger was beaned by one of Pete's guitars followed by Pete's face being punched into the hospital by one of Roger's fists . But ya know . . . The Beatles had their share of punch ups as well that fans do not usually talk about but can be easily uncovered .
91017798	3903056	Re : Why does everyone diss him so ?	I understand that Pete complained to Rolling Stone about this very thing . That some of the fans went out of their way to disrespect the guy to his face , something you can't imagine happening to Jimi Hendrix , John Lennon , or Eric Clapton , eh ?

101881596	3903056	Fabulous Cinematography	I saw it tonight on a small television and the footage looks great . It must have been dazzling on the big screen . This is the kind of movie that eludes the ability of most other countries to pull off . Even though the film has an early nineties obsession with color saturations like David Lachapelle's work , it has a great style .
57861712	3903056	Re : Watch the MST3K episode on YouTube !	Literally and coincidentally I just finished watching the Youtube postings . It took a couple days before all 9 segs were loaded , but now it's all there . The film probably is partly gay-based to attract the entire audience available during that time . Yet you see both guys enjoying girls company throughout . Why is Bix chasing Carrie through the film if he's supposed to be gay ? The only one who's not confused by anything is the Jack Elam character , who's wonderfully creepy . The best compliment I have is this : around segment 7 , I resisted reading the IMdb comments because I wanted to know if Bix would simply leave town ( and Carrie ) behind . So , the plot started involving me in the story . . . and that IS the best thing I can say . Otherwise it requires much suspension of disbelief .
34853122	3903056	Ficitonal Version of Mayor of the Sunset Strip ?	I got this bite from Kim Fowley's website news . I'd really love it . I'm working as a Script Supervisor for hire in town , and I would volunteer for a project like that ! On the script , deciding what would be the story is the hardest part . The greatest Rock ' n Roll movie of all time , A Hard Day's Night , was an actual story / musical that really worked . Placed against HELP , which I consider just a collection of disconnected music videos , ( and who remembers the story of " Help " , anyone ? ) . The movie project would require the hit songs of the sixties to make it work - - so right there you know the project is doomed . . . . ah , now but wait . You still have a young attractive hustler named Kim Fowley who's out to make a name for himself regardless of who he has to sleep with , ( some guys have all the bad luck ) , and Rodney B , a fringe-dweller around the real scene . Here the " real scene " is the rise of the Sixties itself - - kids taking over essentially - - yet Rodney himself can't get started with anyone . Everyone he knows winds up mega-famous , with Rodney being their friend or groupie . As a consolation prize , Rodney gets between the sheets with lots of girls , he even dates a few , but does this collection of disconnected musical bits make a story ? Umm , well no . Not yet . Okay so more songs play in the background , " Hungry " by Paul Revere , " Secret Agent Man " by Johnny Rivers , songs by the Standells , Love , the Seeds , a dozen songs by the Monkees . . . You might see a Peter Fonda type doing research for THE TRIP . But still after all this , what's really important ? It's gotta be finding real love , getting respect from your parents , or finding out who you really are maybe ? Nah , see I'm already losing interest . No it's gotta be , bringing to birth all the female bands that both Kim and Rodney brought to light . At least thats the biopic / musical film that I want to Script Supervise for them . But even a film about dozens of girl bands being formed by guys in LA , even that needs a reason to be recreated - - even better a whole bunch of reasons . Okay so we follow Kim around doing his projects , then we follow Rodney around his ups and downs , ( remember that Hard Days Night followed the Beatles together as a group , then broke off during the middle to follow just Ringo's walk , George's trip listening to a mod-manufacturer , Paul attending his Grandfather , and John's . . . um John's thing . Then the film reunited them for the big musical show at the end . So I suggest reuniting Kim and Rodney when they both most need each other , and finding a breakthrough which they both can't exploit . Ha ha , and then reuniting them for a big musical climax . I'll leave that to the real writer , who's not me . Remember I'm just the guy holding the script between my legs who says to the director , " we're doing scene 69-E today : Rodney stops for gas for his ' 67 GTO and gets life changing advice from Frank Zappa at the Richfield Station . . . "
54223984	3903056	A Special Brand of Bad Film	While half-watching it , I experienced " plot vertigo " , explained as a sensation of forgetting any of the preceeding plot . It happened during the moment where the talking heads prattle on about radiation levels . . . up to the gigantic two - shot of the female scientist at screen left and male scientist at screen right who talk aimlessly at each other . You feel invited to a Thanksgiving dinner where you don't know the people talked about . About this film you could use the Woody Allen joke in paraphrase : " not much happening on screen , yes and filmed from so far away too . " You know it's bad when a camera mounted on a dog's collar or attached to a lawn sprinkler would yield more interesting results ; when surveillance cameras have more talent than the Director of Photography shows here - - you know you've seen a special brand of bad film . This film can incite an involuntary hallucinogenic state in the viewer just from the repeating dullness , and inconclusive staring at something offscreen - - the characters waiting hopelessly for something to happen coupled with our edgy indifference at participating in it . Not to forget the ugly photography , ear-confusing sounds acting as a musical score , and narrator from a radio Labor Day sales Ad Sweep . . . what you're left with is a new respect for films so jaw-droppingly bad that it defies your previous conceptions .
49397472	3903056	Mega Gorgeous	I helped her shoot an indy film recently and saw Jazsmin in action . She radiates success lemme tell ya . She wheels around town in her new Mercedes , negotiating deals on her cell phone . To be black and a young woman . . . man this is the American dream . I watched her kiss her co-star during the takes and got all turned on . She has great lips and really has the " sexy girl " thing nailed down . For those that care , she was on her mark with line readings - - a trait she probably learned in television , where few others in the scene were able to do . Good luck , Jaz

70650822	3903056	Re : Lots of Kissing in this Movie	Yes , those scenes make this a hot , worthwhile film . It's a sixties time capsule unintentionally as well . Yes it's facsinating .
43444263	3903056	Re : Lots of Kissing in this Movie	There's lots of kissing in this , and nobody will talk me out of it . . . but Brandon Tartikoff , the ex-NBC exec for programming the network , was a theater usher in 1967 . When the movie played in theaters he'd see it . He commented about that feature of the movie too . No , kissing is wonderful and it ' back , in fact . The word " makeout " has returned big time . Everyone knows what it means - - it still means the same thing it always did . My thread on " Grey's Anatomy " has won the most replies of any thread in months . It has the word " Makeout " in it - - which I deliberately used . Makeout is a fun word . If there's going to be a lot of uncontrolled sensuality onscreen , I don't want to see it unprepared with groups of people around me . But if anybody wants to send me their kissing photos , go ahead .

Food is just a small part , { watch Super Size Me } , of this whole business of Americans being bossed around , bullied , and belittled by forces " larger " than themselves . Now they're being impoverished by the second great depression and what are they saying about it ? They're willing to accept even that . No wonder the bullies keep doing it .
90134832	3903056	What a Dream Actor	For a director , Bob is wonderful . His brain remembers any line with minimum fuss and he gives any amount of colors to the material he's performing without any trace of that ownership - - where the actor won't or can't change or accept different colors on the lines . His face sells material written sarcastically but without any malice . Things just slide off Bob , and he's low maintenance and professional too . Love him !
54145125	3903056	Re : Quite possibly the worst moviemaker ever .	It's really the writing and bad camera angles and slow pacing . The directing is medium , but remember he's also on the camera too , and he frames things in fairly predictable ways - - all surprise is eliminated . He uses these head to toe full shots that simply frame people talking - - that's pretty boring even for 1988 . Everything is SLOW - - the security guard running is slow , the golf cart chase is slow , the van and private cars pulling into drive-ways move at a glacial , 1905 pace . It's bizarre . It stretches the audience trying to get worked up over a single puppet fighting with three people . By that time , you'd think the girls would try fighting them just for a little fun . Some fun continuity : Daphne has no sunglasses on until she steps outside to view kevin and the military guy fighting . Most people would take off sunglasses to watch a fight , but not her . The safe holding the creatures explodes at the top floor of a building . Was the safe underground ? Think so . The security guard is " fired " at night by an off camera scene , then hangs around long enough to blow up the creatures . After he's fired , why would he care at that point since they only kill studio people ? And there's no ending for the creatures : they simply stop terrorizing people and voluntarily re-enter the safe , where they're killed by a ton of explosives . So they're smart enough to drive a golf cart , but unaware of the explosives ?
56057391	3903056	Re : Sex Maniac ?	I don't think it's Roddenberry because he probably already had her successfully . She gravitated toward other people who became " profoundly intoxicated " just like she did . Remember that she was addicted to sex and booze , which became worse starting from her firing after only nine eps in the original series . Her co-workers would like to blame everything that occured upon this single man , but she must've allowed things to happen as well . She spent something like a decade and half being a booze-soaked sex slave after Star Trek . And that's pretty amazing stuff even for an actress . Anyone who follows this will mention the stats of Dana Plato - - who reportedly stayed drunk for a week at a time - - or " Father Knows Best " actress who fell into years of degradation and abuse by others . I find being addicted to sex an amusing thing ( it's probably painful , so I'm being insensitive ) , but now Roddenberry is dead , and Whitney is a sanctified straight-arrow . So none of it figures into anyone's sceme of things . But still . . . Star Trek is the primary experience of life for alot of us , so these are our meta-parents . Their behavior means things .

18007833	3903056	Re : Liquid Sky Novel sheds some light	Plotholes ? This whole effort was lucky just to make it into theaters and get a positive review from Roger Ebert . In fact , it was a " best of 1982 " program where I first heard about the film from Ebert . Later in the nineties sometime , I ran across Ebert checking out porn in " Circus of Books " in West Los Angeles , and though he didn't want anyone talking to him at that moment , I said , " thanks ya know , just thanks for mentioning Liquid Sky " . Later in the same book store I picked up the novel of Liquid sky . I wrote a fan letter to Carlisle , for which no response came . However the appreciation continues .
17507289	3903056	Re : How old is Nevada Smith ?	( ( CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS ) ) I see the movie occasionally and it always irritates some unknown part of me . First there's what you mention : this weirdness of him being a " kid " and then an Indian as well . In the scenes with Brian Keith , who's acting is terrific IMO , they look the same age . For some reason the violence seems over-the-top and gratuitous . Every few minutes someones getting cut , blasted , burned , dragged , punched . . . it seems endless . The same director did " True Grit " in 1970 but for some reason all the violence there seems just about right . I saw this film as a kid , and it disturbed me then . Even as an adult it's hard to swallow . Those descriptions of his mom and dad being killed are almost pornographic in detail . Man , it's creepy . McQueen seems distant and lifeless in this character for some reason . In the Great Escape he came off as heroic , same also in the Sand Pebbles , but here he accomplishes his goal , but with a twist of character that doesn't work artistically . The end is sort of a dead end in spite of letting the bad guy live . You're supposed to believe and to like the guy , Nevada Smith , and what he's doing . But how can you really root for him when he's being as despicable as the worst bad guy shown ? In spite of all this i still watch Nevada Smith for it's arch performances and sincerity .

85826721	3903056	Byron Haskin's Possible Effects	Jack Warner employed one of the great Sci-fi directors of all time , to do effects ? Anyway . . . the scene where Elaine and Mortimer are playing hide and seek in the yard with Brooklyn in the background , that may be my candidate for an effects shot that mixes live action and plates . Obviously they didn't send a second unit to shoot things in Brooklyn when Burbank was outside . The baseball game at the beginning was stock footage and live action cut together . However that shot of them against a night backdrop of moving activity , that's my vote .
70876466	3903056	Re : Man , I LOVE this film !	Recently his next film appeared in the trade publications . It was shooting in the old Soviet Union .

Notwithstanding Tarrantino , this is a film I didn't need him for . Actually I saw it because of Roger Ebert's glowing review and its write up in American Cinematographer magazine .

Copying his tape is a low priority therefore . Seeing it is essential though . The film is a work of low budget genius ; even the small accidents in making the film , like out of sync dialogue and cranking speed problems . . . even these things work for the film's advantage . My current roomate has worked as a crew member on dozens of features including Jawbreaker , and even he would like to just meet Araki once . I could copy it if things improve me . I'll check back from month to month . I write copiously on this site .

56806636	3903056	Re : Top 10 Best Screenwriters	I listened to Goldman talk last night at EXPO 5 in Los Angeles . He reiterates most of what you say . I can easily see how his actual , honest frustrations with the system can be interpreted as cynical shots toward the powerful . It's bravery personified to just keep writing against the backdrop of constant scruitiny and rejection . His biggest successes happened in the mid-seventies because studio's were in disarray and uncertain . He was brave at a time that demanded and rewarded bravery . Unfortunately , the audience doesn't support ( largely ) edgy , dangerous subject matter . Courageous writing now happens on television according to him , thus unergirding his comment was " Since when did TV get good ? " Those words like " hack " are convenient and make the user seem smart and informed . However life is more complex than simple , unchanging definitions for a man's entire output . the writer's plight " you have to prove over and over with every job that you have talent . . . to employers with none .

73135643	3903056	Re : Joan Jett . . . . . why , why ? ! ? !	Neon Angels is a better title than " Mama Weer All Crazee now " , that's for sure .

That weekend would be an education in late seventies rock for kids these days .
14176044	3903056	My Fave Outer Limits of all time by Lawrence	He wrote " the Man who was never born " for the show in ' 63 .

I wrote this about him right after seeing " Mayor of the Sunset Strip " , and thought that there ought to be a Kim Fowley / Runaways movie someday , and if there wasn't then I would write a piece about him . But I was wrong , and now there is at least a " sign post up ahead " film about the whole , fervid scene back in 1975 of transgendered music making - - but i have always just preferred girl bands with real girls in them . So now lots of people should be interested in how a svengali got an unlikely band started . Once it's released in April , the film may inspire modern teens to get involved in ways Kim would approve of .
65406587	3903056	Re : Black the Ripper	An addendum to my answer : My referenced teacher's name is Jim Kelly Durgin , who teaches production management techniques in Van Nuys , California . His career as script supervisor and production manager crossed many paths in the Late sixties and seventies . You can find IMdb references to Frank on films like " Cain's Cuttroats " , which coincidentally featured Ed Wood's girlfriend Valda Hansen , a film which had Frank acting during the year 1971 ! Ted Mikels , worthy of his own book , worked with Saletri on Blacula as an assistant director of all things . Earlier , Mikels gained fame by distributing " the Undertaker and his Pals " which Jim Durgin associate produced and was production manager , ( he hired all the crew ) . Later on Valda Hansen became Jim Durgin's girlfriend for eight years . Many of these original Hollywood outlaws still live in the city environs doing their specialty .

You'd expect that Kevin being new , that the old man guard would go more places by himself . Nobody ever went into any kind of break room . Nobody told a bad joke about the studio . " They're attracted to bright light " so why are they first found in a vault , climb into a van at night , hide behind seats . Why doesn't the old guard feel any remorse for letting them hang around for thirty years ? Shouldn't he be killing himself rather than the creatures ?
161543570	3903056	Re : Face it , the hippie chicks have pants . . .	Some video benefactor sent me the movie on disc awhile back , and I watched it , but saw no crotch grabbing pants at all .

There was a Sixties version of this same idea , that I don't have any obsession about at all - - Hot Rods To Hell - - which I actually saw in 35mm in a theater during its release . Mimsy Farmer is in it , but heck if I remember anything about it .

161054679	3903056	Re : Some Bad Career Choices	Well I think too that she is special and unique . For example , she could have easily played the part in " Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe ? " ( 1966 ) , which is your classic , Oscar-worthy movie with stars and star Director attached - - Sandy Dennis played the role - - but then that is another of the type of neurotic , half crazy female that was in vogue then . Weld may have been worried that Hollywood would simply typecast her forever as that nervous , edgy female , and it certainly was capable of doing that . So without knowing why she chose off beat roles , that reason coulda been a contender , if you know what I mean . No I didn't see her up against DeNiro , but that is evidence that she could have been opposite lots of quality actors in their day , Taylor , Burton , etc .

28144287	3903056	Blew my chance to meet Ib Melchoir and Steve . . .	A couple years ago here in Los Angeles , there was a showing of " The Time Travellers " at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood attended by the director and Steve Franken , one of the actors . I had very little moola at the time so passed on it . I regret it because my money situation never did improve , so I'd have been no farther behind if i'd gone ! This film was intensely creative , although as a kid I never understood the ending . ( so , they got back to their own time , right ? or not ? ) That rocket on the launch pad was very nice and the telescreen effect was really boss , to use a 1963 expression . The director was involved with my favorite Outer Limits episode , and is widely credited with the original idea for the TV series Lost in Space - - another favorite of my kid side . Just to stand there and thank him personally for making my childhood more wonderful . . . that would be a nice 40-year thank you , but delivered while the principles of the film are still alive . There may never be another chance to see Melchoir , who knows ?
25422865	3903056	Re : Gregg Araki fansite	I'd say that Araki doesn't make movies like this anymore , and nobody is like Araki so the film is truly unique . What's inspirational about the film is that it clocks in a tad over 90 minutes , completely involves you in the characters and their situations , yet is literally " edited on the kitchen table " in Araki's words . It looks far worse in quality than Araki's French Director heroes projects , yet the talent behind the whole thing just shines through . That's why it's so inspirational to me even though I have never planned a feature film project .

90311796	3903056	How's Life in Florida , Bub ?	Ron , all of us here in Cinema Arts Tech are hoping you have a great time in Haiti and South Florida for the picture shooting there . We wish fun , good times , and more spending cash for all of us who make the Directors in film look good .
56564517	3903056	Cats are as Close as Earth	It just seems that the moon people who have the power to freeze North America from the moon , ( without making any appearances at all ) , would be so enamoured of cats . You'd think they'd be able to steal at least a few without bothering anyone . All you need is a few cats , and before you know it you have a few more . . . The moon people are enamoured with amor , as we all are , but can read our primive minds anyway , so wouldn't the physical follow-through be a little redundant for them ? The moon people also possess a kind of moral intolerance - - they'll kill us in response to us being so evil and aggressive . The proximity of the Earth's Nobel Peace winners had no effect on their thinking . . well too bad .
111711263	3903056	Re : Movie About The Cuckoo's Nest ?	How great for those involved . I'm sure Jerry Roach thinks that the film should just be about his struggle with police , cities and actual bands during that time , but the Producers must deal with him , haha . Recently a film was completed and debuted about Darby Crash's life directed by George Hickenlooper , so it looks like all the kids born in the sixties are going through their heavy nostalgia phase . Well good luck to ya !
40581663	3903056	Re : Fight Scene , man . . . Tuesday Weld , drunkeness	Well . . . I liked Gleason alot in " The Hustler " , while lots of others enjoyed him being very over-the-top in " Smokey and the Bandit " . Not to argue , but does Gleason and McQueen have chemistry onscreen together ? I don't think so . This film as a bit of " maximum ickyness " between the frames , as in : the film is " icky " . There are a lot of unexplained things happening that allow your mind to fill in the gaps . The McQueen character seems nearly moronic - - he has a goal that can't be fulfilled , and everybody but him seems to know that . Maxwell Slaughter seems to be slumming with people beneath his intelligence and appears to not get anything out of it . If this was X-rated , you'd have a Russ Meyer film of sorts . The women in the picture seem half-realized , as if they're not past the age of eight . The film's world is oddly tilted . One thing it does have is a mood that stays consistent , which is likely helped by its being in good ol ' black and white . As a kid seeing it , I liked most the Gleason character . He's on top of things , has what he wants , and look : he doesn't even sweat while everyone else is wilting all around him . McQueen is just helplessly floundering around with this and that next big project that ultimately fizzles out . It reminds me of one-act stage plays of the fifties that flirted with " realism " of the time . Anyway . . . McQueen also starred a few years later in " Nevada Smith " , another film with incredibly out-of-proportion violence and maximum ickyness happening inside its frames . I liked McQueen in the Sand Pebbles , Bullit , and The Great Escape . He was the Harrison Ford of the Fifties and Sixties , but played the anti-hero a lot more than guys do these days .
34848575	3903056	Wasn't he born in 1940 ?	and not in 1942 ? Grew up with Hollywood royalty actor father , Doug Fowley , but Kim must've felt some sort of resentment mixed with " don't they understand what a geunius I am ? " mentality . At some time , Kim developed a serious need to talk and / or act out everything concerning the big boom-boom . I think he's an unrepentent sexual addict , which he's relied for subjects of his songs , poetry , and band formation . I'd suspect that by the time he left his parents behind , around 1959-60 , he'd already shagged more holes than Austin Powers has boasts about . Now that he's over 60 years old , he still has a thing for man to woman sex , man to man sex , man to tran sex , woman to woman . . . alright you must get the point . Songs , singing , and performing came naturally to Kim , as did forming groups of other people . People just don't realize how many bands this guy has put together . Where Carole King will forever be remembered for the sheer number of hit songs for other artists , Kim should be known , ( in a perfect world ) , for the sheer number of rock ' n roll bands he assembled . Now these bands may only be concepts - - he represented a female wrestler / singer called " Cobra " or the all-drag , lypsynch band " The Cosmetics " and a concept called " The New Runaways " comprised of a motley collection of straight and dyky females who actually made a record under Kim's hypnotic spell - - but these were in addition to the serious bands he formed that most people never heard of also ! He got some " serious " work for artists like KISS , Helen Reddy , Liza Minnelli , and others , ( his biggest payday was having two million selling songs - - Ally Oop , and " Popcicles , Icicles " by the Murmaids ) but mainly he scored in the 1975-1980 period by putting together the beginnings of a career for Lita Ford and Joan Jett by his bankrolling / producing of the wonderful all-girl band , The Runaways . Prior to being seen in the Rodney Bingenheimer bio-documentary , Mayor of the Sunset Strip " , where he appears as a 60 year old , genteel actor of the nineteen-fourties chatting about the sexual life of he and Rodney on LA's Sunset Strip of 1967 , Kim was out of sight for about a decade setting up shop in various US cities - - mainly New Orleans - - for the bands , for the sex , for the anonymity . What's interesting about Kim is that he's been up with the highest , say John and Yoko in Toronto , and down with the lowest : checking out some unknown , lesbian poet in an LA dive on a Wednesday night at 2 : 30am - - yet maintains his Rock ' n Roll street cred . He's the typical guy who literally would say , " Hey baby I can make you a star " , something which he can literally accomplish . The target of such a line might say , " Mister , that's the corniest line I ever heard " . Kim would know this as well , but he's cheeky enough to not give a damn about what anyone thinks . Attention must be paid to such a man .
138646197	3903056	Re : list of movies mentioned ?	Thanks for the list . I wish the filmmakers had listed titles that came from this period , and aren't too hard to find if you look . This list would include GAS , or it became necessary to destroy the world in order to save it Vanishing Point The Revolutionary Valdez is Coming Little Big Man Slapshot Smile Pink Flamingos
163850340	3903056	Re : lookalike	Don Gordon was in my 2nd favorite , original Outer Limits episode about a group of strangers who get transported to space via a rocket ship carnival ride , actually an alien spaceship , for which Don was the pilot . Actually the story has Don being a " blind " to everyone as well , because he was a runaway , nuclear physicist who drops out when asked to build ever greater bombs , and the alien uses his intelligence to convince the strangers that they should all make this long journey together . My first favorite Outer Limits ep is " The Man Who Was Never Born " , the Terminator style time travel piece about saving the world . Always get Don Gordon confused with Don Stroud , " The Buddy Holly Story " even though my brain knows better .
160083564	3903056	Re : Wasn't he born in 1940 ?	Hey , thanks for the extra info . Yes the film has the March 19 release , which happens to be the same date that my fav film of the 2000's so far , " Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind " opened . I would suspect that with two movie stars in the lead roles , the film would earn back its budget , but could be wrong about that . At least the film makers took the book and tried to make something like it , that is Neon Angel . Seeing a really good film at the size and sound level it was intended for makes a big difference . Can you imagine people lining up to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show without the 35mm projection and multi speaker sound ? When I saw the film Woodstock , the 1969 version , it was always in a theater , and they never charged much . I mean you do want to hear The Who and Hendrix pretty loud if you can . More later I'm sure ,
69791393	3903056	Wouldn't a Cute Porn Version Be . . .	Since we no longer " pan to the window " when couples start kissing , I'd love to be involved in a project where we film just what Cory and Paul did for those six days without leaving the room . I'd bet she walked around in his dress shirt , and I think she'd be kissing him alot . Even the future head of NBC network , Brandon Tartikoff , said to an interviewer , " there IS a lot of kissing in this movie " . He was a theater usher at a New York cinema in 1967 . Since there's this current theme of revisioning ' everything's gay ' in entertainment , like Dr . Smith from 1965's Lost in Space as a gay , child molester , the Skipper and Gilligan were gay , etc . . . perhaps Cory could be called an " untreated nypmphomaniac " and is using Paul's lips to self medicate !
100354251	3903056	Highly Enjoyable	As someone mentioned , this film opens more doors than closes them , which is the definition of words and syntax itself . If life was only a series of mysteries waiting for solutions , then all we need is language . Nope , fictions exist because we need those abstractions for a stage - - a stage in which to face realities . And to paraphrase Director Mike Nichols , " if we could have just told you this story using words , we would have . " Now then , like a Chinese box , if those abstractions are crucial to understanding reality , then there is no separate reality . Ah ha , now I understand ! The film bears watching at least twice , and one can ignore the host's continuted references to Freud . Is anyone going to read those works in order to fact-check any statements ? Isn't there a point made about the power of forms themselves ? That point was : once the viewer's attention is engaged , then it does not matter if the artifice is now shown , because the viewer allows himself the pleasure of the deception anyway . Likewise In spite of the film's pretentions to concepts larger than cinema itself , it still succeeds as a damn good entertainment .
102693549	3903056	Re : Enjoyed this at the Cinema	Nope . . . well I know a young asian guy who works the finance and distribution office for Paramount , but he doesn't have the interest in seeing the film released . well , just saying that to meet a crew member of the film who happens to be in great mental and physical shape these days , He entirely runs LA Film School's Administration ; that is a joy . Good luck on finding it . PS : you may get copies from people who videotaped it while on TV in another country . Of course who that might be , no one knows . Someone sent me a copy of a Susan Dey TV film from 1973 because I simply asked so many people on message boards of its existence until the right guy read the postings .
118012919	3903056	I Remember the Sept 9 1967 Pilot Special	It was an amazing experience to watch . For videotape editing , they must have spent untold hours with it because it moved faster than anything on film . Those editing machines in those days were SLOW and large , cumbersome beasts . These days a college kid can edit a sequence will sipping cappuccino in a cafe using a laptop loaded with Final Cut Pro . It seemed everyone in comedy was on that show , similar to It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World . Later when Laugh in went to regular air times , it had the sexiest girls as well as funny , Benny Hill type stuff . What a great show .
31037518	3903056	Re : How old is Nevada Smith ?	For others reading this thread : I'm taking apart the film in places for a couple reasons . It has the late Sixties nihilism that crept into narrative films that I remember as a kid and resented . Nihilism here means that the hero may not be a hero after all-but life's tough so accept it . But the film really just flirts with it , not consummating it . ( my spelling may be rough in places ) . The violence in the film departs from the more entertaining violence , ( the knocking down henchmen stuff , like playing with toy soldiers ) say that is depticted in " The Magnificent Seven " , also a McQueen movie BTW . That's the typical popcorn munching , crowd rousing stuff . Nevada Smith has a more malevalent violence happening that borders on S & M , and I guess that type of stuff bothers me more . The film still is fascinating , and I always find myself staying with it at whatever point I see it . Brian Keith's performance is nuanced just perfectly . He's a joy in the piece . The film got backing from the AIP independents like Joe Levine , meaning that they were encouraged to depart from censor and studio standards ; I'm sure the director and writer just loved the idea of this , but there's ten year old kids watching this in 1966 . . .
144120067	3903056	Julie , this movie got listed as your first job !	Howdy , I worked on this show with you too , and I should get some credit for the four out of eleven days they shot this ! Looking back it was a very creatively shot show , especially if you think that this is Nick's first job doing all the main facets of filmmaking . Nick is a director that I would recommend if asked . So . . got my picture taken with Christopher lloyd , which wasn't a bad outcome , I just wish the worst luck for the Producer , Begonia . In future , I hope she treats people better . Bill
38190090	3903056	Re : VHS available , but haven't seen it	We have VHS ! So I rented it last night - - first laid eyes on this gem back in ' 66 when I was ten years old . Ten year olds shouldn't see movies like this , hehe . Jerry Lewis does less of his wacky character here , and tries playing it straight , not for gonzo laughs . He's nearly laid back compared to Robert Morley's curtain rattling performance as Jerry and Connie Stevens " first married couple on the moon . He's a handler like Leo G . Carroll was for Napoleon Solo in the Man From Uncle . Brian Keith appears several times in short inserts as a gruff-but-still-gruffer General who orders third act action where Jerry must " secure the moon " . Sure , all the sets are drenched in futuristic lighting as the story is set sometime after the Sixties , doesn't say when though . So in the background are cool concept cars of the future , during the Earth based scenes . You see solid patches of red and brilliant white furniture , ( and very cool clear , plastic pillows ) , straight outta movies like " In Like Flint " or the British set designer for Sixties movies Ken Adam . The Moon base location has cool looking pods for sleeping / working - - and yes the patented " Batman " - style , big , blinking lights computers are strewn all over your eyeline , which I totally loved as a kid . Lighting-wise , the production simply pours all available light at all times during the indoor moon scenes , which has a television-feel about it ; later verified by the technical names , especially Jack Martin Smith , who worked scores of sci-fi / fantasy pics during the Sixties for TV and low budget independents . The film is super-sexy with tease galore supplied by Anita Ekberg's fab legs , shot from at least three anges during her opening house call on the American Married couple living next door on the moon . There's all sort of adult-level innuendo that flew over my head at the time : things about wife swapping , watching two girls makeout on one's wedding night , and others that are cleverly enfolded into the dialog , some PC types of the Two-Thousands would call this " leering " and it probably is , hehe . Dick Shawn as the Tarzan-like Russian counterpart to Jerry simply does his patented " thing " with grimacing and good accents . There's an extended sequence of everybody getting drunk and kinda swapping , which today's producers would be cutting out because bad things happen to people who drink to excess , right ? - - oh yeah everybody knows that . The drunk thing was big in the sixties for some reason . Dick Shawn's other picture that year " What Did You Do In The War , Daddy ? " had him being drunk through days of story time . Seeing this movie without any warning would certainly remind some of Austin Powers , it's inescapable really . However I saw this tonight with a 28 year old who reminded me , " Austin Powers got it's look from this not the other way around "
40463401	3903056	Re : Fight Scene , man . . . Tuesday Weld , drunkeness	No that was arranged to make you think so . Having the great one lift and throw someone like . . . " Maxwell " did that , Gleason was helped by the coordinators . Of course Maxwell then falls asleep during the fight , which took me awhile to understand . Slowly I'm getting used to the movie . : )
154137987	3903056	Re : How could they make it better ? ?	The LIS movie captured the essence of being a family in Space , no matter how goofy that concept is , the heart was there . Likewise , the Sixties TV show had that mix of " the future " along with that Campbell's Soup feeling of security that your dad and mom are always there no matter what happens . Irwin Allen's awful , dreadful special effects were balanced by snappy writing and fantastic ( John Williams ) music scores . Even Allen couldn't top himself , so it's doubtful that anyone can , except maybe the King , ( James Cameron ) . The psychology of being away from the Earth , mainly the possibility of going crazy totally , should be explored more , and will we have a technology to deal with that , like maybe a simulated Earth experience wherever you happen to be in the galaxy ?
120941916	3903056	Liked it , but Who Ever Saw This ?	Hi , I used to be a script supervisor who worked on shorts and webisodes , so I know the quality level is high here . Does the producer intend for this to just play on You Tube , or are they sending it overseas or the DVD market ? Now in 2008 , the anti-government feelings are starting to really swell . It seems like this crew got the right movie .
120446883	3903056	Re : Saw it in 1974 in the Theater	At the time , I didn't because Meyer didn't understand anything about this subject . His concept of a girlband was square even for that time , their music sucks and is obviously coming from a singer off screen . The narrative seems to pick many styles instead of centering on any one thing . That said , once the dust clears and you see it again , you see how it yanks you into its world fairly well and tries to dominate your senses . It now is like a touchstone for that kind of hyper style that I see in Anna Biller , especially her film " VIVA " . Lots of my friends have multiple copies of Meyer's film and presumably get a lot of entertainment in some form from it .
154694653	3903056	Re : Prick	I thought " primitive " was the point with South Park , what else were they trying to do with the art ? These shows are all very funny though , and for that the art doesn't need to be perfect . Rocky and Bullwinkle . . . man the art barely moves at all - - it happens to be about the groany gags and timing . Ren and Stimpy is hilarious too , but his later remixes of all that genre got tedious , like a joke being told too many times . John's " pretty girls " look exactly the same , sorry John . . .
164210948	3903056	Re : runaways ?	Back in the VHS video days of the eighties I rented Dubeateo , which was a Joan knock piece . She hated those producers because they used footage from Mama Weer All Crazee Now . That film wasn't completed but several people have told of the usual casting call for extras by the production . So it was the usual Hollywood fire drill of a movie , whatever they had . Rainbeaux ( Cheryl ) Smith portraying one of the Runaways in the film , and she got to play once with Joan for a show they did after the band broke up . Back in ' 78 you could actually hang out with Joan and the others , and this was pretty hard during the Runaways career , mainly cuz the band was a secretive Fowley project in 1975 , and by the time of their signing , they were a very serious band traveling the world . But things were falling apart in the late seventies , and Joan would actually speak to you , rather than grunt , I understand .
146414247	3903056	Shooting Now in Buenos Aires , Beautiful	Yesterday the Production used the entire Ave De Mayo street , closest to Plaza De Mayo here in Buenos Aires , for filming . All sorts of great looking 1920's cars were there on the street . All the extras were being fed at the local outdoor restaurants nearby . Even though Spring is here , still it is pretty warm outside at night . The extras are dressed in great twenties clothes . . . hats , double brested suits , veils and hats for the women , kids wearing those floppy Irish hats and suspenders . No big stars seemed destined for this show , but the location looks pretty good .
164850389	3903056	Re : Does Anyone Remember Gilda's SNL ' Firing ' ?	I remember her starting to talk to the audience and is interrupted by the offstage voice of Lorne Michaels , who is trying to say that she's fired , but obviously it didn't happen that night . . . I would sure love to see it again . The last time i saw it was the seventies , the late seventies , which is quite awhile ago nowadays .
114594093	3903056	Re : This guy has no talent ( the Questions post )	In the case of the Aviator , I mean C'mon , how hard is it to write a Noah Deitrich character ? Doesn't anyone remember the fantastic mini-series , The Amazing Howard Hughes " with Tommy Lee Jones in the role ? The lines are simply facsimilies of work already accomplished . How much imagination does it take to replicate a plane crash ( the 1946 one in Beverly Hills ) that actually happened ? They're aren't deviating one iota from what actually happened , aka : the historical record . Can't someone in the audience simply open up Wikipedia and start typing for the same result ? Couldn't any director have shot this script ? Would Joel Schumacher or Richard Donner's version of this script be unwatchable for some reason ?
114317360	3903056	Re : Best girl / girl kiss ! ! !	The film has all sorts of good french kisses in it as does only another of Meyer's films . The one I'm thinking of has a cop frenching this blond , mini-skirted babe in the back seat of a Camero ( small , small seat ) and he almost devours her face with the kiss ; a super turn-on .
57979784	3903056	Re : Best Movie ?	I've seen " Three Bewhildered People . . " and it has no violence at all . It's just three friends trying to relate on no money in Los Angeles . There are long scenes of just smoking and talking . It's similar to French films where people say to each other , " But why do we have to love ? " and then listen for the answer . On top of that it's so low budget that you're constantly amazed that it works as a film at all . He shot in black and white super 8mm , with no recorded sound . All the actors dialogue was dubbed in once he fully edited the picture part . So you have this primitive image , shot in bright light at night around recognizable places like West L . A . Tower Records or anonymous gas stations , and then this is combined with a well-recorded dialogue track that is always just a little out of sync with the picture . But this had a charming effect on my nervous system anyway . I fell in love with it and by association with Araki's nerve and unified vision . He's like a novelist working in film . Whatever he does good or bad , it's still him .
110428718	3903056	Weird Kissing Scene in This ?	One of the WW-2 Fleet movies , I think it's this one , the cute girl has one sailer sitting next to her and another laying his head on her lap . The camera catches her as her lips are pulling off of one guy , then she turns without thinking and kisses the guy's head on her lap . Jeez , that's pretty racy for 1942 , but it's charming to realize that the population was doing everything possible to win the war .
156735758	3903056	Some Bad Career Choices	Although she was the best thing in " Waiting For Mr . Goodbar " , and got an Oscar nomination , she has been in some real turkeys and stinkers . I just saw " Lord Love A Duck " from 1965 , and my question is why accept a role like this destined for the trash bin of culture ? Also she got buried in Pretty Poison and the simply awful " Soldier in the Rain " , which after an hour of it , you wish it would rain in the theater so you'd have an excuse to leave . Maybe she was much more effective on TV , who knows . But yeah , I agree with posters here , that like some other actresses who had beauty and talent , Gloria Graham comes to mind , Weld just wasn't destined to be first on anyone's movie list .
28097792	3903056	Does Anyone Remember Gilda's SNL ' Firing ' ?	I've not seen this particular teaser since the seventies , but I swear one Saturday night Gilda appears solo , stands around listening to Lorne's offstage voice telling her , " ah , Gilda ? we won't need you " and she answers , " what just for the opening , right ? " " Ah , no in fact your fired . " She looks sad and depressed and begins to wander off the stage . " don't you have something to say before leaving ? " and she recovers , and says " Oh yeah - - Live from New York It's Saturday Night " with the biggest smile . I just loved how they did that , but I've never seen it since . Anyone remember something happening remotely like that ?
61898755	3903056	Re : I * LOVE * This Movie !	Yup , I saw it originally during it's broadcast in ' 78 . I loved the female drummer in Charlie Martin Smith's band - - she was real cute , kinda like Brittany Murphy in Clueless . They're supposed to be a group of fringy losers who form a band and gain acceptance finally from the all the hot high school folks . There's a battle of the bands with a typically lousy hard rock ( all-guy band ) band . Probably if " Cotton Candy " had followed a popular teen flick from ' 82 of which we all know the title , then it would've hit bigger . I haven't seen a frame of it since then , but would love to compare mental notes with my earlier enthusiastic self .
101881835	3903056	Re : If you think Swordfish has any Versimilitude	Good points . The movie is " fanciful " . Realistic it isn't . One thing about the hero caring for his daughter so much . . . why would be hack at all if he had a family ? It's more adult if the Hugh Jackman character faces off against Travolta's organization just for the balls of it , not for any pussy reason like needing to pay legal fees . Do hacker's pay all their bills . . . does anybody these days ? Having the daughter involved is clearly a " movie reason " to do something . Still with all that , the film is good , popcorn eating entertainment .
69843990	3903056	Born in the Same Year	. . . year as my dad , but obviously didn't make it to the nineties or the two-thousands . Like many " GI generation " guys like Rod Serling , Gene Roddenberry , wrote , adapted , re-wrote , or outright stole most of the great stories we boomers grew up with . The Rifleman , Lost in Space . . . these were all morality stories that I just assumed everyone knew and took for granted . These guys got paid fantastic money and lived in nice places in LA and the Valley , but still - - thanks anyway !
77751688	3903056	Good Job	I kept wondering where I've seen you before during " Stranger Than Fiction " which is a sign of being a star . You should've had the Queen Latifah role . Good luck in future to you .

140761519	3903056	Finally Saw the Film in Argentina	I worked on the film , and got fired after a week , but never did see the final assembly or what Brett was trying to do at all . Once here in Argentina ( where Coppola shot his latest film ) , my house host for the night had a copy stolen off of Limewire , and I finally got to see it . It really does hit a few notes of wistful , light comedy that I have not seen accomplished elsewhere . So , good job , Brett . I don't have any regrets about being fired . Everything happens the way it should .

128853678	3903056	Re : The ' Abby Singer . . . '	Singer got pretty high in the corporate world , MTM I think , when it was on the CBS lot in Studio City , this was after he'd spent years being a First Assistant Director on shows like Gunsmoke . I had lunch at LA Film School with someone who worked with him on a show , and then I found out that he donates his time to AFI students who can get meetings with him about various subjects . Thankfully nowadays , when the Assistant calls out " Abbey Singer " it really means second to the last shot . So there is progress in life .
117195662	3903056	Re : The Masters of Cinematography	Gordon Willis's last movie for Woody Allen , Stardust Memories , also acheives amazing gradations of temperature ( the best word I can think of ) during his late dusk sequences shot for the exteriors - - I'm thinking of the balloons floating in the late afternoon . You get the feeling of watching art literally ruffle like a flag before your eyes . Like the best of 40's cinematography , it gives off warm , toasty vibes . Sorry to be so Hippie in my descriptions .
128942931	3903056	Saw this in Theater , was the Perfect Age for it	Yep I saw the film in its first release , ( saw the actual clattery 35 millimeter print - - no half assed , digital crap ) , and it was my first sight of both Robbie Benson and O'Conner . There was a real attempt by producers to make these two the " couple " of our generation , say like what the early 1940's were for Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney . There are few guys at the time who wouldn't say that O'Conner was sexy and sweet . Benson . . hmmm , I don't know . He had a really nice voice , but both actors did schlocky stuff later on that never lived up to this first , tender direction that they were heading .
114318223	3903056	Saw it in 1974 in the Theater	And the very first scene playing was Ashley's orgasm inside the Rolls Royce ; something in my head kept asking , what kind of movie is this , but I stayed to the bitter end . The photography is simply gorgeous , and I wish all films looked like this . Cinema being the true pervert art it is , the photography is also fetish , like its Director . Meyer cut his films to look frenetic and out of joint as a regular style during the colorful Sixties . Probably it worked here to make people believe the picture had a budget of millions and army of technicians working on it . But yes , it can't be a " serious " picture , especially when you hear the airplane crashing sound when the dude drops out of the rafters onto the stage at the near-end of BVD . Never did I once think it would last this long and become people's favorite bad movie . I would reserve that " The Eye Creatures " or " Cat-women of the Moon " .
79519826	3903056	Re : Wouldn't a Cute Porn Version Be . . .	She adored making out with him , especially in Central Park and other New York places . Can you imagine being a mutual friend of theirs during their courtship ? You'd be constantly looking at them making it in public , eeewww . . . now privately with my camera ready , that's a different matter .
40065939	3903056	Re : Fight Scene , man . . . Tuesday Weld , drunkeness	Thanks for commenting . It's an extremely personally violent experience . I think having a fight like that would literally change your life . Most fights don't bother me , but that one does for some odd reason .
101883144	3903056	Just read about the Continuity Mistakes in Swordfish	Yes , and those mistakes are Trudy's fault , but did that stop her ? She's working for Speilberg on Indy 4 , so apparently script supervisors don't have to be absolutely perfect . Script supervising is the hardest job in movies that has to be done anyway , regardless of the boo boos . So a boom mic was reflected in the bathroom mirror , shouldn't the DP have caught that too ? Travolta's facial hair missing , the changing cigarette lengths , and the non-continuous dents and dings in the FBI car - - yes that's her department . But if she can be forgiven , lets just all get a good night's rest after the shoot .

102256543	3903056	Film has the Same Kind of Comfortable Message ( Spoiler Alert )	That the James Bond films have and many other cold war-era films , the time which I grew up . It is that even though bad guys roam freely and cause untenable situations , the efforts of a few people ( and their ultimate sacrifices ) will turn the tide and restore our way of life . They call this a propaganda film , but rather more a fantasy using modern reference points . It is a comfortable message , one that reminds me so much of watching films by myself on Saturdays around aged 11 or so .

54147500	3903056	Re : Hobgoblins as an Excercise in film Silliness	Kari French has always been a dancer / exhibitionist for hire here in Los Angeles ( she was Pixie ) . That scene where she falls to the floor for a sex bout with the MC is right out of a John Waters film . Why is she dancing a sixties style go-go dance during the late eighties ? Why is almost nobody occupying Club Scum ? ( AKA : the Music Machine , the great West LA music club ) Aren't those scenes where Kevin sees Amy dancing on stage . . . aren't those lifted from a similar scene in Desperatly Seeking Susan ( 1985 ) , where Rosanna Arquette believes that she's living out the fantasy of being " Susan " , and her husband keeps trying to get onstage to stop her from dancing ?
100732994	3903056	Probably Shot in 2005 , but What About 2008 ?	Now that people are seriously feeling a contracting economy , does the average American simply stay at the same level of debt or just refuse to pay ? The ultimate joke is that the credit extending companies won't ever go broke , like say you and me might do . Because there are so few banks extending credit , the US Government must bail them out if we all default on these bad load terms .
109863399	3903056	Re : Seen in cinerama	My parents took me to see the movie during it's play in Los Angeles during the early sixties , which shows what good parents they were - - willing to pay top dollar for a film show . They also took me to the Brothers Grimm film made in the same process . I haven't seen a frame of " How the West Was Won " in all those years since , but with a DVD available it's possible to compare memories once again .
166620552	3903056	Re : Fantastic Lips	Yes , I had a crush on her too . She is a hard worker too . I never had problems in reminding her of anything about continuity . Other people on the shoot were like " oh , come on , it can't be that important " , but she was always awake and aware about things .
161882798	3903056	Re : How could they make it better ? ?	About the effects , I won't argue with you because I absolutely , truly hate digital effects in film these days . Maybe someday , there will be some artfulness in using them , but now it's very distracting . LIS and Irwin Allen used the same awful sounds and visuals over and over in all his TV " telefantasies " . Now come on , you know this as well as I do , so don't get lost in nostalgia on this point . You'd hear the same BING ! sound anytime an alien just appeared on the set , see the same white sparks flying around , and the same close to the camera puff of smoke anytime a new character came or left the set . . . and this went on for seven years ? ? Give me a break . If this stuff was so wonderful , then why didn't any other successful producer use it ? They didn't because even ten year olds weren't moved anymore by it . However , the Jupiter 2 crash sequence on their first planet is the most exciting piece of television from 1965 in my opinion . Every time I see it , I get excited by the fantastic imagination of it all . . . so there's alot of opinions for you .
14652989	3903056	Wonder what he does now ?	I wonder what he does now . . . He was so cute ! How come he doesn't do any more movies ? I would like to see how he looks now . I bet he has a girlfriend . Does anyone know about him now ? Please post . . . I'd like to know . hehe . I want to know what you have to say about Tom Taus Jr .
70651623	3903056	Re : Wouldn't a Cute Porn Version Be . . .	How did they get food ? She wanted to die in his arms was the concept there . Corie ( there I spelled it right ) needed Paul's lips to feel good about things , and that makes her an addict by today's standards - - they'd call it Oscular Disfunction and already have a drug treatment for it . She's addicted to kissing and stands out in a hallway knowing people are watching , which qualifies as being an exhibitionist , where she literally begs to be kissed harder and harder . For 1967 , this is really hot stuff . By Italian standards , it's less hot . There's this 1967 film called " Fiero " where the lead female character must have prolonged , extended makeout sessions with men . Watching this from the audience level must've been exceedingly squirmy , but heck we've got DVD's now !
146778647	3903056	Re : Ad Libs ?	Thanks alot for the thoughtful response on this . All the actors in this are so good and well experienced that the ad libbing makes sense now . Also Capra being the Director , could maybe have another 20 minutes of ad libs for each scene that we've looked at here , and only chosen what he thought was already funny or reinforced some other story point about the characters . Lots of actors ad lib famously , Jim Carrey being just one , and it's hell on the crew for lots of reasons . . . I being a script supervisor , must remind the actor on take 2 of all the lines that weren't in the script that he may have said the day before . Man , there isn't pay enough to make good all that , but it makes movies live forever , so be it .
28995112	3903056	Re : Fight Scene , man . . . Tuesday Weld , drunkeness	Well , I don't want to argue with someone who likes it . I keep a copy around to remind me about the power of cinema - - because it has moments that still creep me out . That fight scene . . . wow . I feel it's wrong to titillate the audience with violence , even fantasy violence . They make it seem so real . If they made it today , probably there'd be a ton of swearing , lots more sex etc . Fight scenes were a set piece back in the sixties . It was a language that meant something to the progress of a plot . Gunfights seemed to have taken the place of the macho hand-to-hand business . So watching the film seems like going back to the old home town , when it was smaller and things like that mattered . I'm glad to talk about it . It's fascinating ; it brings out my truly dark side !
114595644	3903056	Re : Hardest Working !	Mediocre , not vivid . . . boy that's really it . For example Hughes love affair and subsequent break up with Katherine Hepburn is simply a one inch deep scan of a typical romance that could happen with anyone . There is no sense of what attracts them or keeps them in the affair or how breaking up mattered . It's the kind of one dimensional affair that Charlie Kaufman mentioned as deadly of a sort and deliberatly upended with his oscar-winning screenplay " Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind " If you're not expecting original or fresh , then Logan's the man .
91018614	3903056	Re : Question about him . . .	The " good enough " line I believe especially after listening to him play bass . He's awesome , and does stuff on the bass that I've not seen anybody do except Stanley Clarke or similar jazz guys .
115529663	3903056	Did Avildsen Tinker with the Rocky Script ?	According to IMDb , a 3rd draft of Rocky using input from the producers ( i'm assuming Chartoff / Winkler and some uncredited WGA member / s ) was finished in the summer of 1975 . However , a cinema professor last night was reading lines from the January 1976 revision , and the film still resembled a character out of Sin City ( Micky Rourke's ) rather than the feel-good movie that everybody knows . Just because Avildsen was a well known producer and director by that time , that still that doesn't make him especially qualified as a writer . I wondered if Avildsen contributed anything to the dialogue - - way shorter than in the script's - - besides the visual iconography , and nobody knew . You'll notice that the original Rocky has a " written by . . . " title card with nothing else for story , screenplay , concept or any other credit . The lack of " Screenplay " credit says that maybe only the title for the script , Rocky , was kept but most everything was changed . My guess is that they had a script doctor come in and shape themes that could pay off later using as much of the original drafts as needed . I wonder who it was though , John Sayles , Goldman ?
45371313	3903056	Re : Copy on VHS ?	Wow , thanks for that . I don't have cable or television for the time being right now . But hopefully this means that more people will have copies .
25131319	3903056	Re : PG-13 ?	. . . but nothing really bad . Man , am I out of sync with people these days ! When Marin Landau gets his street justice applied with a knife in the guts , for which he issues a tortured scream , I find that to be rather personal and strong . Also the six-gun torture ( shooting Karl Malden character in both kneecaps ) to be like a porno-reel of violence . It's just obsessive interest in violence for prurient interest . ( prurient may not be in our language anymore ) But yeah the film also takes place in the heads of 1966 people , so you won't see or hear the really bad language and graphic head-busting violence of a Tarantino movie .

77154753	3903056	Same Girl ?	I saw her at a Comey's studio on Ventura blvd in late ' 06 - - she's warm , emotions right on the surface and curvacious a bit . Then comes her co-lead in Danny and the Deep Blue Sea in May-June of 2007 , and she looks rail thin like a Warhol-era heroin junky . I suppose she's the same girl , but that's quite a transformation physically . So anyway , she's a very nice theater actress .
55447876	3903056	Re : VHS available , but haven't seen it	I saw it a couple months ago , and my 75 year old teacher watched it too . For him he had to walk away-it was too stupid for him ! The girls in it are gorgeous , you gotta admit it . Robt . Morley is better than I remembered . However it's a Jerry Lewis movie without the usual Jerry Lewis bells and whistles - - and there is no compensating plot to make up for the missing comedy ingredients . I kept thinking " Austin Powers " through all the super-colorful sets and costumes . I probably won't see it again , and this was my second glance at it since the sixties , typical suburban kid's matinee of the type that doesn't exist anymore .
10976828	251856	Re : Bad Movie ?	I read the users ' comments before I saw the movie - so I wasn't expecting a lot . But I did enjoy it . Really , I think I liked it more than the other film I watched last night - " Mystic River " .

19098433	4834456	Re : slipknot	But in the end they are slotted into the Nu Metal category alongside other such worthless bands such as Evanescence , Limpbizkit , Linkin Park and Finch .

And the rest of your post shows you know * beep * all about music - you say Slipknot are " completely corporate " then you list being " catchy " as one of Disturbed's best features . Irony much ? The fact that you think Disturbed are worth any more than the other bands you listed is ridiculous . And I'm guessing the only reason you have such a problem with Finch is that they mocked the arrogant , soul-less cock stars Dis-turd . I'm not particularly into any of the bands you listed , but Disturbed are probably the most obvious examples of crappy corporate nu-metal there is . And as for the meaning in the lyrics thing ; that's a moot point , because though I'm not a big Slipknot fan , I'll admit Corey Taylor's lyrics are way , WAY above the average cookie-cutter " I hate mom , I hate dad , all the jocks call me a fag " nu metal lyrics , while Disturbed's are a load of generic , bland * beep * . Seriously read the lyrics to any Slipknot song , the guys got talent .

99895156	4834456	Re : What both Muslims and Christians need . . .	I live in East London where there is a huge Muslim population . Some of my best friends are of Muslim descent ( I wouldn't say they were Muslim since hardly anyone who's young and educated in Britain is religious ) . What it boils down to is the attitude in the area the immigrants are moving too ; London's always been a pretty progressive , liberal , open-minded city and there's little to no racism / Islamophobia across much of the city . Other parts of the UK that are a bit more backwards have problems in this area . I'd imagine it's the same in America ; despite 9 / 11 , New York's probably pretty pleasantly multi-cultural while in some random redneck Texan hick town most people probably hate the Muslims as much as they hate anyone who isn't white and endowned with a single digit IQ .

21560369	4834456	Re : I beg to differ .	That's how I'd describe it too . If you love Kevin Smith comedies , like I do , then you'll probably like this . The best thing about it was the cast , as well as Tom Green and the always-awesome Jason Lee , there's that gangster guy who's name I can never remember ( the one from Get Shorty ) , Chris Penn who I always get a kick out of seeing in movies , being a huge Reservoir Dogs fan , and Tom Berenger from Platoon & Scrubs who's also always awesome . I only rented this casue Jason Lee is in it and I wanna try and watch every movie he's been in , because he's usually the best thing in Kevin Smith's movies , but I was shocked at how good the ensemble cast for this film was . This film's not gonna be bothering the Top 250 any time soon , but if you want a decent comedy to enjoy with a group of friends you could do a hell of a lot worse than this .
20333904	4834456	Re : When are they gonna publish the Kennedy files ? ?	I know this question's probably impossible to answer , but will 100 % of the information be released , or would the government or whoever have destroyed any evidence of a conspiracy ?
20455585	4834456	X-Ray Punch	I just watched this film - I've never really been into martial arts flicks but I loved the Kill Bill movies , so they inspired to check a few out , and this was one of them . I enjoyed the movie , but there was one bit when the car got dropped off the bridge and it landed , and you could clearly see an unclothed dummy behind the wheel , but then about a minute later , the movie completely redeemed itself and then some when it showed Chiba destroying someone in x-ray vision . That was so damn cool . I was just wondering if this technique's been used in any other movies ? Cause for such a cool effect , it was used really briefly .
16557154	4834456	Re : Screw Job ?	I think if it was a work then Bret would've admitted it by now . But I do think you were right about some of what you've said .

It probably added a * beep * of heat to the Austin / McMahon feud . I definitely don't think Bret was in on it though .

21514771	4834456	Re : Not a nice guy	If I was an actor , people referring to me by the name of a character would probably piss me off as well . He does seem kind of jerky from what everyone here has said , but then again , a lot of the incidents mentioned could just be that he's having a bad day or things like that . I've got some friends who a lot of other people think are arrogant * beep * but I don't see them as being that way , since I know them really well , but I can see why people would think it of them . People don't get on sometimes , and it doesn't have to mean either one of them's a jerk , especially during your high school years . Basically , he's probably a jerk to some people or a jerk in some moods , but not in others . He seems to be a jerk more often than most people , but unless I met him and he was a jerk to me I don't really give a * beep * ( though I never watched Dawsons so I doubt I'd do anything if I saw him , I just liked him in Rules of Attraction and Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back , so I thought I'd take a look at his board and see if he's in any new movies ) .

99894294	4834456	Catholicism destroying world ?	The Catholic church continues to pursue anti-abortion agendas in countries like the United States whilst worsening the AIDs epidemic in much of Africa by telling people they'll go to hell if they use condoms . All the while the world is becoming increasingly overpopulated . Are the Catholic church persuing these destructive agendas to ensure they are the most populus religion on earth ?
102406145	4834456	Re : Catholicism destroying world ?

20885950	4834456	Re : i dont think punks dead	Ahh , but a lot of people would say Blondie and their contemporaries were new wave bands . I don't know , I guess I exaggerated punk's lack of impact in my first post , but traditional punk is a joke now . It depends on your point of view I suppose . If you look at it as punk spirit and punk attitude , I guess you could say it's still alive ( though the fact Bush got re-elected is proof that it's efforts are still pretty futile ) , but the original punk movement itself is dead . Some people see anything with a punk or anarchic attitude as being punk ; you seem to take that point of view , and I guess your idea of punk's alive and well , but people who see punk as being exclusively bands who play the same-old boring traditional punk and punk rock , well their idea of punk is pretty obselete , cause the bands are just preaching to the converted , and the original poster seemed to be one of the people who say only bands who sound like Rancid or The Exploited can be called punk . The whole idea of following a punk rock rulebook ( you can't sound a certain way or do certain things ) is just as bad as " selling out " , because it's letting yourself be limited artistically by other people's opinions of you , and basically being a poseur , living up to what punk is " supposed " to be .
131469407	4834456	I can't believe the rating . . .	This is one of the worst films I've ever seen . Apart from the immensely irritating soundtrack and god-awful acting , there's also the completely retarded scenes in which Agatha reads Jo's diary aloud ( I'm not sure which of these is stupid ; the one where she spins on her chair non-stop so the director has an ' interesting ' shot or the one where as soon as all her colleagues have left a meeting she starts reading aloud in the boardromo ) and pretty much nothing to recommend this film whatsoever . Seriously , this sucks worse than any other film I can think of . It seems to exist solely to give queer theorists something to talk about .

20204688	4834456	Re : Woe is me - the remake	I think what he's saying is that remakes , good or bad , raise the profile of the original movie . With something like Texas Chainsaw Massacre that point's irrelevant , cause everyone's at least heard of the original anyway , but with older and more obscure films like this , then I can understand why fans of the original would be pissed off ( I'd probably be pissed off if I heard there was remake being made of one of my favourite movies ) , but ultimately they encourage a few people to check out the original , which can't be a bad thing , can it ?

20460137	4834456	Re : please	Read what someone wrote about Africa a few posts up . As for respecting other people's opinions ; I think it's healthy to debate opinions on something like politics . The only time when a person's decisions or opinions shouldn't really be open to debate is if they have no effect on anybody but themselves . Politics have an impact on everybodys lives , and debating them on an internet message board is as good as anywhere , since it allows you to hear the opinions of people from different cultures who you'd never normally interact with . Plus , I think in this case , political debate is related to the movie , given it's subject matter , just as The Passion of the Christ boards are used for religious discussion that transcends Mel Gibson's movie .

The punk spirit's alive and well with multi-millionaires The Offspring and clothes designing entrepeneurs Blink 182 and all their ilk . What punk supposedly stands for - rebellion against corrupt , hypocritical authority - might be a nice idea but ultimately the punk movement changed nothing . Hell , Sex Pistols were one of the earliest manufactured bands , in that they didn't come together themselves , they were brought together . And by the way , Tupac , Elvis and Beethoven are all dead , but people still listen to them .

The thing about 9 / 11 being retalitation for the acts of terrorism carried out by the United States government ( nuking Japan , bombing the guts of Panama , Cambodia , et al . , supporting state terrorism in South Africa / Palestine ) ; well , wasn't it ? I'm not for a second condoning those horrible attacks on innocent people , but , c'mon , America's history of brutal foreign policy obviously had a good deal to do with inspiring the attacks .
20463338	4834456	Re : What material exactly did Hicks write ?	I haven't seen this show , but this is in the memorable quotes section : Denis Leary : Heavy Metal fans are buying Heavy Metal records , taking the records home , listening to the records and then blowing their heads off with shotguns ? Where's the problem ? That's an unemployment solution right there , folks ! It's called natural selection . On a Hicks show I downloaded ( I can't remember which one , I downloaded a bunch ) , Hicks makes that EXACT joke , virtually word-for-word ( except he says Judas Priest rather than Heavy Metal ) . I don't want to spark a flame war , I just want to know what the " Leary-never-ripped-him-off " side of the debate has to say in defence of that ( I might not even been in the actual Leary show , I haven't seen it , just read the quotes ) . EDIT : It's quoted slightly differently in another part of the memorable quotes section . Denis Leary : Explain it to me . Heavy metal bands on trial because kids commit suicide , what is that about ? Judas Priest on trial because my kid bought the records , and he listened to the lyrics , and he go into Satan . . . ALLALALALALALLALA ! Well that's great . That sets a legal precedent . Does that mean I can sue Dan Fogelberg for making me into a pussy in the mid ' 70s , is that possible , HUH ? I'm pretty sure Hicks made that pussy remark too .

20874749	4834456	Re : i dont think punks dead	http interpunk com item cfm Item 78939 Okay maybe I over-exaggerated a little bit , I mean I love bands like Refused who took a punk-inspired DIY attitude towards their work , but punk , as in the traditional three-chord punk sound , has become a joke . The Clash were a great band though . The punk spirit lives on in independent film and experimental bands who aren't afraid to take risks . But bands who sound like every other punk or punk rock band of the last 30 years are ironically pretty damn conformist . That's why I'd say the original punk movement is dead . I'd actually say bands like The Clash advancing the punk sound is what killed punk , because now you've got a wide range of artists like the rap group Public Enemy or hardcore bands like Dillinger Escape Plan and loads more who have much more of a punk attitude than bands like The Offspring and Blink 182 , who are corporate whores , or bands that elitist punks are more likely to listen to , like The Exploited , who just preach to the converted and are really * beep * boring . Hating emo ? Emo is just one of the many punk-inspired sub-genres that started advancing the sound but's now become over-exposed and as such has turned to * beep * All post-hardcore bands get tagged emo now , just like all metal , or even rock , bands were being labelled nu-metal a couple of years ago . But a lot of the bands who get labelled emo - like Glassjaw , Thrice - are way more " punk " than most punk bands , in that they take more risks with their sound , and Thrice , for example , have donated a percentage of their record sales to charity since they first started out . I might be a little biased , because where I live has an awesome local music scene , and there are lot of crappy hardcore bands and stuff that play shows , but the absolute worst bands are the ones that call themselves punk and rant about politics on stage , because they're * beep * idiots . They're music sucks - half the time they're playing the same awful covers , I swear I'm gonna blow my brains out if I have to listen to a half-arsed " Anarchy In The UK " or " American Idiot " again - and they do moronic things like wearing one of those NOFX " Not My President " T-shirts with a picture of Bush on it . Now that'd be fair enough if I lived in the US , I'd probably own one of those T-shirts myself , but c'mon , what kind of a moron wheres a T-shirt that says that in the UK ? Obviously he's not our president , we couldn't vote for him even if we wanted to . This is a long , rambling post , but I'll sum it up and say that everything that made punk special and exciting in the past died out and it's morals etc . were incorporated into other musical genres which themselves become over-exposed and die out , and the most important aspects of these genres then inspire the next wave of music . And on and on it goes . . .

95386063	3095456	Re : Terrible	" This film is great ! It has all the incredients to entertain a young crowd all around the world . Proof : It got already picked up by 3 major tv stations in Spain , Russia and Asia . You have obviously no clue what you are talking about neither do you seem to understand anything about directing or producing . Your comments belong to the IMDB's bottom top 10 ! " I'm thinking you're one of the film's producer's with information like this , or you're being facetious . Facts are , I saw the film , and it was awful . It couldn't get distribution in the US , or if so , very limited distribution . Your assertation that the film is entertaining because 3 TV stations picked it up in a mish-mash of countries is laughable . This is a bad product that is the bottom of the barrel of both comedy and horror . The film looks and feels cheap , the jokes are stale , the comedic timing is almost non-existant , and the story is just plain bad . I know the difference between a bad film and a low budget film that at least is making an attempt at something , and this was a bad film . I say it's badly directed because it was . Did Robert Englund even storyboard this ? He wasted the talents of Dan Franzese and a lot of other fine actors . It looked and felt cheap , like a wannabe Troma film that had less of a plot and even less to say . But okay , if you say so , it's a great film because out of the entire world , it got into 3 obscure television markets ( which won't even come close to paying back the million dollars that went to producing this movie ) .
80523724	3095456	Terrible	I saw a screening of this film , and I have to say , it's easily goiing to make IMDB's bottom 100 films of all-time . The jokes are stale , the direction is almost non-existent and what could have been a pretty good film is ruined . The funny part is , I read the original script , which I thought was funny . Somehow , not much of the humor creeps into the movie . It's a shame , because the 3 leads do their best to work with what ended up being shoddy material . Unfortunately , whether due to the interference of the producers or the ineffectualness of the director , this film is horrible .

I think his use of junk science that even he doesn't seem to understand as plot devices seemed to catch up to him in a big way on ST . I just don't believe he's that good of a filmmaker overall .
81238357	3095456	Wish she'd found her niche	I thought Some Girls was a very good first film with one of the better endings for an indie film in the last decade . She's pretty talented , and it's a shame that she's basically given up on her writing / acting career , although it's understandable since she's a mother now . As an actress , I think , if given the right role , she could excel . She's got a very vulnerable , yet tough quality while maintaining some semblence of being level-headed . Her characters always came off as mature beyond their years , and maybe that caught up with her as she got older , and that's a shame . Some actors don't find their niche until later in their career , and I hope at some point that Marissa finds her . I'd love to see her fulfil her early promise . She's still a great talent as a writer and as an actress .
147840127	3095456	Good God was this boring .	Horribly miscast , a mediocre story with a cliche ' plot directed by people who would rather make a cool looking film then have it connect with anything . I almost wanted to break the DVD from NetFlix and report it missing so nobody else would be tortured by this tedious movie . I find it rather odd that for a movie about Italian brothers was cast with two non-Italians . Dan Fogler and Brendon Sexton have seen much much better days . I realize that it was made by two first time directors , but come on . How was this entertaining , heartfelt or anything other than boring ?
35243719	8247556	Re : Do you think he'll be back ?	I was a little surprised that he just walked away not to make a reappearence later on , but I think the point of the movie was more about the mother and son than the mother and stranger . I think the stranger's real role was to reawaken that need for human contact in Lizzie . For so many years she was a closed , all-business , on-guard woman who had no desire for a connection with another person . We can see this in her very brusque manner in the beginning of the movie when she first meets Marie and cuts to the front of the queue . Her one mission in life is her son , and not to make friends or let others into her life . When Marie gently forces her way in , and offers Lizzie non-judgemental help , there has been a crack in her fortress , and the stranger allows her to break the rest of it away . His delicate persistance has opened her up to the possibility that she can perhaps try to enjoy life after all . Just as we get the impression that the stranger has also warmed a bit more to life because of this family . What I took away from the film was that " things will be ok now " because Lizzie has opened herself up to the world again , and their happiness is not really reliant upon whether the stranger comes back or not . Like another poster said , since Maria - his sister - does live there , he has reason to come back , and I like to think that if they do decide they want to be part of each others ' lives . . . they know how to get in touch . However , I hope to do NOT make a sequel . It would never meet everyone's expectations . This way , the viewer can imagine their own perfect endings , whatever directions they may take . If they were to make a sequel , it would never be as perfect as what it is we imagine in our own heads .
75568883	8247556	Re : Lexie Vs Katrina !	I think I read that Katrina actually was pregnant on the show , so maybe that's why she was unceremoniously booted out so quickly ? Maybe she was showing too much and that , along with maybe other reasons , was why they quickly got rid of her ? Doesn't Lexie eventually leave too ? I think I read that BOTH actresses got pregnant and that's why they were each written out ? Maybe i can find the link . . . Either way , i DO NOT like Lexie with Archie ! ! ! ! NOOOOO ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Lexie is obnoxious , crass , and just seems sort of loose and of little real substance . Katrina seems much better and a strong character / person in general .

75567991	8247556	What happened in Season 1 ? HELP ! ! !	Ok . . . I was recommended this series by my Netflix account , but when I got it , I really think the Netflix people screwed up the discs . . . it seems to start " in the middle of something " There is really no introduction to the series , and then on the SECOND disc , Lexie suddenly ( and inexplicably ) has brown hair . . . The disc that came in the package labeled " Series 1 Disc 1 " ( which is supposed to be the first episode of the first season must be wrong . I'm just trying to figure out what I've watched and what I don't need to order again . PLEASE tell me what season / disc number this episode is from : Justine is living in the Glenbogle House , and they are in the midst of setting up webcams . The bankers come to visit the house and undergo a supposed physical test - which is really to determine who will be the next boss . Archie and Justine break up at the end . Lexie has blond hair on all episodes on this disc . On my package labeled " Series 1 Disc 2 " - which is supposed to be the first episode , second disc the following events happen : Lexie has brown hair the whole time , Archie races into London w / Lexie on an Ice Cream truck with birds and fish for the restaurant . He and Justine are apparently still together , then she shows up at the end of the episode to live at Glenbogle , just as Archie and Katrina were about to kiss . There is also a rowing competition w / Killwillie and Archie's sister shows up with a bunch of hippies . Can anyone tell me what seasons / episode numbers these are from so I can RE-ORDER the right discs from Netflix and hopefully they'll send me the right ones ? It didn't say the Season on the DISC itself , only on the paper sleeve Netflix uses to ship the disc . On the disc itself it only says " disc 1 " or " disc 2 " with no season number . So I'm guessing Netflix didn't know which season it was either . I hope someone can help me out ! Thanks ! ! Crystal

119956600	715956	Re : were was	Yes indeed it is the same Beckton Gasworks . To get a handle on the area it was made in watch the first series of the New Avengers when they run around industrial areas , The Professionals - particularly the episode when the girl falls off the gasometer , the Roger Moore Bond movie pre-title sequence with Blofeld on the helicopter before hes dropped down the chimney . " 1984 " ( by this time the site appears to have been cleared of the piping seen in the earlier titles ) , then you have Max Headroom's original pilot seemingly made entirely in Beckton Gasworks . Possibly some sequences in " Brazil " . Then Full Metal Jacket , after its been semi demolished , with a few more Channel 4 style films & music videos . Then the last time I see a building from Beckton is in the episode of Bugs when the car goes over the unfinished bridge . You'll recognise a certain structure in the shot behind them which you'll recognise from the previous titles , and in particular Max Headroom . You'll get a shock when you realise how much of the former Beckton Gasworks brownfield site has now been built on .

128979091	715956	Re : Sad To See	I actually found this movie quite upsetting and disturbing for the very reason . The backlot was used in the Planet of the Apes TV series , Soylent Green and the music video for the Bee Gees song - ironically - Staying Alive , shot on the abandoned backlot . I believe it was Debbie Reynolds that had suggested to them that they kept the site open as a tourist attraction , but it seems that the land deal was too good to pass up . Is it entirely coincidential that the MGM British Studios ( formerly owned by Anglo-Amalgamated ) opposite Elstree Studios were also sold for a housing development at the same period ?

For example , disc 1 had dubbed episodes 1-3 with undubbed episode 31 , disk 2 dubbed 4-6 woth undubbed episode 32 . So you could watch the dubbed block of episodes , then the undubbed block , if you followed it in strict episode order . And yes , the undubbed episodes were quite dark and heavy considering the original BBC2 1970s time slot , but in tHe late night timeslot Channel 4 ( uk ) used , they would have been ok . It was later that they redubbed the " undubbed " episodes

122818967	715956	Re : ' Camelot ' as Comedy vs . Drama	Just caught the tail end of it on BBC 2 just now . It definitely felt like the cast had no idea which were they were all meant to play it . Great serious role acting , then hammy 1960s throwaway movie stylings . Some really good shots in here that look like they sneeked in from another movie . The close-up shot of the executioner towards the end was a beautiful shot that wouldn't look out of place in a modern movie . THe music didnt match th visuals either , but maybe after seeing Monty Python & the Holy Grail that didnt help . THe musical direction worked , but the casting definitely let the side down . Harris & Redgrave could have made this work with a different & proficient director , as either a comedy or a drama . So personally , it looks like the Studios choice of director let the Cast & Crew & show fans down badly . At least if it was consistenly dark drama , or light comedy it would be better .

119947738	715956	Re : Better than the modern Casino Royale	If you read the original book this movie sort of makes sense . But take the multiple bond angle , as a reference for what each bond gets up to as the overall discontinuity for the different directors then , its a bit easier to follow . But the ending is a weird one ! Watch it slotted in the order of the Sean Connery bonds , and you can see what elements of bond they are spoofing . Remember at the time there were only 4 movies before this one . Also love the extra irony , that it was made by the same Columbia pictures that would own thefranchise 40 years later ! !

It's not funny , just Canadian . Like Timmy's it is especially popular in the Maritime provinces . Not all Canadians like Timmy's or the Swiss . Just like not all Canadians like Maple Syrup ; it's is still thought of as very Canadian though . Tu comprends ?

Aside from many members of the cast , this film seems quite American . The director , writer and producers are all from south of the 49th . It also appears to have been filmed entirely in the U . S .

I'm saying that the actual CONTESTANTS are being told what to say , how to act , and what decisions to make , in order to make the show " more interesting . " < < < < Hate to break it to ya Skippy , but your assertion is ILLEGAL under Federal law thanks to Van Doren , Stempel and the whole Twenty-One debacle in the 50s . To tell you how seriously that is taken : I was on a sports trivia quiz show on cable back in 2000 . We were told on our way down from the green room that we could not mention anything about sports trivia , etc . or else we would be taken off the show because if there were even an appearance of misgiving , then the show could be taken off the air and the producers subjected to Federal Prosecution ( and no , I'm not an actor , I'm just a regular guy . ) So when we're there walking out , and they are playing " We Are Family " in the studio , of course the first thing I think of is the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates . However , I had to keep that to myself , which was the best thing that could have happened because the 36-inch TV I won on that show still works great to this day . Bottom line : Neither IDENTITY , nor DOND , nor 1 vs . 100 or any of the others are staged , rigged or otherwise as it relates to the contestants . Otherwise , how on earth would someone with the answers not get Jerry Mathers right off the top ? PLEASE , think people before you speak . Or at least do some research .

I phoned Universal Studios today and they don't even acknowledge making the movie , and it was made clear to me that they are not seeking public opinion as to what to re-release in any case . So it looks like a lost cause . As mentioned elsewhere , royalties could be an issue . The DVD was a bad pressing , so anybody with a working copy should BACK IT UP . I was able to watch mine only once . The VHS version is quite inferior , but it's all we have nowadays ( they've almost stopped making VCR players , so keep yours maintained ! ) .

116449865	9021456	Re : Why couldn't it have been Cedric the Entertainer ?	OP : Very bad taste . You don't wish death on other people , especially not an actor just because you don't like his work .
145774672	9021456	Re : Who is this chump ?	This thread is dumb . His character has like 3 lines in the whole movie and he did a fine job with the screen time he got . You could have put a " known actor " in place of him and he wouldn't have done any better .
164306691	9021456	Re : about 75 to 80 % of it is fantastic . . . the rest of it	I agree with op . Me and my wife came out of the movie quite frustrated at how the whole movie just went bonkers and hollywood on us . It had the potential to be a very touching movie about their relationships but it ended in a bloodbath and a guy cheating on his girlfriend with an alien . Totally stupid .
161356568	9021456	Re : I thought he was just going to be a flash in the pan	Eventually it'll die off . I think he'll have to stick to voice acting for most of his career .
164306414	9021456	Re : LOVED the movie HATED the ending * spoilers *	Yea everything after he has sex with her was completely stupid and ruined a potentially great movie . They should have focused on the relationship parents / " kid " and PERHAPS have the ending be something like what we got but without all the hollywood BS . Like having her turn from their sweet child into a violent monster would have been a great story to follow .
164382598	9021456	Re : The Karate Kid . . . learning Kung Fu ?	They named it Karate Kid because Americans wouldn't be as attracted to the movie if it was named Kung Fu Kid .
151456775	9021456	Re : Oscar Buzz ?	i thought he was great as well . It's rare that a child can hold up scenes on their own like he did . there were a lot of zooms on his face , emotional scenes , complex emotions , etc and he handled it all superbly . During the movie i noted to my gf that he reminds me a bit of a young Johnny Depp .
164926257	9021456	Re : The missing ' A ' - spoilers	Thanks for pointing it out . We didn't notice it on our only viewing . We're not as smart as the above poster , sadly .
164526305	9021456	Re : The ' twist / ending ' ruined the entire thing . ( spoilers )	I agree with op . The ending was completely retarded and Hollywoodesque in its badness . This film had great potential to do something special but instead chose to give us a bowl of crap .
56109846	8777056	Re : Question about ending ( spoilers )	I think most of the posters make valid points about the last scene , but I would like to offer a supplemental factor . After 20 years even a ' handsome ' man would look ' ordinary ' to a young girl . Maybe the ex-cop realises ( amongst all the other emotions he has ) that the very last clue had become worthless . . .
63578402	8777056	Re : My favorite film	Thanks !
61947447	8777056	Re : Ok what the hell ?	The movie was also designed to make the most feeble minded viewer who watched it go stark raving bonkers and make her or him post compulsively on this forum . Eventually the poor creature will die of exhaustion . In the afterlife she / he / it will be forced to watch this intriguing movie in an endless loop without the comfort of copying nor pasting . Truly , a remarkable movie .
63371401	8777056	Re : BRI / OOU what does it stand for ?	BRI = Brigade de Recherche et d'Intervention ( Investigation and Intervention Brigade ) , the unit of Léo Vrinks .

Pronunciation : ( Qai sounds like the Spanish ' Qué ' ) Kay dayz Orfaivre . ay = like in ' say ' , but shorter ; ai in orfaivre like in ' dairy ' or like the ' a ' in laser ; the end s is mute .

60268140	8777056	Re : My favorite film	Could somebody please explain the after-the-credits bucket-thing ? Exactly what happens ? With some details , please . I am so used that they cut of the end credits that I switched the TV off . When I read about the ending I realized that this was one of the channels that actually shows them . Arrgh ! Loved the film , and practically all that I have read here I agree with , but the second half I was waiting for the bucket thing to happen . . . Very frustrating .
63764966	8777056	Re : A missed twist - anyone else notice this ?	Very interesting . Let me add to the confusion : one of the meanings of ' cypher ' is a man of no importance , a nobody . Of course that begs the question who exactly the cypher is , but logically it would be the protagonist , Sullivan .
61621669	8777056	Re : If He Wasnt A Paedophile ?	When they search his darkroom you can clearly see that he has many , many pictures of both men and women , both young and old . Remember , he wanted to make a ' photographic history ' of the island , so naturally he has taken many pictures in many places . The girls were amongst them because they were beautiful and attractive . That is also the reason they were murdered . The real murderer raped them , Henry photographed them . In that sense it is no coincidence that they caught the eye of both men . When he says that he likes young girls / women he states only a ' biological ' fact . Almost everybody will feel more attraction to younger members of the species . From a Darwinian point of view this is logical because it promotes the survival of the species . But feeling a certain attraction and giving in to it in an inappropriate way are two different things . I think his situation is still more complicated : in young girls he sees also the children he doesn't have and would have loved ( as a father ) to bits . When his wife denies him sex , he seeks it with young prostitutes in a swift an angry way . His unfulfilled love for children is a separate emotion that eventually becomes mixed up with all the rest . I know , but life can be complicated . So , was he actually a pedophile ? He certainly loved children . So do most parents and so did Jesus . Did he have sex with persons under the culturally determined acceptable age ? Almost certainly not : for that purpose he uses prostitutes . His tragedy is that he is not a criminal but just a weak man and that he is needlessly frustrated in his deepest longings by his wife whom he nevertheless loves .
63574838	8777056	Re : A plotline i didn't understand . . . . . .	I suppose they couldn't risk Fitch finding out that he was the only one that got an offer because it would blow their cover . After all they knew him and his methods already . Remember , Fitch and Rohr saw each other getting an identical ' jury for sale ' envelope in public and this made it believable for Fitch that the offer was genuine .
63577569	8777056	Re : BRI / OOU what does it stand for ?	Pronunciation : No no no ( funny , though ) . Written in ' English letters ' it would be Kay-dayz-Orfaivre . You got the address exactly right . Everybody in France knows ( well , most people I think - am from Belgium myself ) that this is where the headquarters of those police departments are . Like when you say " 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue " and most ( American ) people would know that you mean the White House .

7070115	3210056	Re : The Ending - Some help please	Here's the deal from my view . He thought he had it all together after the blow up with Alex and the big hug of reconciliation . He thought he had cooly deflected Sarah with the comment in the car ( in fact he is feeling pretty noble and all for leaving that situation without going any further . ) With the phone call she upsets his world again and he sinks to the bottom realizing , basically , he's screwed now because he has strong feelings for Sarah and to a lesser extent , Alex . He's between a rock and a hard place and he knows it . Hoew is he going to juggle this one ? What to do ? Sink and think . Just a guys view of the scene .

67084025	12009456	Re : Kevin interview with Filmstew	i watched both shows and even as a litle girl growing up watching them i could see that they gave xena more attention . i think rob and sam totally screwed him . he almost lost his life for hercules and they didn't appreciate him . he has every righjt to be angry if this happen to bigger star rob and sam would have heard worst . it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all

67321518	12009456	Re : Kevin interview with Filmstew	i'm getting tired of this topic and look kevin hasn't done badly in his carrer . after seven seasons of hercules , he had another successful tv show andromeda for five years , he guest starred on hi tv prime tv shows like dharm a and greg and was excellent loved him , was on hope and faith , and other prime shows . he was a special co host on regis and kelly he hosted the show with kelly i think usually the pay the celebrity co-host to come on , then he came again this regis and kelly was interviewiing him , he has very succesful furniture line , he was on the abc talk show on the view , he has done a few movies which are alright . he did a very successful movie with lifetime and now seven epsides on the show . . i think he's doing good for all the kevin detractors and he and lucy are on the same level so i'm now thinking why is so bitter against her . her career hasn't hit sky rocks either despite the fact she's rob's wife . as much as i agree he has right to be angry i think he should have said differently and not bring any cheap shots at lucy and rob . i read interview again and i think it was no class . that is totally no help to his career and he's pushing fifty although he doesn't look it . hey if he wants job he should try the daytime or primetime . he could play a doctor , a cop or something hero cuz he has this good guy look . i'm done talking about this i just waiting for what sam , rob . lucy would have to say then i'll talk again . i'm done for now it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all
54165356	12009456	Re : Kevin Sorbo The Best Hercules EVER .	yes he was the best hercules ever the hercules in the real greek myths was such a womanzier and very violent that if they made a show about the myth herc i would not watch . kevin made almost every womanand girl fall headless in love with hercules and every guy wanted to be him . kevin portray hercules with such grace and gave us viewers a moral compass we needed that we didn't get so much in xena . I HATE XENA i guess i am in the minority . anyways he was the best hercules ever .
121204976	12009456	Re : Just a little clarification . . .	this is only a recent thing the ancients never had ideas about black or white especially those from the medtereran sea who were olive brown skin color both egyptians and greek alike . and eventually the ptomely dynasty mixed they did mixed it was once in a while but they did . never listen to white historian who think white are supeior and never listen to a black historian who think blacks are superior . the ancients really did not have race and all that racism thing this a fairly recent idea about 500 years it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all

57019768	12009456	Re : Kevin Sorbo The Best Hercules EVER .	by being perfect all the time ? comment i could see you never watched a full season of hercules hercules wasn't perfect all the time ! ! ! ! the first episode proves that . when hera kills his wife hercules goes into a rage where he refuses to help people and there are many episodes where hercules doesn't act perfect example when iolaus dies and how he acts around zeus . ok if acting like a vengeful , angry , violent female dog like xena where she cannot not keep her rage in check only a certain idealist irritating self rightoueus blond was the only who could keep it check is good then i want to be " be perfect all the time " like hercules at least he was a realist and wasn't self rightous and did know how to keep his rage in check most of time . the world does not need a xena it's m , ore a hercules we need
114176637	12009456	Re : Are all episode stand-alone ?	i think so too but somehow i don't think judgement day was the end i know i am grasping at straws here but in the xena espiode of animal attraction when xena finds out she's preggers gabby ask if it's ares or hercules . so if that statement is true i thinking off screen before xena and gabby went to india and all that and when herc came back to greece etc xena and hercules were probably thinking of getting back together . gabbrielle would not ask a question like that if there was not a possiblity of that . i know people would say morrigan and hercules were together but she left greece . and in good fearing child i have a problem with this epsiode and i have seen it a million times . i don't care how good and kind and just hercules is ! i would never kill his father i know zeus gave him no choice but i still think TPTB could have think of a better way and i think here was some unresolved feelings betwwen hercules and xena at least on herc's part . my friend and i were discussing this with a friend and she agrees with me and she saw god fearing child a million times too . i know am grasping at straws but that's what my mind is telling me ever time . i know some people the xena and romance ended in prometheus but if it did end there why was iolaus so in a hurry to get to herc before word a mouth got . i agree with roman though the romance came to an offical conclusion onjudgement day but i still think there were unresolved feelings between our two heros . that's my two cents anway it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all

154657591	12009456	Hercules relationnship with his immortal siblings and cousins	i was just watching some old episodes of Hercules , mostly the ones with his sister Aphrodite , it seems to me that even though he and zeus were not getting along and hera hated him he seems to have gotten along pretty well with his brothers and sisters with exceptions of Ares , Apollo , and Discord and his cousins Strife and Demos . i say that by the way he gets along with Aphrodite , it looks like they have a loving relationship and will do anything for each other , yeah they fight and have their little squabbles and hercules doesn't like some of stuff she does but which which brother and sister doesn't . he also seems to get along with his other godly relatives find like Triton , Hades , Persephone maybe except his aunt Demeter , i think he talks about the Poseidon in an episode . i just notice that . I think if Hercules can get along with Aphrodite great , he probably got along with Athena and Artemis wonderful , i just wish they had develop his other sisters and brothers . i think hercules relationship with Aphrodite and of course Ares can give us an idea of which silbling he did and did not have a friendly relationship . i just wish they had showed more of the gods . what u guys think it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all

67197383	12009456	Re : Kevin interview with Filmstew	well i think kevin , lucy , rob and sam should sort out their issues before things get out hand . it makes me wonder if any of the hercules stars and guest stars feel the same way kevin does we only have wait i hope alexandra tydings - aphrodite , robert trebor - salmonus , michael hurst - iolaus , bruce campbell - autocuyulus , karl urban - cupid / casear meighan desomand - discord , rene o'connor-gabby joesphanie davison who played many roles on both herc and xena , and jobel tobeck-strife / demos at least make a statement and play peace makers cuz i read somewhere all of them became friends while filming herc and xena . maybe too kevin it seemed that rob ansd lucy started dating right of her divorce look she got divorce in july and starting dating rob in octobeer that ; s too close to call . well both hercules and xena were fablous shows herc until the fifth and xena until the four . they invented awhole new genre the fantasy / action / adventure shows . i think both shows could have enjoyed the same popurlaity if rob and sam paid the same attention . they could have hercules travelled more from the begining , bring a gay subtext , and other things . xena and hercules are basically the same only that xena was much darker and the lebesian subtext . oh well i think this issue needs to resolved i think everybody just say sorry i offended you to each other both sides and end this madness . it makes no sense . i'm both a lucy and rob fan and a kevin fan . i refuse to ber torn for senseless bickering it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all
122005388	12009456	Re : Republican	ok you need a history refersher i am not american but i do know and studied american history . the republican party was the party that before that supported slavery abolitation black rights etc , in facct it was under an republican president and party that slavery was ended in 1865 Abrahamn Linclon he fact this presdient Obama has been qoting all through his campian , second the democrat party came from the old ferdalist party supporters and they were anti poor and anti black , thirdly it was just only a little over 60 years ago when FDR became president during the depression and world war 2 that the democrat party became the party fror poor and colored people , he fact FDR's family was republican his uncle was a republican president . what i am trying to say not because one is democrat or republican that says they like or don't like poor and colored . the party lines have change and this election proved it's changing , republicans voted democrat some at the last moment some , early , so to point blank come out and say he ' cannot stand poor people or people of color is outright wrong . where is your proof and evidence . i am sure there are democrats that cannot stand poor and colored people , as i am sure there are some republicans but this has nothing to do with party or what the party stands for because both parties have changed and are changing , there's no longer blue or red states , this election is clear , kevin sorbo could have switch at the last moment , a lot of republicans did , or might have still voted mccain but who voted for or what party he's part of does not tell you if he's prejudice or not it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all
113905229	12009456	Re : kevin is costarring in a movie coming christmas 08	me too i hope it's better than meet the spartans but you are to remember these two movies are different genres so i don't think we'll be able to compare them . anyways i am so excited that kevin , lucy , renee and michael are in a movie together . i wonder if lucy and kevin sort their differences because of the interview he gave . because on a website she only talked about rennee and michael never indicated that kevin was in the movie . oh well michael is friends with both of them and the movie is produced and directed by a hercules and xena director and producer what a reunion . i heard kevin and lucy don't share scences but i'll happy their are in a movie together hopefully they work in the future and share scences . they had great chemistry together in all the xena and hercules crossover epsiodes . well i saw the preview and wasn't impressed but i'll give the movie a chance before i judge it it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all

93532148	12009456	Re : Annoyed Greek girl	first of all though i'm not american i will say americans and people from the westen hempisphere came from differents part of the world , there are greeks in america , they are americans who have greek ancenstry . second you should read the disclaimers , thirdly they were not trying to humilate your history in fact because of xena and hercxules , troy , alexander people are now more interested in greek history and mythology people are now reading the accurate myths and history . viewers know it's fiction and they look it up to see the differences because of these two shows there are widely renewed interest in greek myths and history . foutrhly it's not only greek history they messed with you not hear the romainans complaining about the herc vampire epsiode , you don't hear the british complaiining about king arthur and merlin and the xena epsiode about bodecia , you don't hear the italians complaining about caesaer , mark anthony , brutus , you don't hear the irish complain about morrigain and the eire epsiodes , you don't hear the egyptians complaining the mummy epsiode , nefeterin , cleopatra , you don't hear the iraqis complain about the swumerian epsiodes , you don't hear the jews and christians complain so much ! how about the east indians , the chinese , the japanese . norse myths were also tampered with so should the people of norway , sweden . iceland get upset but they not . fifthly the same way you think americans have a misconception about greece , you have a misconception about americans you should be educated . it's a free world let me edcuate you america , canada and rest of the western hemsphere aqre inhabited by blacks , arabs , jews , east indians , british , greeks , italians , chinese , japanese , french , people from germany , iceland , sweden , norway , native american indians . so most of us have ancestery from more than one group . so i should say since i have greek , french , and indian and black ancestry . everyone's hiustory is ours to do what we please . you should watch the show maybe you'll be edcuated and see it's not only greek history and myths and the title of this post should be annoying greek girl that's my two cents it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all
114474237	12009456	Re : I just finished watching all 6 seasons !	bond _ 98 um everything you stated it's the reason why i prefer hercules more xena . i liked xena too but most time it was about either xena saving her which was not only in the first season it happen until season five and even then , or ares trying to tempt xena or xena slipping into her darkside i just thought xena was just a soapopera especailly in season five and six and xena and gabby were hypricotes as far i was concerned . with hercules it's different like u i prefer the hercules character than the xena one . i personally just have a problem with xena and callisto though i like them especially their reasons for being evil etc . hercules has been through just the same or more than xena and yes at times he was nearly pushed off the edge but he always find his way back . xena complains about wanting to be forgiven etc but she fails to realize she already was and it's a choice a choice she made . another reason why like hercules more xena in hercules you don't have to die to save and release 40 , 000 souls to be redeem what a crock ! with hercules from the moment you decide to stop ur evil ways you are forgiven you don't need to be hero like xena or release 40 , 000 souls to redeem ur yourself . hercules got the redemption issue right but xena didn't . i could state another reasons why hercules it's much better than xena but it's their different approaches of the theme redemption that gets me hercules approach was right on the money . that's my two cents it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all

131991889	12009456	Re : Best moment in the show ?	well i have some many but my best moment is at the end of unchained heart when hercules and xena were saying goodbye and when xena was riding off hercules had a smile on his face it almost seemed like he knew she was going to be great and my second best is full circle where herc and iolaus walk off in the sunset it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all
114483672	12009456	Re : I really liked the Norse Episodes	ok i loved the norse epsiodes what i don't get since herc and xena on the two shows lived around the same time how come odin is young on xena and where is frigg , thor that were hercules because later on xena they deal with norse mythology . ok another timing thing i have a problem on the last season of hercules nefertini was queen and on season five a couple of epsiodes after god fearing child cleopatra is queen of egypt . yeah i think in a early season of hercules on the epsiode of mummy there was a egyptian princess and in season three or season two of xena can't remember clopatra . what's up with that ? cuz i know to understand some herc epsiodes u must watch xena and vice versa but i don't get what i mention above it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all

52798515	12009456	do you think he and lucy lawless should reunite ?	well first i have to say that i don't think kevin is out of a job some actors sometimes after a television show don't always come back right away . look at teri hachter on desperate housewives she after lois and clark did some radio shack ads and some bad movies but hey she back after a couple of years on a great show it could happen with kevin he might win an emmy next time around . now i think after more than six years of not working together he and lucy should reunite to do something like a series or movie or something maybe it will bring back their careers which shows proimse i think they both deserve emmys . they both great actors show biz history when has actor who have had one succesful series comeback with another succesful series very few i think kevin had two successful series one after the another so if he's out of work now maybe he is taking a vaction or something because he beat the odds lucy after xena i don't think i really heard much about her but kevin after hercules came with andromeda that has got to tell you something if he's out work this year or for two or five years or more he'll be back with something better than hercules and andromeda . GIVE THE MAN A CHANCE ! ! ! GIVE HIM A BREAK ! ! HE'LL BE BACK BETTER AND STRONGER .

82248092	12009456	Re : Historical question	yes and no peron had sympathies for germany and many german officials supposely fled to argentina but no the jews and other races did not suffer perescution from eva and peron . like many historians say eva and juan were paradoxes and contractions . peron was certainly a dicator but he had sympathies with the poor , peron was a tyrant but he certainly did not kill anyone using force that oppose him , peron and eva enriched themselves but they did a lot for the lower class for both of them were weary of the upper class . so like i said peron and eva were contradictions it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all

82179773	12009456	Re : first wife	peron's first wife died of the same disease that evita died of . she was a teacher , she spoke english , italian and other languages . she was well edcated . he did adopt a daughter with her but i don't know what happen to her anyways it is said he loved both evita and his first wife very much and was devasted when they died , when evita was diagonised with the cancer it is said peron was badly shaken because his first wife died of the same disease . evita was everything to peron his lover , his friend , supporter , wife , campainer , his unofficial co regent , his equal and of course it is said they were wellmatched . and in both eva's and peron's memoirs it's clearly seen how much they loved each other . evita wanted to buried with him and he with her but today they bodies are so far apart . he was also relucant to marry his third wife . and they found evita's embalmed body it is said he cried and kept with him until his death in 1975 and it was his third wife isabelle who buried evita in the family tomb totally ignoring her husbaands wishes and evita's . evita also told a maid she was happy with peron before she died and peron said the same thing to a journalist before he died . evita told peron she didn't want to be forgotten and he promised her it wouldn't happen that's why he embalmed her body although evita never knew it was what he had planned . anyways evita and peron were soulmates it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all

67173820	12009456	Re : Kevin interview with Filmstew	you know when i start to think about as much as he had every right to be angry . i think he should have been a little calmer about it and he shouldn't have used such profanity . i think both he and lucy are both great actors and have done really well for syndicated tv stars cuz most of those syndicated tv stars just disappear after the breakout show ends . although some peole think kevin is no where in the indusry and lucy is better ofthan him . but i and others seem to think right now they are on the same level . but kevin i guess needed to sort his issues with sam rami and rob . i saw the clip on his site where imitates rob i think he was just joking i don't think he has problem with rob tapert or lucy i think it's sam he has the problem with . sometime ago i posted are lucy lawless and kevin sorbo friends many of us said yes but now i think we have rethink that although before andromeda cancelled he was planning to have both lucy and bruce campbell on but you know what happen to andromeda . you know most of the actors on both xena and hercules were either british , new zealanders , australians rene o conner and kevin were among the few americans and i think they made sacfices to filmed in new zealand cuz it will be harder for them to take up other jobs . so i think he's in his right but should have handle it better . i wondering what bruce campbell thinks since he rob and sam went college together but he became really good friends with kevin on hercules and it wass hercules he guest starred until the last season while xena it was until the fourth . i wondering about the other cast herc and xena shared how do they feel about this statement . i also think rob and sam should apolize to kevin and vice versa cuz both paries did parties wrong . well that's just my two cents . oh by the way there was atime when i liked xena better than hercules but that was until xena got too slutty and gabby got to self righteous it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all

74931208	12009456	Re : Xena Q	you know i think xena and hercules met after bitter suite and armagaddon and before sacfrice and the hercules dahok epsiodes and told each other what happen . i think when xena told him about dahok he told her about the dagger and then after sacrfice remember hervules knew ares allied with dahok so i think xena told him and he keep all his information from iolaus but by the time hecr and iolaus arrive in sumeria it's obvious he knows something . you know i always wondered about his reaction about this whole hope and dahok fricasco i think he wasn't angry or anything at xena and gabrielle . i think he would have asked xena why she didn't come to him for help and all and be a comfort to xena and gabbrielle for the loss of their children . and you know i think hercules and xena lost touch just when he came back to greece and xena and gabby went india . that's what i think it's better to love and lose to love than not to love at all

Couldv'e ended with Yen taking a shot of whiskey all Cowboy style , but it tried to be like a Shakespearean catastrophe ( as in Hamlet , where everyone dies ! ) . It just killed the mood for me , since Donnie Yen gets one speech in the entire film while the others get all emotional on Father's Day .

61895455	1810582	Re : what is this ?	What this show is : Phillip K . Dick and Isaac Asimov snorting cocaine and blurting out fantastic ideas while Japanese people take notes . . . . What this show is not : Cowboy Bebop . . . . Coolness : " Thom Yorke approved " material of the dystopian drama complete with robots , cyborgs , and religion . . . . Suckness : Japanese Emo movement , continuity factors between episode 20 and 21 , total lack of humor ( unless you count the little-girl robot ) , and made for the pseudo-intellectual Emo-generation . . . . Demographics : Likely to appeal to male and female twenty-somethings of a college-education level feeling the burn from more complicated anime , such as " Ghost in the Shell : S . A . C . " Appealing to fans of Ridley Scott's " Blade Runner " / Phillip K . Dick's " Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? " Slight variation in fans of " Fight Club . " . . . Suggestions for Viewing : It explains itself endlessly so you won't have to restart if you trip somewhere in the middle . This can also be annoying at times , since you've watch twenty episodes that all have flashbacks in them , and then they finally drop the bomb shell in the last three . Thankfully , the filler episodes are more enjoyable than the story since they focus on character development rather than constant reminders of past occurrances , kind of like " The X-files . "

Then again , he's basically a mercenary Captain America , which may fall into the " outlandish .

So , he faked his death . . . but he's in the background . . . but that's Two-Face . . . and Two-Face is not Hush . . . so , who the hell's in the background at the beginning ? I don't really like Loeb's twists , not even the one for Long Halloween . It's confusing and derails half the journey . I know older readers that follow the vast continuity like Morrison's run . I can't . He's harder to love than a hostile porcupine .

166199916	1810582	Re : You should never listen to fanboys	Going off reactions of viewers , it seems the only people that liked it were fans of the show that didn't mind the awful pacing , soulless acting , and bleak visuals .

150158797	1810582	Re : Jet Li topic - Fist of Legend or Fearless	Bruce Lee could have been a drug-addict and a womanizer . At least he wrote some great philosophy . What did Huo Yuanjia do for ANYONE ? . . . Well . . . he was sort've the Asian equivalent of Jack Johnson . . . . never mind .
149961117	1810582	Re : Jet Li topic - Fist of Legend or Fearless	Fearless was also a little more respectful of the man he fought . But , even then , Fist of Legend made the step toward this with Chen Zhen developing as a tolerant , multicultural master . He's not about " Chinese is best " like the Bruce Lee film . I still think it's terrible that the death is played out like some big conspiracy in both movies . Even if he was poisoned , it's not like some huge historical moment . I think I enjoyed Fist of Legend better , though the weapon-based combat in Fearless was amazing .

There's too many story elements to take care of when filmmakers are already trying to make a message about prejudice .

160297128	1810582	Re : Just beat GoW3	I liked Nero's controls . They sorta made Dante's controls look like sh ! t . Also , in defense of DMC2 : DMC2 was the least emo of the series . Dante's more grown and trash-talks less . Lucia's the best female character they made for the series because she's not only playable , but seriously throws down . Look at Trish and Lady , then back to Lucia . Lucia's f _ ckin ' awesome . I don't see how it was out of character for the brooding hero to finally grow up after killing his brother once and for all and start pimping out his business . And with a story that introduced new characters , it was less fan-fiction trash than part 3 . The ending of part 2 makes me disappointed with the wave of prequels these games are getting . These stories need to move on from Dante's gay-assed twin , already . I'd rather fight my way out of Hell as Dante from those games than any other character . So . . . just because the controls and camera sucked , doesn't mean it was everything else that sucks .

164266533	1810582	Race-issues aside . . . will this movie be too serious ?	The trailers look very moody . I don't know that a serious tone will help the films throughout an entire trilogy . Part of what made Aang's destiny so powerful was that he matured over time . He started out childish , but would ultimately have to face the villain in a fight to the death . It was that lingering plot-point that enhanced his transformation in the cartoon . But , looking at this movie , Aang's moody and presented in a fashion that doesn't resemble a child at all . Neither are any of the other young characters . Perhaps I should overlook this based on the fact that the cartoon had over 60 episodes to achieve transformations for many major characters , while the films will get 2 hour run-times at most . Sokka was first presented with a warrior-attitude and immediately after as the comic-relief , but he did manage to grow as a much more serious character , even within Season 1 . I don't know if the film will allow that , in favor of his romantic sub-plots . I guess the gist of my concern is that all the characters seem to have fully accepted their roles already , diminishing their development in order to keep up with key moments relative to the cartoon . I won't say " I'd rather they made a movie for every episode " because that's ludicrous . What it breaks down to is what key moments are expendable ? I see that they've cast Yue , but how was she important to the whole series ? How did she advance Aang's journey outside of her three episode existence ? Did they need General Zhao ? There are a lot of plot-points that can be cut in favor of character development , in essence , freeing up time to remind the audience that the characters are still growing up . If Aang is so serious , you won't believe his self-doubt . The moral dilemma that is his fate won't be presented as threatening as it was in the cartoon . It sort of makes me scared that these characters are all written so soullessly adult .

The guys in the background without weapons seem to automatically win by kicking and punching the enemy . Sokka only uses Boomerang once . Bending takes forever and Firebenders are going by " Pyro-from-X-men " rules . Aang seems to have no problem later on in a scene that looks as choppy and effects-laden as a Zack Snyder slow-motion action-sequence . By then , all he does is look at people and water hits them , which is less fun than watching a G-rated Scanners . Other than that , the bending is all Tai Chi and less " striking . "

The best option would be for Superman to fight somewhere like Apokalips , against like-powered enemies .

Big intricate top . . . exposed panties . Taki's boobs were upgraded , and Shura's boobs are so massive that they create an error in the graphics where the hilts of her katanas phase in and out of her breasts . Why are those secondary swords even there ? She has four swords ? She only uses two ! There are about 5 masculine woman faces . . . out of 8 . Then again , I only stuck with two female faces in part 3 , so , what the hell . The Star Wars characters are iffy . I haven't played Vader yet . Starkiller doesn't even need the friggin ' force guange because some of his moves are unblockable anyway . Yoda feels a bit of a screw-up . He has a bunch of 2 hit combos , and no real force attacks . And , yeah , I too feel a bit pissed that the moves have changed . Zasalamel's Down-Back A , A combo is gone . Ivy's given this weird transformation system . And Yung Seung doesn't even have any of the combos from SC2 anymore . I think they could've at least incorporated the Chinese Sword ( Dao ) style from SC3 into Yung Seung this time around ( with that awesome A+K attack ) , but they didn't . I think the big thing that pisses me off is that there are no longer any of the generic styles you could give your character in SC3 . The restriction system on the costumes also pisses me off . There were no restrictions on costumes in SC3 ( as in " if you want this piece you'll have to give up 3 others because they're not compatible " ) . Lightsabres are not available . . . and I was hoping Kilik would get Darth Maul's sabre . You can't even customize ( you get invisible jewelry instead ) the guest characters , who don't even have animated endings , and their weapons aren't available in their source styles . Anyway . . .

The Tight-Shirt is a little loose-fitting ( weird , huh ? ) , and you'll need fore-arm length gloves . Power Girl's boots are a lot shorter . . . but since the leggings are so high with the Belle-Dress , I really had no choice . Elektra ( Marvel ) Taki ( w / Long Hair : Black ) [ She's got these jitte-swords that look like Sais ] Pirate Bandana / Skull Cap ( everything is red ) Bong-Seon Shoulder * Tight Leather Bodysuit Kunoichi Robe ( * Shoulder straps replaced ) Bandages [ Arms ] Bandages [ Socks ] Coments : When I first made her I used the Kitty Sash rather than the Kunoichi Robe . I late found out those weird shoulder straps go away if you put other shoulder-equipment on . The Bong-Seon shoulders are a little less noticeable than the others , since they're on one side . I've seen vids using Talim's style , but I think Taki's is a little more suitable . . . and she's got bladed-jittes , the closest things to sais . Scoprion [ female-version ] ( Mortal Kombat ) Ivy Monk's Hood ( Black ) Spy Mask ( Gold ) Scarf ( Black ) Bong-Seon Shoulder [ optional / interchangeable ] ( Gold ) Border's Suit ( all Black ) Spy Robe ( Gold ) Raven Gloves ( Gold , Fabric : Black ) Scorpion Greaves ( Gold ) Comments : Yeah . . . a girl Scorpion . . . . . . It actually looks better than all the male ones . And since the Spy Robe is working with the Border suit . . . boobness is a little less distracting . This formula can be used to make a Sub-Zero or a Reptile ( etc . ) , one of my later customs was a Setsuka custom with her Lizard Umbrella with the look of Reptile . Kato ( Green Hornet ) Maxi ( w / Corporate Cut ) Officer's Hat ( everything is black ) Thief's Mask [ One of the Chinese robes ] Leather Gloves Dueler's Pants Leather Boots Comments : IT'S BRUCE LEE ! Wonder Woman ( DC ) Ivy ( w / Long Hair : Black ) Bong-Seon Circlet ( Gold ) Belle Dress ( Blue , Leggings : Red or White ) Tiger Lily Breastplate ( Top : Gold , Sides : Red ) Leather Armlets ( Silver ) Princess Shoes ( Red ) Comments : I used the same concept I did with the Power Girl custom ( using Belle-Dress ) , but this was more because I didn't like the look with the Hunter Suit . The weapon choice makes a lot of sense if you remember the whole " lasso " thing . Wolverine ( Marvel ) Custom : Voldo Cat Claws Viking Helmet ( Yellow and Black ) Usurper's Mask ( Black ) Guardian's Pauldrons [ ? ] ( Blue ) Usurper Suit ( Yellow and Black ) Death's Gauntlets ( Blue ) Warlord's Belt ( Red and Blue ) Traveler's Boots ( Blue ) Comments : Kinda crappy . . . but , the best I got so far in terms of Wolverine Customs that don't use Katanas .

Seriously . I loved playing these " few and far between " battles more than my recent gaming experiences . Hell , more than Uncharted 2 . It's why I have a save in the South America chapter , just so I can actually play , but that just explodes with how overbearing the story got . . . . I didn't mind the story . It's mostly conclusive , if you were paying attention at all . I don't fault you if you didn't . The reason why parts 1 and 3 were great was because they were more tributes to the genre than contributions to a continuity . Part 4 just sort of has to deal with closing everything in this abusively inclusive style , where even Mei Ling of all people returns . I think I may have skipped some important scenes or just plain forgot them . . . because I have no idea when they started talking about " Fox-Alive . "

Once you get a Quasar or a Captain Marvel or a Thor in that battle , Martians don't stand a f _ ckin ' chance !
164693044	1810582	Re : ' Rebirth ' Concept = Unnecessary	I like the pitch , but I do agree with the finding of these problems . I do find it sad that he didn't choose characters like Kano or Kabal for the pitch . It's awful that he chose to make Baraka into Kroenen from Hellboy and Reptile into a more improbable version of Killer Croc . Hopefully , if he gets to make it , it won't have these things .
160675832	1810582	Re : OT : The Red Skull ? Cosmic cube ?	I don't see how hard it would be for the villain to get caught in an explosion ( or fall off a cliff ) near the end leaving his whereabouts inconclusive . We are going with the whole bit about Red Skull being superhuman , right ? I think he'll have a Shredder death . . . you know . . . like in the Ninja Turtles movies . Hah .

163156038	1810582	Re : Marvel movies have better sequels ?	Add the number 2 to a Marvel movie . . . it's a good movie . I don't count " Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer . " It lacks a " 2 . " . . . Okay , well . . . Iron Man 2 kinda sucked . So , never mind .
161109139	1810582	Re : RE4's Controls Nearly Ruin the Game	Switching back to old controls can be tough sometimes , especially with something that's so specific about controls as RE4 . I remember playing it like a dream , then returning to it after playing MGS4 and getting my ass annihilated at every turn . I guess the problem is that you can't run-and-gun . This would actually be the evolution of this targeting system , which is why it feels so sluggish now . . . . I want another Dino Crisis game .

162627960	1810582	Re : so what does kryptonite actually do to superman ?	I don't know . I guess he could just as easily nuke it with laser-vision from a mile away .

The real kicker is that he doesn't blame anyone , he just doesn't understand . I have not yet seen the movie , because the preview was overbooked . . . damnit , but I think Avary may have stunted the potential that Silent Hill could have had , since he developed a screenplay too convuluted for the critics . . .

I think it's because most choices for Namor are the same as those for Black Adam . I really don't know who I'd pick for Namor . Maybe someone like Michael Fassbender .

70244170	1810582	Identitfying some weapons . . .	So , playing SC2 and then SC3 , I got to see some effed-up weapons showcased . Then going online , I found out . . . they were actually real ! Midnight ( Jian ) - I saw an African throwing sword that looks just like this one . I bleieve it was Sudani , called a " sakara . " Requim ( Seigfried ) , Soul Edge ( Cervantes ) - The design with the flat-head that spikes outward , that's also an African design developed in the Kingdom of Kongo . Full-Moon ( Voldo SC2 ) - Shaolin " Lun " , sharpened , without handle guard . Kora ( Lizardman ) - It can be found in India , as a sacrificial sword used for beheadings . A lot , and I mean " a lot , " of designs for weapons in the past decade have revolved around medeival African swords , which are undoubtedly " THE GNARLIEST WEAPONS TO SET EYES UPON ! " Even " Lord of the Rings , " Gimli's axes were of both Viking and African designs , it's awesome ! And the swords of the beserkers , they used the concept of the Kongo swords ! It's cool what you can find on the internet .

166716881	1810582	Second-Viewing : Time Skips , Plot Hole , Moments without talking , Murder .	I hate it less now . I think the acting of its three heroes destroys most of it , as well as the boring choreography , a lot of awful dialogue , underwhelming special effects , and a rushed romance . That's too much to ignore . I was able to overlook the rampant exposition this time , because it's not . . . terrible ? The problem is that we have no idea about this fantasy world's geography outside of a map that the characters keep unrolling in such a way that we can't clearly see it . I have some trouble accepting that the heroes will travel half-way around the world , North , and somehow the badguys can keep reporting on them in person to the Firelord . Otherwise , I can forgive some of the exposition . They add the words like " weeks " into scenes at the Northern Tribe , so it's entirely possible that Sokka and Yue get close ( more so , even , than the show ) . It's easier to accept that Aang's mastered Waterbending in this time . Zuko's " four days " of absence is a little distressing , since he traveled quite far , without a steam-powered ship , but it's not a " same day " occurrence . I found a plot hole . Zhao won't kill Aang because he'll just have to hunt for the next Avatar . What do characters know at this point ? - Aang is the last airbender - When an Avatar dies , another is born - The next Avatar will be a waterbender - The Avatar must master all four elements before becoming fully-realized - And . . . Aang is the last airbender Just kill him now ! The next Avatar wouldn't be a threat for a very long time , wouldn't be able to find an airbending teacher ( even if one was somehow just-born , in secret ) , and the Fire Nation seems to have a pretty good hold on the world at this point . If Ozai told him about Sozin's Comet , Zhao would've slit Aang's throat immediately ! I doubt a three-year old kid bending bubbles with his / her own spit would be able to stop the Fire Nation . The best moments , I find , are later scenes when people shut up and music plays . Noah Ringer actually looks competent with his choreography at the tail-end of the movie when summoning the water-wall ( he's pretty much " white-belt " material , otherwise ; and he bows awkwardly ) . I also respected the fact that the scene deviated from Aang channeling the Ocean Spirit almost out of revenge in the Season 1 Finale . It says a lot more ( especially without horrible vocal deliveries ) , when Aang demonstrates power and mercy , instead of becoming the Blue-Hulk and smashing ships . The scene where the Moon is revived is also very powerful without much dialogue ( especially after " believe in our beliefs " ) , and the color-play works beautifully . One thing I noticed more this time was how long it took to kill Zhao . The whole execution of this scene is redundant , dragging out something better and cheaper if left to the imagination . Why not simply cut away as soon as he gets slammed with those humongous tendrils of ice-water ? What ensues is a depiction of an unarmed , outnumbered man being drowned to death by warriors we were led to believe were noble , and it lasts longer than it should . We don't need to see him die , and they would've confirmed it anyway . I was disappointed with the cinematography being all " Zack Snyder " at times , especially when it was Andrew Lesnie , director of photography behind the Lord of the Rings . I wouldn't have minded someone who worked with Shyamalan before , like Eduardo Serra or Roger Deakins , because they'd probably have better input like : " 3-D will look terrible " and " These zoom-ins are the dumbest things ever . " To clarify here . . . this viewing was against my will . I had no real interest in re-watching , but upon the second-viewing decided I didn't exactly hate everything about it .

51817233	1810582	Sorry , I must say this . . .	I'm really tired of this tight-controller system . Lame . I'm a fan of Soul Calibur , so if you've played those , you'd know exactly why . For those who don't , let me explain . In SC there are two to three hit combos on every attack button , as well as crouching attacks that lead into rising attacks . It's a fluid system that I'd like to see done for MK . All MK is doing to one-up SC is Net-Play and the rip-off custom character ( Kharacter ) program . The least they could've done was amp up the controls to be more fluid . I mean , the advantage of MK is clear : they have real styles , from all over the world , giving them access to thousands of motions , as well the branching combo are killer ideas . Why not employ fluid gameplay with their research in martial arts ?

162451620	1810582	Re : Create a Character Games	Oh , hell , I love that game . You acquire customization items over time . Your first custom character may look crappy and you have to keep playing in specific styles to unlock new weapon styles and new archetypes . This could take forever if you don't really care to play Chronicles of the Sword ( which is the best way to unlock things ) . Chronicles of the Sword would be the campaign mode that strongly features customs and plays like an RTS and RPG , only it will periodically stop for you to fight enemies . That may sound clunky and weird . . . but I actually thought it was the best part of the whole game . Beat certain enemies ( boss-type characters mostly ) to unlock their equipment . Level up your characters to unlock styles . Purchase equipment in the shop , along with additional custom character spots ( 10 for each save in Chronicles , 10 for the regular game ) . There's also the story mode for the regular cast , which help you unlock their weapons . Training mode will help you unlock generic looking weapon types without any special abilities . Of course , if you just play versus with friends forever , you'll probably unlock everything eventually .

75512709	1810582	Sammo Hung's Soul Calibur	I didn't find out this information till now . God , I've been blind forever . Sammo Hung Set To Take Video Game To The Big Screen 10 April 2001 ( WENN ) Hong Kong action director and star Sammo Hung Kam-bo will be getting behind the camera to bring another video game to the big screen . Hung has been lined up to helm a $50 million ( 33million ) adaptation of Soul Calibur , the all-action beat-'em-up from video games company Namco . Hung , well known in Asia as an actor and director , is not as well-known stateside as his former schoolmate and occasional co-star , Jackie Chan , but had a modest success in the U . S . with his recent CBS television series Martial Law . Aged 49 this year , Hung made dozens of martial arts films before coming to prominence on the Hong Kong scene as a director and star with his 1978 martial arts film , Fay Lung Kwo Gong ( Enter the Fat Dragon ) . Soul Calibur , which should reach screens next year , is the latest in a spate of big-screen video-game conversions , which have included Street Fighter , Mortal Kombat and Super Mario Bros . It's been over 6 years , Sammo . When you gonna start ?

The Kraken looked terrible and I got less of a sense that you could actually appease it by feeding one person to it . This makes every human without a speaking role look incredibly retarded . You can't sympathize with such moronic bastards , and you don't feel their desperation . I could actually care about Hamlin surviving the movie . Medusa was more threatening as the clay-mation hag . The " beautifying " of her gorgon form made about as much sense as having her placed in the underworld . Her backstory was changed to rape , which does strike a better emotional chord than the original . However , I can't feel sympathy for something that shows complete emotional control and has been prettied up by CGI .

65306230	1810582	Classic ? . . . hah !	Sorry , I don't watch much Bollywood movies so I might seem a bit unlearned in this area . But . . . I didn't like this movie at all . The movies I usually tend to watch are Grindhouse Chinese Kung Fu movies with loads of martial arts violence and Blood Opera gunplay . Those movies are different from Bollywood movies , I guess ; but similarly , the two different national film styles aim for the same purpose : an amalgam of all genres into a single movie . They can be violent as hell and still have a dance number in the end . I watched this movie once and felt a little broken by everyone's praise of Bollywood cinema . . . I guess this wasn't their best , but it certainly is their most famous . I thought the characters were wooden and not a glint of human emotion is displayed by its lead until the very end , whilst the female counterpart spends the majority of her performance whipping her hair out of her face and spinning in the desert . I give much credit to the music in evoking any emotion that can be mustered in this cinematic mess . Another problem I have with this movie : They showcased Kalarippayattu in a disrespectful manner . No doubt it was always meant as a measure to kill an enemy , but the martial art is so much more than someone swinging an Urumi and lashing throats . They could've at least used it in a festive dance number to show just how beautiful the martial art can be . There's a moment at the end where a character , a kid , walks about talking in a non-chalant voice before it is revealed that he'd been struck by a score of arrows . . . I've seen this a thousand times , and it was NO shock to me at all that the child would die at the cost of another . To me , this is just a very bad Kung Fu movie , only it's not Kung Fu , made in India , and over budget . - Destructo _ dude Send me your hate mail .

166919934	1810582	Re : Nolan should COMBINE villains in this one	Black Hatter sounds cooler than Mad Mask .
162124973	1810582	Re : Cross overs ARE possible now . Link .	I don't think Nolan ever said that Batman can't connect with other heroes . I think he specifically stated that " his Batman " would never cross paths with other heroes . And as Shadowvoyd pointed out , he also wants the same for " his Superman . " So , the Nolan-trilogy of Batman films is off-limits in that regard , of course the company could just ignore what he said and do something of the article's nature anyway . I would like to see a transitional film that introduces Batman to the Justice League , because I think it's time someone addressed exactly how the dark knight would adjust to the change . He can't simply go from Earthly foes to fighting alien threats and sorcerers without changing his own outlook on priorities . The only time I think that shift was ever addressed was with the first episode of Justice League Unlimited , when Green Arrow has to adjust .
163086521	1810582	Re : Moena Baccarin as Wasp or Scarlet Witch ?	Wasp is Asian in the Ultimate universe . I blame Bryan Hitch .

I'd also contend that " Road to Perdition " and " Hellboy " ( off Seed of Destruction ) are better movies than comics . But , in the case of " Kick-Ass , " Matthew Vaughn has a much better idea about how to make characters likable and interesting instead of just a troop of hateful dicks , as Millar writes them . What's interesting is that Millar's best works are the ones where people don't drop eff-bombs or banter immature bullsh ! t .

You can't just pause and get what you want anymore . Other people complained about story , but that doesn't matter to me . " It's not scary enough , " so ? And what qualifies as " scary ?

164554129	1810582	Re : Most likely a live action adaptation of The Ultimates	I do agree . He claims to do things that are original , that have been done already by people better than him .

From the trailer I gathered that Nero got the hand because of something Dante triggered , but it may have even been caused by something internal . Nero could just be a half-breed like Dante whose demonic power finally found an outlet . Either way , he blames Dante and marks the possession of his hand at the day he met Dante . . . 2 and 2 . I hope Dante's darker and talks a lot less . The whole coin thing in # 2 seemed so much deeper than all the snide remarks in # 3 .

166259788	1810582	Re : In Defense of M . Night Shyamalan : Last Airbender and the . . .	Many naysayers of " The Last Airbender " are fans of the original animated series . They dislike changes made or the pace of the plot ( this time " too fast " instead of " too slow " ) . Exposition is played out mercilessly in this film . There's so much of it that we haven't begun to care that Katara's the only one in her village with superpowers . Admittedly , I dislike the animated series . I feel like I understand the symbolism of the elements in the show , but some of the seemingly random cultural elements and associations presented confuse and distract me . A lot of the time people check out during the first season , and miss out on the best episodes . In the cartoon , many characters don't notice . . . as if they see large flying-otter-mammoth-things every day . In the film , one of the characters actually has a WTF moment over the strange creature . I appreciated that enough to suspend my disbelief about the more fantastic elements of the story . Remember when Appa was captured because he was such a rare animal ? Oh , yeah , that was in Season 2 . With his cultural understanding of Eastern and Western worlds , Shyamalan has done a service to the original concept by presenting universally-understandable symbolism and themes . I don't know that this was ever the case . " Lady in the Water " is another frequently-trashed Night flick . When I hear someone trash-talking it , I find it to be a primary indication that the person is a ) not a writer ; b ) not a decent storyteller and c ) may lack comforting memories of fairy tales and childhood storytelling sessions . Monkeys pop out at the end and eat the Wolf made of grass . Then a Giant Eagle swoops off with Mermaid-Girl . We were warned this would happen earlier in the story . It's still pretty ridiculous . Bad things happen to movie critics in the film . If you can't interpret that symbolism ( in addition to the multiple layers of subtext in the film ) , you should probably go back to watching high-school potty humor movies made by Michael Bay . So , the only critics that matter are enthusiasts that appreciate everything they talk about . Symbolism in Lady in the Water was spelled out for us through the heroes ' quest . It's very immature of a writer to make such accusations . . . . Oh my God . Did she just compare Shyamalan to the Beatles ? What more obvious comparisons can we make next ? Can we start calling the critics Nazis ?

However , if they intended on doing so , there should have been an intermediary sequence to influence the alternative ending . In conclusion : watch the full version to feel depressed . Watch the edited version to feel arrogant . I don't own the West version . Are the extras good ?

160733255	1810582	Re : Anybody else feel that Iron Man has been permanently tainted ?	The way Millar seems to have intended on writing Civil War was for both sides to have a reason for doing what they did . Tony gets into " Days of Future Past " mode , only he's rounding up EVERYONE , recruits villains , and makes a homicidal , robot Thor . But , by the end of it , Tony's more clear-headed than Steve , who's about to strike a death-blow to Tony after bringing the big battle to New York City . I think Doctor Strange plays neutral because " both sides are right and wrong , " or something . Of course , I'm not surprised with how badly Iron Man has been presented outside of this central arc . He seems mostly redeemed in the Fraction run .

Matt Murdock , under a ton of speculation , is often categorized as an Irish-American . He has a connection with Catholicism , as well . If he were to undergo an ethnic change , it could change his whole identity . Spiderman never really had an ethnic identity , outside of a generic Anglo-American . But , then , what would be the defining feature of an Anglo-American identity ? Cowboy ancestors ?

Nifty little trick , that . . . makes the guy look like less of a pussy and more of a master tactician . Also , the tiger scenes cut outright . So are the beheadings of the admirals , and the complimentary set-up and wager between Tony and Takeshi ( sorry , I don't remember their character names right now , even if this is a famous story ) . Most , if not all , of the action is there .

30755803	1810582	Re : Has anyone tried making other VG characters ?	I thought about Cloud , then took another look . That hair-do everyone uses is better suited to Vergil from " Devil May Cry 3 " . Everyone ignores him though , as they'd rather be Dante . I attemped to make Dante from DMC2 , but found the dilemma of suiting him as a Barbarian or Knight . Both have access to Iron Swords , but Barbarian Dante gets Grieve-Edge resembling Beowulf from DMC3 , and Nightmare's Steel Paddle which resembles The Devastator ( ? ) Desolater ( ? ) Blade from DMC2 . With Knight Dante , Siegfried's weaponry is opened up , but it really doesn't mean anything if most of his moves are already duplicated in Iron Sword style . So , I gave up . My little bro made Snake from " Metal Gear Solid 3 , " and to my surprise it actually worked . I made Gordin Liu's character from " 36th Chamber of the Shaolin . " I've also attempted " V for Vendetta " * BEGIN SPOILERS * and decided it would be better suited if V was a woman , since the costume requires such utilities and considering the story's end , it would be fitting . * END SPOILERS * I stole a bunch of characters from " Brotherhood of the Wolf " since all of them are cool . Aside from duplicates , What I like to do is put the Barbarian Helmet ( a crocodile head ) on a woman and give her angel wings . That really screws with people's minds especially when I win .

51815976	1810582	Re : WHAT . . . . . IS UP . . . . WITH THIS GAMES AI ? ? ? ?	The difiicult thing about the AI is that it IS conquerable under such conditions , but only if you've mastered the switch-hits like ( b , A ) or ( k , B ) . It confuses the AI when you start a move , and anticipates within a millisecond , but eventually you fool the AI . Of course the characters with such attacks are limited as well many custom styles lack such power . . . . This is what I do in CotS . Sickle - ( A+B ) That's it . The AI can't adapt to this attack because it forces a guard break . It can be guard impacted , but such occasions are rare . So rare , they only occur with stage bosses and character cameos . You can even heal yourself if you've got Chains of Hades . I kept this move going against Night Terror on the mini-game matches and broke a record .

This is not to say Ellis ' original presentation wasn't lacking in the fascism . The problem with apologetic story arcs is that they make ruthless heroes into naive ones and pander toward the underlying political views of the writer .

78582689	1810582	Saw the first episode . . . mildly disappointed .	I wanted the Cowboy Bebop guys on this . Maybe it's the way I favor Jazz and Blues over all this New Wave sh ! t . The animation looks like it was invented only to see the characters pose , not move . Just like Hellsing , we're given a hero who just shoots things that can't shoot back , so I'm disappointed in that as well . It is the first episode so I will attempt to like future episodes . My only hope is that the show deviates from the game by having enemies who have guns . There's only been one so far . I'm guessing if this is canon it's set between Dante's Awakening and the first Devil May Cry . What I really want is a continuation off of Devil May Cry 2 , which I found to have the best cliffhanger of the series ( just my opinion : I thought part 2 rocked the hardest ) . I don't much care for Dante to have business partners , the dude and the girl , seems unnecessary since he can basically do it all by himself . Let alone the fact it's being done in hundreds of comics these days . If this Anime has anything to do with the Manga , I'll be pissed . I just hope it can do better than all this " I'm so conflicted and grim that I listen to Rock music " sh ! t . It's getting old quick after all the Manga , Anime , Comic Books , Movies , and whatever white-kids in black shirts buy these days .

162813549	1810582	Re : Anybody know what type of ' faults ' Lost Planet 2 has ?	I dread Stage 3-3 . Aside from the unfair turret placement , the game punishes you for every misstep by counting every fall as a suicide , even if you are shot off the side of the train . Sometimes , you're just sniping and OOPS you f _ ckin ' fell off the train . At least you start off with about 6 lives , and you're given the equivalent of a one-up at every checkpoint , but I really wish they would've also considered a point system for the battle-gauge ( since I'm aimlessly collecting these useless glowing orbs & boxes by instinct ) . I digress , though . It's a game made for multiplayer , which I really don't give a damn about . I can see a four person team , with one man in the engine room activating coolants , another two on top killing the bomber-akrids and projectiles , and one man on the big-ass cannon . I'm currently trudging my way through stage after stage , and I still am not really feeling these controls . I tend to strike my own teammates while activating these pylons . Enemy AI becomes obsessively selective toward my character above others . And the stealth aspect is nonexistent .

161801654	1810582	Orson Scott Card's Ultimate Iron Man . . .	I flipped through those two volumes a few times . . . wasn't as interested in them as say Ellis ' Ultimate Iron Man entries . Maybe it's because Card hates gays . What up with that ? . . . Seriously , though . I really found it hard to actually like Card's vision of Tony Stark being this living stem-cell that was painted blue throughout the origin story . It sounds interesting , and I'm sure it would be more interesting as something else . I get that it's a massive departure from the 616 continuity , but it shares nearly nothing in common other than the names and the power-suit . More-over , it kinda felt devoid of emotion , and if Tony can't die , I don't really give a damn about what happens next . But , if you liked it , I'd like to hear what you have to say .

That's why you won't see me over on the Dark Knight boards . Good . We don't even talk about the movie anymore . What would they have to be defensive about if they stayed over there or would have actually watched Iron Man 2 with an open mind ? You think we only watch one movie and bitch about everything else ? All the guys at TDK board kept out any comparison between these two movies . It's those rogue ass holes that instigate fights that are getting at you .

We could also add that Shaun Toub ( Persian ) , Cliff Curtis ( Maori ) , Aasif Mandvi and Dev Patel ( Indian ) are supposed to be related in this movie . And . . . it's not based on Anime . Its animation is . The story applies the Hindu notion of Avatars into the context of an alternate world , wherein Chinese martial arts and Comic Book superpowers connect .

Marduk was a lesser god of the Persian Pantheon , granted the powers of all the gods in order to destroy a great beast , known as Tiamet , the dragon patron of the ocean . This is also the case with Durga , an Indian goddess , created from the life-forces of all the gods of the Hindu Pantheon to destroy a great demon . All very interesting .

166785498	1810582	I'm going to complain more about Bending in this movie .	Animation is so immediate . Cartoon characters will do something and the cause and effect is seamless because they all exist in the same reality . So , naturally , the Avatar cartoon showcases martial arts movements that have a direct impact on an amazing feat . In this movie , most of the Bending was disjointed , unnatural , and appeared totally unrelated to the characters ' movements . This is probably because of the combination of live-action and computer-generated effects . My favorite complaint is about Aang throwing air that can target enemies that are blocked by allies . So , when he throws the stuntpeople attached to wires , it looks and feels unnatural because there were obstructions that didn't react at all to the special effect . It's like Smallville , when Clark makes that violent whoosh that doesn't seem to carry a breeze . Also , Aang seems to summon tornadoes without the need to maintain them with some additional motions or gestures . What also comes to mind is when bending is disregarded and replaced by telekinesis during the slow-motion , sideways tracking-shot , wherein Aang hardly does anything and still summons water . There's even a zoom-in where he just stares at a guy , who is immediately splashed . With Aang's form at the end , I hardly got the feel that he was using waterbending with the ocean . Some of his movements are spinning high-kicks that seem to have no real effect on the water-wall he summoned . A few of his movements did show that they were intending his performance to represent the push and pull of the tides in order to gather all that water into an enormous wave . The problem is , they made it more showy and less effective with the character's movements . A lot of his circular movements could have made violent whirlpools , etc . but they didn't seem altogether necessary for the giant wave . I will admit , earth - and firebending were presented with some level of immediate cause and effect ( caps-locks comments here about how unimpressive they were ) . I guess Air and Water are much harder to showcase because they're more fluid than the others . Aang doing a complex set of moves to knock down one guy in a market isn't as effective as say Zhao reaching toward a torch and throwing a fireball .

164375871	1810582	Re : I'm flabbergasted	I'm going by the concept that even Japanese animators have trouble making their Japanese characters look different . Most of the characters have the same faces in these cartoons in their respective genders , and are usually separated from looking like other characters by simple changes in hair style and color , and the color of their eyes . The skin-tone may also be altered to give off the impression that these characters are different . Bleach has this tendency to differentiate female characters by bust-size as well . I don't think citing the creators and cast as " non-Asian " helps your argument , and the reasons are too numerous and obvious .

The one thing about every review that I've noticed is that people assumed the soldier-vamps always ate their catches . The movie made it particularly clear that they were eating them because they'd become so desperate . That doesn't mean they always ate the humans they caught . They were probably efficient with their little taser-bullets before the drainage .

164075665	1810582	Re : Ghost in The Shell and The Matrix the same ? ( nm )	There are moments in the Dark Knight that make me wish he let Goyer write the script . And I hate Goyer's dialogue . But , his previous films ( without Goyer ) have been great , with interesting uses of dialogue . Insomnia has some effective moments of cinematography , so does Memento . Prestige is really impressive , though the great big plot device becomes altogether useless . Nolan's consistent failure has been female characters . The only one he succeeded with was Hillary Swank in Insomnia , primarily because it doesn't feel like he was writing a typically female character . . . . My criticisms are rooted in my appreciation of his work .

163774167	1810582	Re : Angelina Jolie as Catwoman , and Johny Depp as the Riddler	Everyone that has replied to me has said two things . - She should not be in a Batman movie because she's Angelina Jolie . - Catwoman is not just jack-off material . I think every claim that her persona will overtake her character is a bogus one . I also think she'd be able to pull of a dualistic character . And I think everyone is forgetting how much the character has evolved with the trends of fellow female superheroes rather than on her own . If you want to mention that she killed Black Mask on a bluff . . . I vaguely remember Wonder Woman doing something similar .

Taking that into account , you can overlook some of its problems developing its own plot or building the villain .

And the fact that we haven't seen their rivalry played out , I think , is a shame . Because I really want to see that story . To me there's nothing better than a really , really good rivalry against each other , and a revenge tale . It's all so , to me , gratifying . I wanted to utilize Scorpion , because he is arguably the most iconic of the Mortal Kombat franchise .

16710059	1810582	Re : Shadow kick ?	I think it's possible that a fantasy version of the famed kick was used because Fei-Hung's practices can't retain their accuracy today , and because of Wuxia film standards for wire-work . The move is also used in Tsui Hark's " Wong Fei-Hung " series , " Once Upon a Time in China . " Donnie Yen's character is the father of Wong Fei-Hung , therefore passing the technique to his son ; though it isn't used so much in part 3 . It kind of reminds me of " Johnny Cage " from " Mortal Kombat . " But that was Shadow Kick and this is Shadowless Kick .

163773374	1810582	Re : Smoking bans in Marvel	Sure they don't . And a company has every right to take cigarettes out of its comics . There's no problem with it , unless the cigarettes and cigars served some relatively important purpose within the context of the comic . Example : Wolverine stares down Nick Fury , uses Nick's cigar to light his own , and then drives away on a motorcycle , smoking . If they removed something like that from older comics , then it would be bad . But , they are simply banning smoking from here on in their comics . So , I see nothing wrong with it .

55159335	1810582	Cool Wuxia Fights ( I've seen )	Fist of Fury - Bruce Lee kills a bunch of Japanese stereotypes , a Russian , and two samurais wielding katanas . Drunken Master - Jackie Chan fights a tea-house staff , an iron-headed cheat , a king of bamboo , and the nefarious Thunder-leg using the martial art " Drunken Monkey . " Fearless Hyena - Jackie Chan uses " emotional " Wushu to fight a grandmaster who uses point striking . Jackie shifts from Joy to Sorrow to Anger and to Joy again . Masked Avengers - Nine minute finale wherein five ( ? ) heroes try to kill three ( ? ) trident wielding killers and a horde of minions . Oddly watchable for such length . Way of the Dragon - Bruce Lee versus Chuck Norris Fong Sai-Yuk 2 - Jet Li's katana belt Hero - A cliche , and I'm sorry ; Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung storm the Qin temple . SPL - Donnie Yen versus Jacky / Jing Wu with Kali and Fencing , gets cut to ribbons , then fights Sammo Hung with [ Japanese and Brazilian ] Jujitsu , Hapkido , and Western Boxing . I consider it one fight . Fist of the White Lotus - Gordin Liu fights Pai Mei after subduing his bodyguards . Once Upon a Time in China - Jet Li ( As Wong Fei-Hung ) fights Sifu Yim , who practices Iron Boxing , with Hung Gar and his fabled Shadowless kick . Once Upon a Time in China II - Jet Le fights the entire White Lotus Sect , defeats its champion and his guards , and has a pole fight with donnie yen that escalates to a " broken pole " form against " Cloth-stick " form , basically a wet-cloth whip that shatters bones .

162067083	1810582	Re : I was disappointed with God of War III	I was sad that they nixed the ram-attack button , especially since our futuristic age of 2010 demands that the right-stick shall henceforth be the camera . R1 should have just remained the ram-attack , so the dodge would be useless and reworked . I did not like fighting clone-army Zeus . But , in hindsight , I did not cycle through the different powers I had at my disposal to dispatch them . Was I supposed to use Helios ' severed head ?

162908775	1810582	Re : This is an absolute CRAP ! ! ! Interesting only for fanboys ! !	WAIT ! EVERYONE WAIT ! Okay . . . You might be on to something . A lot of it was predictable . Our hero's rival was insanely incompetent to NOT see what was painfully obvious about the villain . We're more giddy about the developments for upcoming movies than the actual film itself . And the film did follow a basic format of : " Sequel Tension , Self-Discovery , and Villain-Fight " that we got out of movies like Spiderman 2 . So . . . okay . . . you have a point . . . . I liked the movie .

Batman Begins just bleed with Nolan's writing . Blade II surpasses Trinity to a comsiderable margin . Did you hear del Toro talk about his heated argument over one of the cheesiest lines that Goyer fought to remain in the script ? On a side-note , All of del Toro's movies are like Frankenstein in nature , mostly dealing with family issues on adopted children . Blade II is a del Toro movie , all the ^ & % $ing way .

He used that and a lot of Golden Fleece attacks , especially against the Gorgon's stare .

Most of these pictures where people say he looks Asian shows him with Black , thin hair and his head leaned over to give the impression of the Asian brow-ridge . I still don't see it . It's hard to say who's Asian . Dean Cain's part Asian . Keanu Reeves is part Asian . For some reason most people call them " White . " But then you'd have to define " Asian " by leaving out Russians , Arabs , Persians , Indians and even the Berbers . Noah does not pass for Han Chinese , Korean , or Ethnic-Japanese .

I'm reading now ( on Wikipedia ) that it's about the formation of the school . I'm fine with that , at least they didn't forget there was a school in the comics and it served a pretty important purpose . Continuity-wise , if you said everything connected : - There are two Sabretooths . - Two Emma Frosts . - Scott Summers would be like ten years older than Jean Grey . - Storm grew up in Wakanda , moved to America and spontaneously lost her accent in her 30s .

We're getting a Green Lantern movie that will be the entryway for [ non-pink-skinned-humanoid ] aliens in comic movies . Sure , Thor will be cosmic , but it doesn't feature things that are clearly not-human ( maybe the Destroyer counts ) . There's a difference between having the Avengers fight , say , the Kree , and the X-men fighting the Shi'ar . The Avengers are a group of the finest heroes united to fight any threat . The X-men are a group composed amongst racial-allegory . For a movie , aliens might actually work for the Avengers . For the X-men . . . not so much . We've got so many sociological issues to deal with first that the Avengers aren't really concerned with ( aside of policing the world ) .

165204803	1810582	Re : The PRO-caster approach	Their ethnicities are more influenced than " set in stone . " There is no Asia to be established in the show or film's continuity . However , there are Asiatic features among different characters . A lot of the time , characters with slanted eyes will appear among characters with rounded eyes . Aang has huge eyes in comparison with Zuko . Is this race-related ? Or is it this way because big eyes are common among featured characters that the audience is asked to trust based on their " cute-ness " and naivety ? I never thought of Sokka and Katara as White or Inuit . Also . . . because Inuits don't look like that . . . at all , unless clothes count as superficial biological traits . I always figured they were Black and the wonky geography of the show would've allowed this to happen . Voice actors are not always assigned by their heritage , even though Mako , Lauren Tom , and Kim Mae Guest feature as " Asian " characters on the show ( and usually portray Asian characters in other shows ) . I don't know that you could call the Fire Nation " Indian " in the live-action adaptation , with the Persian Uncle and Maori father . But , it definitely calls into question the flexibility of race in the category that is somehow representing the most violent nation of people in the series .

Doyle died before the first season of Angel even ended . Then Glenn Quinn died of a drug addiction . 4 . It makes Xander more recognizable than if you called him Alex . Angelus is a former alias of Angel , not his real name . Wash hates his first name .
164434413	1810582	Re : A big reason that the movies will be more epic than the show	What about Batman ? Bruce Wayne's youth is largely skipped over from the point his parents are murdered to his time outside of Gotham as a fully-grown adult . It took decades to properly assess where Bruce Wayne was during these times , because it's not as necessary as when he travels the world as an adult before becoming Batman . The comparison you are looking for here is Robin . Robin's being trained by Batman with sort of a vendetta on his mind . He knows the name and face of the man that killed his parents and he has the skills necessary to act . Of course , even here , Robin has time to grow up and is represented in an immature fashion .

160609923	1810582	Re : My Dream X-Men Cast ( 1994 )	Alright , this is good . Angelina Jolie was only known for Cyborg 2 then , and Colin Farrell didn't even start acting . A few more did not fit in the 1994 timeline . - Ryan Phillippe - James Caviezel - Jeri Ryan ( mostly famous after Star Trek : Voyager ) I don't know if producers would have taken a chance on " that really intense guy from some Australian movie called ROMPER STOMPER , " but they did take a chance on Hugh Jackman . Angela Bassett makes a lot of sense for Storm . In all seriousness . . . 1994 . . . Gambit . . . HARRY CONNICK JR . From New Orleans , just starting out in movies , great charisma , and , hell , handsome as a devil . Cannot find a more perfect candidate for Gambit . Gary Oldman doesn't seem to match Magneto in the same way someone like Ian McKellan would . Surely Oldman isn't an elderly man , but he doesn't have the presence of a general . I have the same sort of feeling with Anthony Hopkins seeming more distant than fatherly . Actually , I would've picked Oldman for Mr . Sinister , but Jeremy Irons is a better choice . No problem with Nicole Kidman as Jean Grey . Looking at some of the changes now , and yeah , they're all about right for the era . Val Kilmer as the Angel sounds pretty good . However , Dolph as Omega Red would be a little too " Rocky 4 . " ( Off-hand : I have issues with Asian-Psylocke . ) Gong Li was famous for being in Zhang Yimou movies at this time , so I'm certain there would be some trouble with a casting director's reach of knowledge , especially when Ming-Na Wen is right there . Tia Carrere had also been made famous by the Wayne's World movies at this time , and would probably be the best choice for a featured Asian-female that had to walk about in revealing costumes . Anyway , thanks for clearing that all up . I had to edit what I typed earlier because I felt it was unfair .

If he kept attacking , he would've probably killed the very people responsible for releasing the mummy a few hours later . And why is the evil mummy given cosmic powers by the people that want him to suffer when they could just throw him into the pit of liquid-death ? Sure , it was to bar people from opening his tomb , but it's all just one big stupid gamble that didn't need to made in the first place .

The Last Airbender is compulsively faithful to the series - - to its lexicon and mythology , its boy-wizard spirit , and to everything it meticulously borrows from movies and books and graphic novels and anime and videogames . I get the feeling he looked at some pictures of the show and decided his long tenure would disguise the fact that he doesn't know what he's talking about , aside of the fact that things borrow from other things .
