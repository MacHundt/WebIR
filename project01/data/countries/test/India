25	 reference in literature sir arthur conan doyle in his first ever mystery novel astudy in scarlet has mentioned about the brief history of mormons. he has used the name of young without any changes and given the exact circumstance of their entering utah after abandoning their temple in present day illinois. in the novel he paints a very unflattering picture of mormons and a very cruel and harsh of brigham young. he has accused of mormons of running a covert organisation which ruthlessly eliminated any dissent from within by secretly kidnapping and probably assinating the rebels. though he describes him as a able leader and administrator. 
25	 in its modern sense calculus refers to several disciplines. most commonly it means the detailed analysis of rates of change in and is of utmost importance in all sciences. it is usually divided into two closely related branches: differential calculus and integral calculus.
 the first differential calculus is concerned with finding the instantaneous rate of change or derivative of a function's value with respect to changes in its argument roughly speaking how much the value of a function changes with a small change in its argument. this derivative can also be interpreted as the slope of the function's graph at a specific point.
 initially the derivative is defined via a process involving taking the limit of secant slopes as the two points defining the secant converge and the secant turns into a tangent line. this formula is called the difference quotient or newton quotient after isaac isaac newton who discovered calculus independently of but at the same time as gottfried wilhelm leibniz. the newton quotient is:
 fx lim ltugtfxh 
 where h is the distance between the two secant points.
 since immediately substituting  for h would lead to which cannot be computed the numerator must first be simplified until h can be factored out and then canceled against the h of the denominator. the resulting function is the derivative of the function it is the compilation of the instantaneous slopes at each point x.
 these messy limit calculations can be avoided however because of powerful differentiation rules which allow us to find derivatives easily using simple algebraic manipulations. see derivative for the details.
 at a maximal or minimal point these are collectively referred to as extrema a function's derivative must be zero and this yields a very useful optimization method. another application of differential calculus is newtons method an algorithm to find zeros of a function by approximating the function by its tangent.
 the second branch of calculus integral calculus studies methods for finding the integral of a function. an integral may be defined as the mathematical of a sum of terms which correspond to areas under the graph of a function. considered as such integration allows us to calculate the area under a curve and the surface area and volume of solids such as spheres and cones.
 the fundamental theorem of calculus states that derivatives and intergrals are inverse operations.
 this allows us to recover the total change in a function over some interval from its instantaneous rate of change by integrating the latter. the fundamental theorem also provides a method to compute many integrals algebraically without actually performing the limit process by finding it also allows us to solve some differential equations equations that relate an unknown function to its derivative. differential equations are ubiquitous in the sciences.
 the conceptual foundations of calculus include the function mathematical infinite sequences infinite series and continuity. its tools include the symbol manipulation techniques associated with elementary algebra and mathematical induction.
 calculus has been extended to differential equations vector calculus and differential topology.
 the modern formally correct version of calculus is known as real analysis.
 gottfried wilhelm leibniz and sir isaac newton independently invented differential and integral calculus in the late 1600s.
 newton who represented derivatives as f etc. provided a host of applications in physics but leibniz superior notation etc. was eventually adopted.
 the limit definiton of the derivative presented above was not evolved until much later and neither newton nor leibniz could develop calculus with acceptable rigour. nevertheless the calculus was widely used as it is a very powerful mathematical tool but it was not until the nineteenth centruy that mathematicians like augustin louis cauchy and bernhard bolzano were able to provide a mathematically rigorous exposition. this eventually resulted in deep explorations of the concept of infinity by georg cantor and others.
 derived from the latin word for pebble calculus in its most general sense can mean a method or system of calculation. other disciplines called calculus include:
 lambda calculus a formulation of the theory of computation
 predicate calculus the rules governing the logic of predicates in symbolic logic

navigation search for other uses see calculus disambiguation. partial fractions changing order calculus latin calculus a small stone used for counting is a discipline in mathematics focused on limits functions derivatives integrals and infinite series and which constitutes a major part of modern university education. it has two major branches calculus and integral calculus which are related by the fundamental theorem of calculus. calculus is the study of change in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of equations. a course in calculus is a gateway to other more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of functions and limits broadly called mathematical analysis. calculus has widespread applications in science economics and engineering and can solve many problems for which algebra alone is insufficient. historically calculus was called the calculus of infinitesimals or infinitesimal calculus. more generally calculus plural calculi may refer to any method or system of calculation guided by the symbolic manipulation of expressions. some examples of other well-known calculi are propositional calculus variational calculus lambda calculus pi calculus and join calculus. . limits and infinitesimals sir isaac newton is one of the most famous contributors to the development of calculus with among other things the use of calculus in his laws of motion and gravitation.main article: history of calculus the ancient period introduced some of the ideas of integral calculus but does not seem to have developed these ideas in a rigorous or systematic way. calculating volumes and areas the basic function of integral calculus can be traced back to the egyptian moscow papyrus c.  bc in which an egyptian successfully calculated the volume of a pyramidal frustum. from the school of greek mathematics eudoxus c.  bc used the method of exhaustion which prefigures the concept of the limit to calculate areas and volumes while archimedes c.  bc developed this idea further inventing heuristics which resemble integral calculus. the method of exhaustion was later used in china by liu hui in the rd century ad in order to find the area of a circle. in the 5th century ad zu chongzhi used what would later be called cavalieri's principle to find the volume of a sphere. around ad  the islamic mathematician ibn al-haytham alhacen was the first to derive the formula for the sum of the fourth powers of an arithmetic progression using a method that is readily generalizable to finding the formula for the sum of any higher integral powers which he used to perform an integration. in the 11th century the chinese polymath shen kuo developed packing equations that dealt with integration. in the 12th century the indian mathematician bhskara ii developed an early derivative representing infinitesimal change and he described an early form of rolle's theorem. also in the 12th century the persian mathematician sharaf al-dn al-ts discovered the derivative of cubic polynomials an important result in differential calculus. in the 14th century madhava of sangamagrama along with other mathematician-astronomers of the kerala school of astronomy and mathematics described special cases of taylor series which are treated in the text yuktibhasa. in the modern period independent discoveries relating to calculus were being made in early 17th century japan by mathematicians such as seki kowa who expanded upon the method of exhaustion. in europe the foundational work was a treatise due to bonaventura cavalieri who argued that volumes and areas should be computed as the sums of the volumes and areas of infinitesimal thin cross-sections. the ideas were similar to archimedes in the method but this treatise was lost until the early part of the twentieth century. cavalieri's work was not well respected since his methods can lead to erroneous results and the infinitesimal quantities he introduced were disreputable at first. the formal study of calculus combined cavalieri's infinitesimals with the calculus of finite differences developed in europe at around the same time. the combination was achieved by john wallis isaac barrow and james gregory the latter two proving the second fundamental theorem of calculus around . the product rule and chain rule the notion of higher derivatives taylor series and analytical functions were introduced by isaac newton in an idiosyncratic notation which he used to solve problems of mathematical physics. in his publications newton rephrased his ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time replacing calculations with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach. he used the methods of calculus to solve the problem of planetary motion the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid the oblateness of the earth the motion of a weight sliding on a cycloid and many other problems discussed in his principia mathematica. in other work he developed series expansions for functions including fractional and irrational powers and it was clear that he understood the principles of the taylor series. he did not publish all these discoveries and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered disreputable. gottfried wilhelm leibniz was originally accused of plagiarizing sir isaac newton's unpublished work but is now regarded as an independent inventor of and contributor to calculus.these ideas were systematized into a true calculus of infinitesimals by gottfried wilhelm leibniz who was originally accused of plagiarism by newton. he is now regarded as an independent inventor of and contributor to calculus. his contribution was to provide a clear set of rules for manipulating infinitesimal quantities allowing the computation of second and higher derivatives and providing the product rule and chain rule in their differential and integral forms. unlike newton leibniz paid a lot of attention to the formalism  he often spent days determining appropriate symbols for concepts. leibniz and newton are usually both credited with the invention of calculus. newton was the first to apply calculus to general physics and leibniz developed much of the notation used in calculus today. the basic insights that both newton and leibniz provided were the laws of differentiation and integration second and higher derivatives and the notion of an approximating polynomial series. by newton's time the fundamental theorem of calculus was known. when newton and leibniz first published their results there was great controversy over which mathematician and therefore which country deserved credit. newton derived his results first but leibniz published first. newton claimed leibniz stole ideas from his unpublished notes which newton had shared with a few members of the royal society. this controversy divided english-speaking mathematicians from continental mathematicians for many years to the detriment of english mathematics. a careful examination of the papers of leibniz and newton shows that they arrived at their results independently with leibniz starting first with integration and newton with differentiation. today both newton and leibniz are given credit for developing calculus independently. it is leibniz however who gave the new discipline its name. newton called his calculus the science of fluxions. since the time of leibniz and newton many mathematicians have contributed to the continuing development of calculus. in the 19th century calculus was put on a much more rigorous footing by mathematicians such as cauchy riemann and weierstrass see  definition of limit. it was also during this period that the ideas of calculus were generalized to euclidean space and the complex plane. lebesgue generalized the notion of the integral so that virtually any function has an integral while laurent schwartz extended differentiation in much the same way. calculus is a ubiquitous topic in most modern high schools and universities and mathematicians around the world continue to contribute to its development. while some of the ideas of calculus were developed earlier in greece china india iraq persia and japan the modern use of calculus began in europe during the 17th century when isaac newton and gottfried wilhelm leibniz built on the work of earlier mathematicians to introduce its basic principles. the development of calculus was built on earlier concepts of instantaneous motion and area underneath curves. applications of differential calculus include computations involving velocity and acceleration the slope of a curve and optimization. applications of integral calculus include computations involving area volume arc length center of mass work and pressure. more advanced applications include power series and fourier series. calculus can be used to compute the trajectory of a shuttle docking at a space station or the amount of snow in a driveway. calculus is also used to gain a more precise understanding of the nature of space time and motion. for centuries mathematicians and philosophers wrestled with paradoxes involving division by zero or sums of infinitely many numbers. these questions arise in the study of motion and area. the ancient greek philosopher zeno gave several famous examples of such paradoxes. calculus provides tools especially the limit and the infinite series which resolve the paradoxes. in mathematics foundations refers to the rigorous development of a subject from precise axioms and definitions. working out a rigorous foundation for calculus occupied mathematicians for much of the century following newton and leibniz and is still to some extent an active area of research today. there is more than one rigorous approach to the foundation of calculus. the usual one today is via the concept of limits defined on the continuum of real numbers. an alternative is nonstandard analysis in which the real number system is augmented with infinitesimal and infinite numbers as in the original newton-leibniz conception. the foundations of calculus are included in the field of real analysis which contains full definitions and proofs of the theorems of calculus as well as generalizations such as measure theory and distribution theory. edit limits and infinitesimals main articles: limit mathematics and infinitesimal calculus is usually developed by manipulating very small quantities. historically the first method of doing so was by infinitesimals. these are objects which can be treated like numbers but which are in some sense infinitely small. an infinitesimal number dx could be greater than  but less than any number in the sequence    and less than any positive real number. any integer multiple of an infinitesimal is still infinitely small i.e. infinitesimals do not satisfy the archimedean property. from this point of view calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating infinitesimals. this approach fell out of favor in the 19th century because it was difficult to make the notion of an infinitesimal precise. however the concept was revived in the 20th century with the introduction of non-standard analysis and smooth infinitesimal analysis which provided solid foundations for the manipulation of infinitesimals. in the 19th century infinitesimals were replaced by limits. limits describe the value of a function at a certain input in terms of its values at nearby input. they capture small-scale behavior just like infinitesimals but use the ordinary real number system. in this treatment calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating certain limits. infinitesimals get replaced by very small numbers and the infinitely small behavior of the function is found by taking the limiting behavior for smaller and smaller numbers. limits are easy to put on rigorous foundations and for this reason they are usually considered to be the standard approach to calculus. tangent line at x fx. the derivative fx of a curve at a point is the slope rise over run of the line tangent to that curve at that point.main article: differential calculus differential calculus is the study of the definition properties and applications of the derivative of a function. the process of finding the derivative is called differentiation. given a function and a point in the domain the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small-scale behavior of the function near that point. by finding the derivative of a function at every point in its domain it is possible to produce a new function called the derivative function or just the derivative of the original function. in mathematical jargon the derivative is a linear operator which inputs a function and outputs a second function. this is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra where functions usually input a number and output another number. for example if the doubling function is given the input three then it outputs six and if the squaring function is given the input three then it outputs nine. the derivative however can take the squaring function as an input. this means that the derivative takes all the information of the squaring functionsuch as that two is sent to four three is sent to nine four is sent to sixteen and so onand uses this information to produce another function. the function it produces turns out to be the doubling function. the most common symbol for a derivative is an apostrophe-like mark called prime. thus the derivative of the function of f is f pronounced f prime. for instance if fx  x is the squaring function then fx  x is the doubling function. if the input of the function represents time then the derivative represents change with respect to time. for example if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time that is it is the velocity of the ball. if a function is linear that is if the graph of the function is a straight line then the function can be written y  mx  b where: this gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line. if the graph of the function is not a straight line however then the change in y divided by the change in x varies. derivatives give an exact meaning to the notion of change in output with respect to change in input. to be concrete let f be a function and fix a point a in the domain of f. a fa is a point on the graph of the function. if h is a number close to zero then a  h is a number close to a. therefore a  h fa  h is close to a fa. the slope between these two points is this expression is called a difference quotient. a line through two points on a curve is called a secant line so m is the slope of the secant line between a fa and a  h fa  h. the secant line is only an approximation to the behavior of the function at the point a because it does not account for what happens between a and a  h. it is not possible to discover the behavior at a by setting h to zero because this would require dividing by zero which is impossible. the derivative is defined by taking the limit as h tends to zero meaning that it considers the behavior of f for all small values of h and extracts a consistent value for the case when h equals zero: geometrically the derivative is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at a. the tangent line is a limit of secant lines just as the derivative is a limit of difference quotients. for this reason the derivative is sometimes called the slope of the function f. here is a particular example the derivative of the squaring function at the input . let fx  x be the squaring function. the derivative fx of a curve at a point is the slope of the line tangent to that curve at that point. this slope is determined by considering the limiting value of the slopes of secant lines. here the function involved drawn in red is fx  x  x. the tangent line in green which passes through the point has a slope of note that the vertical and horizontal scales in this image are different. the slope of tangent line to the squaring function at the point  is  that is to say it is going up six times as fast as it is going to the right. the limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. this defines the derivative function of the squaring function or just the derivative of the squaring function for short. a similar computation to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function. main article: leibniz's notation a common notation introduced by leibniz for the derivative in the example above is in an approach based on limits the symbol is to be interpreted not as the quotient of two numbers but as a shorthand for the limit computed above. leibniz however did intend it to represent the quotient of two infinitesimally small numbers dy being the infinitesimally small change in y caused by an infinitesimally small change dx applied to x. we can also think of as a differentiation operator which takes a function as an input and gives another function the derivative as the output. for example: in this usage the dx in the denominator is read as with respect to x. even when calculus is developed using limits rather than infinitesimals it is common to manipulate symbols like dx and dy as if they were real numbers although it is possible to avoid such manipulations they are sometimes notationally convenient in expressing operations such as the total derivative. integral calculus is the study of the definitions properties and applications of two related concepts the indefinite integral and the definite integral. the process of finding the value of an integral is called integration. in technical language integral calculus studies two related linear operators. the indefinite integral is the antiderivative the inverse operation to the derivative. f is an indefinite integral of f when f is a derivative of f. this use of upper and lower-case letters for a function and its indefinite integral is common in calculus. the definite integral inputs a function and outputs a number which gives the area between the graph of the input and the x-axis. the technical definition of the definite integral is the limit of a sum of areas of rectangles called a riemann sum. a motivating example is the distances traveled in a given time. if the speed is constant only multiplication is needed but if the speed changes then we need a more powerful method of finding the distance. one such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval and then taking the sum a riemann sum of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. the basic idea is that if only a short time elapses then the speed will stay more or less the same. however a riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled. we must take the limit of all such riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled. integration can be thought of as measuring the area under a curve defined by fx between two points here a and b.if fx in the diagram on the left represents speed as it varies over time the distance traveled between the times represented by a and b is the area of the shaded region s. to approximate that area an intuitive method would be to divide up the distance between a and b into a number of equal segments the length of each segment represented by the symbol x. for each small segment we can choose one value of the function fx. call that value h. then the area of the rectangle with base x and height h gives the distance time x multiplied by speed h traveled in that segment. associated with each segment is the average value of the function above it fxh. the sum of all such rectangles gives an approximation of the area between the axis and the curve which is an approximation of the total distance traveled. a smaller value for x will give more rectangles and in most cases a better approximation but for an exact answer we need to take a limit as x approaches zero. the symbol of integration is  an elongated s the s stands for sum. the definite integral is written as: and is read the integral from a to b of f-of-x with respect to x. the leibniz notation dx is intended to suggest dividing the area under the curve into an infinite number of rectangles so that their width x becomes the infinitesimally small dx. in a formulation of the calculus based on limits the notation is to be understood as an operator that takes a function as an input and gives a number the area as an output dx is not a number and is not being multiplied by fx. the indefinite integral or antiderivative is written: functions differing by only a constant have the same derivative and therefore the antiderivative of a given function is actually a family of functions differing only by a constant. since the derivative of the function y  x  c where c is any constant is y  x the antiderivative of the latter is given by: an undetermined constant like c in the antiderivative is known as a constant of integration. main article: fundamental theorem of calculus the fundamental theorem of calculus states that differentiation and integration are inverse operations. more precisely it relates the values of antiderivatives to definite integrals. because it is usually easier to compute an antiderivative than to apply the definition of a definite integral the fundamental theorem of calculus provides a practical way of computing definite integrals. it can also be interpreted as a precise statement of the fact that differentiation is the inverse of integration. the fundamental theorem of calculus states: if a function f is continuous on the interval a b and if f is a function whose derivative is f on the interval a b then furthermore for every x in the interval a b this realization made by both newton and leibniz who based their results on earlier work by isaac barrow was key to the massive proliferation of analytic results after their work became known. the fundamental theorem provides an algebraic method of computing many definite integralswithout performing limit processesby finding formulas for antiderivatives. it is also a prototype solution of a differential equation. differential equations relate an unknown function to its derivatives and are ubiquitous in the sciences. physics makes particular use of calculus all concepts in classical mechanics are interrelated through calculus. the mass of an object of known density the moment of inertia of objects as well as the total energy of an object within a conservative field can be found by the use of calculus. in the subfields of electricity and magnetism calculus can be used to find the total flux of electromagnetic fields. a more historical example of the use of calculus in physics is newton's second law of motion it expressly uses the term rate of change which refers to the derivative: the rate of change of momentum of a body is equal to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction. even the common expression of newton's second law as force  mass  acceleration involves differential calculus because acceleration can be expressed as the derivative of velocity. maxwell's theory of electromagnetism and einstein's theory of general relativity are also expressed in the language of differential calculus. chemistry also uses calculus in determining reaction rates and radioactive decay. calculus can be used in conjunction with other mathematical disciplines. for example it can be used with linear algebra to find the best fit linear approximation for a set of points in a domain. or it can be used in probability theory to determine the probability of a continuous random variable from an assumed density function. green's theorem which gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed curve c and a double integral over the plane region d bounded by c is applied in an instrument known as a planimeter which is used to calculate the area of a flat surface on a drawing. for example it can be used to calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped flower bed or swimming pool when designing the layout of a piece of property. in the realm of medicine calculus can be used to find the optimal branching angle of a blood vessel so as to maximize flow. in analytic geometry the study of graphs of functions calculus is used to find high points and low points maxima and minima slope concavity and inflection points. in economics calculus allows for the determination of maximal profit by providing a way to easily calculate both marginal cost and marginal revenue. calculus can be used to find approximate solutions to equations in methods such as newton's method fixed point iteration and linear approximation. for instance spacecraft use a variation of the euler method to approximate curved courses within zero gravity environments. find more about calculus on wikipedia's sister projects:

25	a case for the origin of chess in the indian plains? chatur anga in sanskrit which got translated to shatarang and ultimately chess basically means four arms. four arms of the army. since antiquityas mentioned in mahabarata or even much-much later when alexander the great reached india elephants were tamed and used for warfare in india. vast hard battle plainsunlike deserts or glades ment chariots would be of immense strategic importance. mounted horses too would be used. and of course infantry has its place in any battle plan except perhaps for the mongols. if the higher chess pieces do indeed represent the elephantrook the chariotbishop and the cavalryhorse in the order of their effectiveness then nations which never employed elephants or chariots or cavalry or infantry stand eliminated as the inventor of chess. in which case there does not seem to be much of debate over where chess originated from. 
25	chess originated in india during the gupta empire where its early form in the 6th century was known as caturaga which translates as four divisions of the military  infantry cavalry elephants and chariotry represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn knight bishop and rook respectively. both the persians and arabs attribute the game of chess to the indians. in sassanid persia around  the name became shatranj and the rules were developed further. shatranj was taken up by the muslim world after the islamic conquest of persia with the pieces largely retaining their persian names. in spanish shatranj was rendered as ajedrez in portuguese as xadrez and in greek as zatrikion but in the rest of europe it was replaced by versions of the persian shh king which was familiar as an exclamation and became our words check and chess. murray theorized that this change happened from muslim traders coming to european seaports with ornamental chess kings as curios before they brought the game of chess. knights templar playing chess libro de los juegos .the game reached western europe and russia by at least three routes the earliest being in the 9th century. by the year  it had spread throughout europe. introduced into the iberian peninsula by the moors in the 10th century it was described in a famous 13th-century manuscript covering shatranj backgammon and dice named the libro de los juegos. another theory contends that chess arose from the game xiangqi chinese chess or one of its predecessors.

the age  with the arrival of wisdom teeth the homosexuality devils start functioning and due to various factors like the respect towards false priest or evangelist frequency of worship etc sexual

serpents or sinner or perversed. see page . the rest of the gospel authors did not mention it even though their feet had also been washed of mathew and mark because they tried to hide the proof that jesus is serpent. also most of the apostles were either unmarried or left wives and children. even to day majority of the christian evangelists are celibates which corroborates the fact that jesus is homosexuality blessor. another fact is that in gospel gabriel tells jesus as to be son of heavenly father while in quran he tells jesus to be prophet which it self is sufficient for sensible people to leave jesus or doubt his credibility. another fact is that any sexual intercourse between male and female without gods dream permission is adultery and eating of fruit of tree of the knowledge of good

25	eye contact and writing. communication is a process of transferring information from one entity to another. communication processes are sign-mediated interactions between at least two agents which share a repertoire of signs and semiotic rules. communication is commonly defined as the imparting or interchange of thoughts opinions or information by speech writing or signs. although there is such a thing as one-way communication communication can be perceived better as a two-way process in which there is an exchange and progression of thoughts feelings or ideas energy towards a mutually accepted goal or direction information. communication is a process whereby information is enclosed in a package and is channeled and imparted by a sender to a receiver via some medium. the receiver then decodes the message and gives the sender a feedback. all forms of communication require a sender a message and a receiver. communication requires that all parties have an area of communicative commonality. there are auditory means such as speech song and tone of voice and there are nonverbal means such as body language sign language paralanguage touch 
25	shannon and weaver model of communication communication major dimensions scheme interactional model of communication berlo's sender-message-channel-receiver model of communication transactional model of communication the first major model for communication came in by claude shannon and warren weaver for bell laboratories  the original model was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technologies. their initial model consisted of three primary parts: sender channel and receiver. the sender was the part of a telephone a person spoke into the channel was the telephone itself and the receiver was the part of the phone where one could hear the other person. shannon and weaver also recognized that often there is static that interferes with one listening to a telephone conversation which they deemed noise. in a simple model often referred to as the transmission model or standard view of communication information or content e.g. a message in natural language is sent in some form as spoken language from an encoder to a decoder. this common conception of communication simply views communication as a means of sending and receiving information. the strengths of this model are simplicity generality and quantifiability. social scientists claude shannon and warren weaver structured this model based on the following elements: an information source which produces a message. a transmitter which encodes the message into signals a channel to which signals are adapted for transmission a receiver which decodes reconstructs the message from the signal. a destination where the message arrives. shannon and weaver argued that there were three levels of problems for communication within this theory. the technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted? the semantic problem: how precisely is the meaning conveyed? the effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior? critiques by stating: it assumes communicators are isolated individuals. no allowance for differing purposes. no allowance for differing interpretations. no allowance for unequal power relations. no allowance for situational contexts. in  david berlo expanded on shannon and weavers  linear model of communication and created the smcr model of communication. the sender message-channel-receiver model of communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars. communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: message what type of things are communicated source emisor sender encoder by whom form in which form channel through which medium destination receiver target decoder to whom and receiver. wilbur schram  also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has both desired and undesired on the target of the message. between parties communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences give advice and commands and ask questions. these acts may take many forms in one of the various manners of communication. the form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. together communication content and form make messages that are sent towards a destination. the target can be oneself another person or being another entity such as a corporation or group of beings. communication can be seen as processes of information transmission governed by three levels of semiotic rules: syntactic formal properties of signs and symbols pragmatic concerned with the relations between and their users and semantic study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent. therefore communication is social interaction where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of semiotic rules. this commonly held rules in some sense ignores autocommunication including intrapersonal communication via diaries or self-talk both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions. in light of these weaknesses barnlund  proposed a transactional model of communication. the basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages. in a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked reciprocally. this second attitude of communication referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. communication is viewed as a conduit a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. a particular instance of communication is called a speech act. the sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions cultures or gender which may alter the intended meaning of message contents. in the presence of communication noise on the transmission channel air in this case reception and decoding of content may be faulty and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. one problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a codebook and that these two code books are at the very least similar if not identical. although something like code books is implied by the model they are nowhere represented in the model which creates many conceptual difficulties. theories of coregulation describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process rather than a discrete exchange of information. canadian media scholar harold innis had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society wark mckenzie . his famous example of this is using ancient egypt and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. papyrus is what he called space binding. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. the other is stone and time binding through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation through this media they can change and shape communication in their society wark mckenzie . bernard luskin ucla  advanced computer assisted instruction and began to connect media and psychology into what is now the field of media psychology. in  the american association of psychology media psychology division  task force report on psychology and new technologies combined media and communication as pictures graphics and sound increasingly dominate modern communication. in any communication model noise is interference with the decoding of messages sent over a channel by an encoder. there are many examples of noise: environmental noise: noise that physically disrupts communication such as standing next to loud speakers at a party or the noise from a construction site next to a classroom making it difficult to hear the professor. physiological-impairment noise: physical maladies that prevent effective communication such as actual deafness or blindness preventing messages from being received as they were intended. semantic noise: different interpretations of the meanings of certain words. for example the word weed can be interpreted as an undesirable plant in your yard or as a euphemism for marijuana. syntactical noise: mistakes in grammar can disrupt communication such as abrupt changes in verb tense during a sentence. organizational noise: poorly structured communication can prevent the receiver from accurate interpretation. for example unclear and badly stated directions can make the receiver even more lost. cultural noise: stereotypical assumptions can cause misunderstandings such as unintentionally offending a non-christian person by wishing them a merry christmas. psychological noise: certain attitudes can also make communication difficult. for instance great anger or sadness may cause someone to lose focus on the present moment. disorders such as autism may also severely hamper effective communication. communication as academic discipline main article: communication theory communication as an academic discipline sometimes called communicology relates to all the ways we communicate so it embraces a large body of study and knowledge. the communication discipline includes both verbal and nonverbal messages. a body of scholarship all about communication is presented and explained in textbooks electronic publications and academic journals. in the journals researchers report the results of studies that are the basis for an ever-expanding understanding of how we all communicate. communication happens at many levels even for one single action in many different ways and for most beings as well as certain machines. several if not all fields of study dedicate a portion of attention to communication so when speaking about communication it is very important to be sure about what aspects of communication one is speaking about. definitions of communication range widely some recognizing that animals can communicate with each other as well as human beings and some are more narrow only including human beings within the different parameters of human symbolic interaction. communication in interpersonal relationships  mehrabian albert . silent

25	four main kinds of distractions act as physical barriers to the communication process.these are:  the competing stimulus: in the form of another conversation going on within hearing distance or loud music or traffic noise in the background.  environmental stress: a high temperature and humidity poor ventilation vibrations felt a strong glare all. can contribute to distortions in the sending and receiving of messages.  subjective stress: sleeplessness ill health the effects of drugs and mood variations give rise to forms of subjective stress that often lead to great difficulties in listening and interpretation.  ignorance of the medium: the various media for communication are: oral written audio visual and audiovisual. the use of a medium with which the communicators are not familiar would turn the medium itself into a barrier.lt 
25	semantics semantics is the branch of linguistics dealing with the meaning of words and sentences. semantic concerned with problems and obstructions in the process of encoding and decoding of message into words or impressions. normally such barriers result on account of use of wrong words faulty translations different interpretations etc. these are discussed below: ibadly expressed message: sometimes intended meaning may not be conveyed by a manager to his subordinates. these badly expressed messages may be an account of inadequate vocabulary usage of wrong words omission of needed words etc. iisymbols with different meanings: a word may have several meanings. receiver has to perceive one such meaning for the word used by communicator. for example consider these three sentences where the work value is used: awhat is the value of this ring? bi value our friendship. cwhat is the value of learning you will find that the valuegives different meaning indifferent contexts. wrong perception leads to communication problems. iiifaulty translations: sometimes the communications originally drafted in one language e.g.english need to be translated to the language understandable to workers e.g. hindi. if the translator is not proficient with both the languages mistakes may creep in causing different meanings to the communication.iviv ivunclarified assumptions:some communications may have certain assumptions which are subject to different interpretations. vtechnical jargon: it is usually found that specialists use technical jargon while explaining to persons who are not specialists in the concerned field. therefore they may not understand the actual meaning of many such words. psychological barriers. emotional or psychological factors acts as barriers to communicators. for example a worried person cannot communicate properly and an angry receiver cannot understand the real meaning of message. the state of mind of both sender and receiver of communication reflects in the effective communication. some of the psychological barriers are: ipremature evaluation: some times people evaluate the meaning of message before the sender completes his message. such premature evaluation may be preconceived notions or prejudices against communication. ii lack attention: preoccupied mind of receiver and the resultant non-listening of message acts as a major psychological barrier. for instance employee explains about his problems to the boss who is pre-occupied with an important file before him. the boss does not grasp the message and the employee is disappointed. iiiloss by transmission and poor retention: when communication passes through various levels successive transmissions the message results in loss of or transmission of inaccurate information. more so in case of oral communication. poor retention is another problem. usually people cannot retain information for a long time they inattentive not interested. iv distrust: distrust between communicator and communicate acts as a barrier. if the parties do not believe each other they can not understand each others message in its original sense. organisational barriers.the factors related organisation structure authority relationships rules and regulations sometimes act as barriers effective communication. some of these barriers are: iorganisational policy: if the organisational policy explicit or implicit is not supportive to free flow of communication it may hamper effectiveness of communications. for examplein an organisation with highly centralised pattern people may not be encouraged to have free communication. iirules and regulations: rigid rules and cumbersome procedures may be a hurdle to communication. similarly communications through prescribed channel may result in delays. iiistatus: status of superior may create psychological distance between him and his subordinates. a status conscious manager may not allow his subordinates to express their feelings freely. ivcomplexity in organisation structure: in an organisation where there number of managerial levels gets delayed and distorted as number of filtering points are more. vorganisational facilities: if facilities smooth clear and timely communications are not provided communications may be hampered. facilities like frequent meetings suggestion box complaint box social and cultural gathering transparency in operations etc. will encourage free flow of communication. lack of these facilities may create communication problems. personal barriers.the personal factors of both sender and receiver may exert influence on effective communication. some of the personal barriers of superiors and subordinates are mentioned below: ifear of challenge to authority: if a superior perceives that a particular communication may adversely affect his authority he or she may withhold or suppress such communication. lack of confidence of superior on his subordinates: if superiors do not have confidence on the competency of their subordinates they may not seek their advice or opinions. iii unwillingness to communicate: sometimes subordinates may not be prepared to communicate with their superiors if they perceive that it may adversely affect their interests. iv lack of proper incentives: if there is no motivation or incentive for communication subordinates may not take initiative to communicate. for example if there is no reward or appreciation for a good suggestion the subordinates may not be willing to offer useful

25	cytoplasm is basically the substance that fills the cell. it is a jelly-like material that is eighty percent water and usually clear in color. it is more like a viscous thick gel than a watery substance but it liquefies when shaken or stirred. cytoplasm which can also be referred to as cytosol means cell substance. this name is very fitting because cytoplasm is the substance of life that serves as a molecular soup in which all of the cell's organelles are suspended and held together by a fatty membrane. the cytoplasm is found inside the cell membrane surrounding the nuclear envelope and the cytoplasmic organelles. the cytoplasm as seen through an electron microscope appears as a three dimensional lattice of thin protein-rich strands. these lattices are known as microtrabecular lattice mtl and serves to interconnect and support the other solid structures in the cytoplasm. in other words the cytoplasm is like a fence that is made up of lattes that are connected together. this fence's main purpose is to hold together the organelles within the cytoplasm. cytoplasm is the home of the cytoskeleton a network of cytoplasmic filaments that are responsible for the movement of the cell and give the cell its shape. the cytoplasm contains dissolved nutrients and helps dissolve waste products. the cytoplasm helps materials move around the cell by moving and churning through a process called cytoplasmic streaming. the nucleus often flows with the cytoplasm changing the shape as it moves. the cytoplasm contains many salts and is an excellent conductor of electricity which therefore creates a medium for the vesicles or mechanics of the cell. the function of the cytoplasm and the organelles which sit in it are critical the cell's survival.

wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to: navigation search ecosystem models or ecological models are mathematical representations of ecosystems. typically they simplify complex foodwebs down to their major components or trophic levels and quantify these as either numbers of organisms biomass or the of some pertinent chemical element for instance carbon or a nutrient such as nitrogen phosphorus. ecosystem models are a development theoretical ecology that aim characterise major dynamics of both to synthesise the understanding such systems and to allow predictions of their behaviour in general terms or in response to particular changes. because complexity of in terms of numbers of interactions ecosystem models typically simplify the systems they are studying to a limited number of pragmatic components. particular species of interest or may be broad functional types such as autotrophs heterotrophs or saprotrophs. in biogeochemistry ecosystem models usually include representations of non-living resources such as nutrients which are consumed by and may be depleted by living components of the model. this simplification is driven by a number of factors:  ignorance: while understood in broad outline the details of a particular foodweb may not be known this applies both to identifying relevant species and to the functional responses linking them which are often extremely difficult to quantify  computation: practical constraints on simulating large numbers of ecological elements this is particularly true when ecosystem models are embedded within other spatially-resolved models such as physical models of terrain or ocean bodies or idealised models such as cellular automata or coupled map lattices  understanding: depending upon the nature of the study complexity can confound the analysis of an ecosystem model the interacting components a model has the less straightforward it is extract and separate causes and consequences this is compounded when uncertainty about components obscures the accuracy of a simulation the process of simplification described above typically reduces an ecosystem to a small number of state variables. depending upon the system under study these may represent ecological components in terms of numbers of discrete individuals or quantify the component more continuously as a measure of the total biomass of all organisms of that type often using a common model currency e.g. mass of carbon per unit the components are then linked together by mathematical functions that describe the of the relationships between them. for instance in models which include predator-prey relationships the two components are usually linked by some function relates total prey captured to the populations of both predators and prey. deriving these relationships is often extremely difficult given habitat heterogeneity the details of component behavioral ecology including issues such as perception foraging behaviour and the difficulties involved in unobtrusively studying these relationships under field conditions. typically relationships are derived statistically or heuristically. for example some standard functional forms describing these relationships are linear quadratic hyperbolic or sigmoid functions. the latter two are known in ecology as type ii and type iii responses named by c. s. holling in early groundbreaking work predation in mammals. both describe relationships in which a linkage between components saturates at some maximum rate e.g. above a certain concentration prey organisms predators cannot catch any more per unit time. some interactions are derived explicitly from the biochemical processes that underlie them for instance nutrient processing by an organism may saturate because of either a limited number of binding sites on the organism's exterior surface or the rate of diffusion of nutrient across the boundary layer surrounding the organism see also michaelis-menten kinetics. after establishing the components to modelled and the relationships between them another important factor in ecosystem model structure is the representation of space used. historically models have often ignored the confounding issue of space utilising zero-dimensional approaches such as ordinary differential equations. with increases in computational power models which incorporate space are increasingly e.g. partial differential equations cellular automata. inclusion space permits dynamics not present non-spatial frameworks illuminates processes that lead pattern formation systems 
25	biosphere is an example of ecosystem. it is necessary to understand different aspects of ecosystem e.g. meaning characteristics types stability and instability before dealing with different aspects and characteristics of biospheric ecosystem the term ecosystem was first used by a.g. tansely in  who defined ecosystem as a particular category of physical systems consisting of organisms and inorganic components in a relatively stable equilibrium open and of various sizes and kinds. according to ecosystem is comprised of two major parts viz. biome  whole complex plants and animals a particular spatial unit and habitat  physical environ-ment and thus all parts of such an ecosystem-organic and in-organic biome and habitat-may be regarded as interacting factors which in a mature ecosystem are in approximate equilibrium it is through interactions that is maintaineda. g. tansley f. r. fosberg  has defined ecosystem as a functioning interacting system composed of one or more living organisms and their effective environment both physical and biological. according to r. l. linderman  the term ecosystem applies to any system composed of physical-chemical-biological processes with a space-time unit of any magnitude. in e. p. odums view   living organisms and their non-living abiotic environment are inseparably interrelated and interact upon each other. any unit that includes all of the organisms i.e. the community in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure biotic diversity and material cycle i.e. exchange of material between living and non-living parts with the systemin an ecological system or ecosystem. in a more lucid style and simple term an ecosystem may be defined as a fundamental functional unit occupying spatial dimension of earth space ship characterized by total assemblage of biotic community and abiotic components and their mutual interactions within a given time unit.  savindra singh . the following are the basic properties of an ecosystem--- i ecosystem of any given space-time-unit represents the sum total of all living organisms and physical environment. ii it is composed of three basic components viz. energy biotic biome and abiotic habitat components. iii it occupies certain well defined area on the earth-space ship spatial dimensions. iv it is viewed in terms of time-unit temporal dimension. v there are complex sets of interactions between biotic and abiotic components energy components on one hand and between and among the organisms on the other hand. vi it is open system which is characterized by continuous input and output of matter and energy. vii it is powered by energy of various sorts solar energy is most significant. viii it tends to be relatively stable equilibrium unless there is disturbance in one or more controlling factors limiting factors. ix ecosystems are natural resource systems x it is structured and well organized system. xi there is different sequence of ecosystem development. the sequence of ecosystem development in terms of particular suite of physical and chemical conditions is called as sere. a sere represents the development of a series of sequential successions starting from primary succession and culminating into the last succession in a sere as climax or climatic climax which is the most stable situation of an ecosystem. thus the study of ecosystem development may help in environmen-tal planning from ecological point of view. ecosystem may be classified and claimed on various bases with different purpose and objective as outlined below- . on the basis of habitat-the habitats exhibit the physical environmental conditions of a particular spatial unit of the biosphere. these physical conditions determine the nature and characteristics of biotic communities and therefore there are spatial variations in the biotic communities. based on this premise the world ecosystem are divided into two major categories viz. a terrestrial ecosystems and b aquatic ecosystems. there are further variations in the terrestrial ecosystems in terms of physical conditions and their response to biotic communities. therefore the terrestrial ecosystems are further divided into sub-categories of i upland or mountain ecosystems ii lowland ecosystems iii warm desert ecosystems and iv cold desert ecosystems. these sub-ecosystems may be further divided into descending orders depending on specific purposes and objective of studies. b the aquatic ecosystems are subdivided into two broad categories i freshwater on continents ecosystem ii marine ecosystem. . on the basis of spatial scale-ecosystems are divide into different types on various orders on the basis of spatial dimensions required for specific purposes. the largest ecosystem is biosphere which is subdivided into two major types a continental ecosystem and b oceanic or marine ecosystems. the spatial scales may be brought down from a continent to a single biotic life plants or animals. the basis issues-e.  has divided the world ecosystem on the basis of harvest methods and net primary production into two broad categories viz. a cultivated ecosystem and b non-cultivated ecosystems. cultivated ecosystems may be subdivided into several categories on the basis of cultivation of dominant crops e.g. wheat field ecosystem rice field ecosystem sugarcane field ecosystem fodder field ecosystem etc. similarly non-cultivated can be subdivided into forest ecosystem tall grass ecosystem short grass ecosystem desert ecosystem seeweeds ecosystem etc. bibilography: physical geography savindra uploaded by sheikh kawoosa 
25	in this book the focus has been placed on the squirrel cage motor the most common type of motor on the market. it is relatively cheap and the maintenance cost is normally low. there are many different manufacturers represented on the market selling at various prices. not all motors have the same performance and quality as for example motors from abb. high efficiency enables significant savings in energy costs during the motors normal endurance. the low level of noise is something else that is of interest today as is the ability to withstand severe environments. there are also other parameters that differ. the design of the rotor affects the starting current and torque and the variation can be really large between different manufacturers for the same power rating. when using a softstarter it is good if the motor has a high starting torque at direct-on-line d.o.l start. when these motors are used together with a softstarter it is possible to reduce the starting current further when compared to motors with low starting torque. the number of poles also affects the technical data. a motor with two poles often has a lower starting torque than motors with four or more poles.voltage three-phase single speed motors can normally be connected for two different voltage levels. the three stator windings are connected in star y or delta d. the windings can also be connected in series or parallel y or yy for instance. if the rating plate on a squirrel cage motor indicates voltages for both the star and delta connection it is possible to use the motor for both  v and  v as an the winding is delta connected at  v and if the main voltage is  v the y-connection is when changing the main voltage it is important to remember that for the same power rating the rated motor current will change depending on the the method for connecting the motor to the terminal blocks for star or delta connection is shown in the picture below. wiring diagram for y and delta connection

25	the electric potential difference between two points is defined as the mechanical done per unit charge against electrical forces in moving a positive point charge slowly between two points. if one of the points is taken to be a reference point with zero potential then the electric potential at any point can be defined in terms of the work done per unit charge in moving a positive point charge from that reference point to the point at which the potential is to be determined. for isolated charges the reference point is usually taken to be infinity. the potential is measured in volts.  volt   the electric potential is analogous to temperature: there is a different temperature at every point in space and the temperature gradient indicates the direction and magnitude of the driving force behind heat flow. similarly there is an electric potential at every point in space and its gradient indicates the direction and magnitude of the driving force behind charge movement. 
25	behaviour of the electromagnetic field a hydrodynamic interpretation the electric and magnetic vector fields can be thought of as being the velocities of a pair of fluids which permeate space. in the absence of charges these fluids would be at rest so that their velocity fields would be zero. electric charges act either as sources or sinks of the electric fluid. an electron is constantly absorbing electric fluid around it at some rate call it . protons are the reverse: they constantly pour electric liquid towards the surrounding space at rate  so liquid moves away from the proton with speed where r is distance of the fluid away from the proton so that the total flux of liquid going through any imaginary sphere which contains that proton is the area of the sphere times the speed of the fluid flowing through it: . magnetic liquid on the other hand has no sources or sinks: nothing can pour out or suck up magnetic fluid. magnetic fluid is incompressible which means that its density does not change: it is not possible to compress a lot of magnetic fluid into a smaller space or to squash it out of a given volume. electric fluid is also incompressible but it has sources and sinks. if magnetic fluid is standing still it can be stirred up making it move in closed circles and closed loops see vortical motion. for the magnetic fluid to keep moving in the same loop though some force has to keep stirring it up: otherwise the energy of its circular motion will dissipate and the magnetic fluid will stop moving and will return to rest. if electric fluid starts to accelerate in a certain direction it will cause a vortex of magnetic fluid to move in circles around the direction in which the electric fluid is accelerating according to the right hand rule. as soon as the electric fluid stops accelerating the vortex of magnetic fluid vanishes. notice that: electric fluid will not accelerate spontaneously. something has to force it to accelerate. this same thing then causes indirectly the magnetic vortex to be stirred up. a magnetic vortex will not arise spontaneously. finally if magnetic fluid accelerates in a certain direction it causes electric fluid to move in a vortex which circles around the direction of acceleration in the direction opposite to the right hand rule. summarily: an acceleration of the electric fluid causes a positive vortex of magnetic liquid to move around it but an acceleration of the magnetic liquid causes a negative vortex of electric liquid to flow around it. why the opposite signs? the opposite signs create a negative feedback loop see lenz's law. an acceleration of electric fluid causes a positive magnetic vortex. this means that the magnetic fluid has been accelerated to produce this circular flow. but this causes a negative vortex of electric fluid around the magnetic vortex. this reactive vortical acceleration of electric fluid is in the direction opposite of the original acceleration of electric fluid: hence a negative feedback loop: if there were a positive feedback loop the result would be presumably similar to the effect produced by a microphone too close to its speaker: a deafening high pitched resonant noise. the positive feedback would cause the original acceleration of electric fluid to amplify itself continually while at the same time the vortices around it would amplify as well: an explosive maelstrom of movement of electromagnetic fluid. fortunately the laws of electromagnetism being what they are an initial disturbance acceleration of the electric fluid will cause feedback loop which being negative will tend to extinguish itself at its source but which will propagate outwards in what is called an electromagnetic wave. flaw in the velocity field interpretation the fluid analogy does not work in this sense: that objects immersed in a moving fluid e.g. a river tend to be pushed by that fluid in such a way that the velocity of the object aligns with the velocity of the fluid. once the velocities are aligned the fluid's motion should vanish from the object's point of view. however the force of an electric field on a charged particle is  and this force is independent of the velocity of the particle which means that the particle will accelerate continually in the direction of the field. if the field is the velocity field of a fluid then the fluid would be causing the object to accelerate continually in the direction of the fluid's motion to the point that the object's speed becomes way larger than the fluid it is immersed in. this is paradoxical. from the continually accelerating object's point of view see principle of relativity if its speed has already surpassed the speed of the fluid then the fluid is moving backwards so the field should be pointing in the direction opposite to the direction in which the object keeps accelerating. this means that the object should stop accelerating and begin decelerating until its speed aligns with the speed of the electric fluid. the field as a stream of moving photons an alternative interpretation would be that the field is not actually a velocity field but a flux density field of photonic fluid which is constantly moving at the same speed: the speed of light independent of the speed of the observer the charged object. photonic fluid never changes speed but can change net direction and the intensity of its net movement in that direction. the velocity field interpretation is related to the hypothesis of a luminiferous aether through which electromagnetic waves would propagate. the existence of the aether was disproved by the michelson-morley experiment and the necessity of having an aether vanished when it was replaced by einstein's theory of relativity. according to special relativity the lorentz force equation reduces to the equation the magnetic field becomes a relativistic by-product of the electric field. i.e. lorentz transformations cause magnetic fields to be induced from electric fields and vice versa. so the photonic fluid describes the electric field and relativistic effects account for the derivative magnetic field. this can be derived by applying a lorentz transformation to a simplified version of maxwell's equations and it is mentioned by einstein in his paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies. the speed of light is invariant under a lorentz transformation but the velocity of light is changed. the component of the velocity of light parallel to the boost is left unchanged but the transversal component is rotated: it is accelerated in a direction parallel to the boost. the addition of special relativity allows the combination of the electric and magnetic fields into a single tensor field. the tensor character of this combined electromagnetic field implies that the field is anisotropic with respect to the velocity of the charged particle on which it produces a force: the lorentz force varies with the velocity of the charged particle. light and electromagnetic waves electrically charged particles are constantly emitting or absorbing photonic fluid which is more commonly known as light. so how is light related to electromagnetic waves? e-m waves are undulatory movement patterns of light which can always be observed to be emitted by electric charges undergoing acceleration. if a charged particle is at rest then it does not emit electromagnetic waves. instead it is surrounded by an electrostatic field. if the charged particle is in inertial motion then the electrostatic field is joined by a magnetostatic field. these pair of static fields produce a movement of electromagnetic energy i.e. a field of non-zero poynting vectors which is similar to an electromagnetic wave except that the fields are not oscillating. e-m waves are propagating expanding harmonic oscillating accelerations of the photonic fluid. since the photonic fluid itself moves at the speed of light by definition then e-m waves can move no faster than the speed of light. e-m waves move at a speed close to the speed of light depending on the medium through which they move e.g. faster in air than through water and faster through water than through a glass lens. ocean currents are movements of water and wind is the movement of air and the electromagnetic field is the movement of light. the electromagnetic field as a feedback loop the behavior of the electromagnetic field can be resolved into four different parts of a loop:  the electric and magnetic fields are generated by electric charges  the electric and magnetic fields interact only with each other  the electric and magnetic fields produce forces on electric charges  the electric charges move in space. the feedback loop can be summarized in a list including phenomena belonging to each part of the loop:  charges generate fields o gauss's law coulomb's law: charges generate electric fields o ampres law: currents generate magnetic fields   the fields interact with each other o displacement current: changing electric field acts like a current generating vortex of magnetic field o faraday induction: changing magnetic field induces negative vortex of electric field o lenz's law: negative feedback loop between electric and magnetic fields o maxwell-hertz equations: simplified version of maxwell's equations o electromagnetic wave equation  fields act upon charges o lorentz force: force due to electromagnetic field  electric force: same direction as electric field  magnetic force: perpendicular both to magnetic field and to velocity of charge  o continuity equation: current is movement of charges phenomena in the list are marked with a star  if they consist of magnetic fields and moving charges which can be reduced by suitable lorentz transformations to electric fields and static charges. this means that the magnetic field ends up being conceptually reduced to an appendage of the electric field i.e. something which interacts with reality only indirectly through the electric field. 
25	ruska ernst august friedrich  german physicist electrical engineer and nobel prize winner. for his design of and subsequent improvements to the instrument ruska shared the  nobel prize in physics with physicists gerd karl binnig of germany and heinrich rohrer of switzerland who designed the scanning tunneling microscope stm. born in heidelberg ruska earned an engineering degree from the university of berlin in  and a ph.d. degree in . in  ruska accepted a research position at siemens-reiniger-werke. he remained there until  when he became director of the institute for electron microscopy of the fritz haber institute. concurrently ruska served at the institute and as professor at the technical university of berlin from  until his retirement in . before leaving the university of berlin in the 1930s, ruska had already made the contribution to science that would bring him fame. he knew that electrons possess a wave aspect so he believed he could treat them in a fashion similar to light waves. ruska also aware that magnetic fields could manipulate electrons possibly focusing them as optical lenses do light. after confirming these principles through research he set out to design an electron microscope. had deduced that an electron microscope would be much more powerful than an ordinary optical microscope because he knew that magnification increased with shorter reflective waves. since electron waves were shorter than ordinary light waves it followed that they would allow for greater magnification. in  ruska and a collaborator german physicist under whom he obtained his doctorate built the first crude electron microscope. despite the fact that primitive and not fit for practical use instrument was still capable magnifying objects  times. although modern electron microscopes magnify an object  million times still based upon ruska's prototype and his correlation between wavelength and magnification. the electron microscope is an integral part of many laboratories. researchers use it to examine biological materials such microorganisms and cells variety large molecules medical biopsy samples metals and crystalline structures and the characteristics of various surfaces. microsoft  encarta  reference library microsoft corporation. all rights reserved. 
25	transmission electron microscope tem the original form of electron microscope the transmission electron microscope tem uses a high voltage electron beam to create an image. the electrons are emitted by an electron gun commonly fitted with a tungsten filament cathode as the electron source. the electron beam is accelerated by an anode typically at   to  kev with respect to the cathode focused by electrostatic and lenses and transmitted through the specimen that is in part transparent to electrons and in part electron them out of the beam. when it emerges from the specimen the electron beam carries information about the structure of the specimen that is magnified by the objective lens system of the microscope. the spatial variation in this information the image may be viewed by projecting the magnified electron image onto a fluorescent viewing screen coated with a phosphor or scintillator material such as zinc sulfide. alternatively the image can be photographically recorded by exposing a photographic film or photographic directly to the electron beam or a high resolution phosphor may be coupled by means of a lens optical system or a fibre optic light-guide to the sensor of a ccd charge-coupled device camera. the image detected by the ccd may be displayed on a monitor or computer. resolution of the tem is limited primarily by spherical aberration but a new generation of aberration correctors have been able to partially overcome spherical aberration to increase resolution. hardware correction of spherical aberration for the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem has allowed the production of images with resolution below . angstrom  picometres nameerni and magnifications above  million times.cite web scale of things of basic energy sciences u.s. department of energy the ability to determine the positions of atoms within materials has made the hrtem an important tool for nano-technologies research and development.cite  o'keefe ma allard lf  sub-ngstrom electron microscopy for sub ngstrom bridge: doe scientific and technical information  sponsored by osti an important mode of tem utilization is electron diffraction. the advantages of electron diffraction over x-ray crystallography are that the specimen need not be a single crystal or even a polycrystalline powder and also that the fourier transform reconstruction of the object's magnified structure occurs physically and thus avoids the need for solving the phase problem faced by the x-ray crystallographers after obtaining their x-ray diffraction patterns of a single crystal or polycrystalline powder. the major disadvantage of the transmission electron microscope is the need for extremely thin sections of the specimens typically about  nanometers. biological specimens typically require to be chemically fixed dehydrated and embedded in a polymer resin to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin sectioning. sections of biological specimens organic polymers and similar materials may require special staining with heavy atom labels in order to achieve the required image contrast. file:ant image of an ant in a scanning electron microscope unlike the tem where electrons of the high voltage beam carry the image of the specimen the electron beam of the scanning electron microscope semcite conference electron microscopy annual meeting of the microscopy society of does not at any time carry a complete image of the specimen. the sem produces images by probing the specimen with a focused electron beam that is scanned across a rectangular area of the specimen raster scanning. when the electron beam interacts with the specimen it loses energy by a variety of mechanisms. the lost energy is converted into alternative forms such as heat emission of secondary secondary electrons and high-energy backscattered electrons light emission cathodoluminescence or x-ray emission which provide signals carrying information about the properties of the specimen surface such as its topography and composition. the image displayed by an sem maps the varying intensity of any of these signals into the image in a position corresponding to the position of the beam on the specimen when the signal was generated. in the sem image of an ant shown at right the image was constructed from signals produced by a secondary electron detector the normal or conventional imaging mode in most sems. generally the image resolution of an sem is about an order of magnitude poorer than that of a tem. however because the sem image relies on surface processes rather than transmission it is able to image bulk samples up to many centimetres in size and depending on instrument design and settings has a great depth of field and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional shape of the sample. another advantage of sem is its variety called environmental scanning electron microscope esem can produce images of sufficient quality and resolution with the samples being wet or contained in low vacuum or gas. this greatly facilitates imaging biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes. in the reflection electron microscope rem as in the tem an electron beam is incident on a surface but instead of using the transmission tem or secondary electrons sem the reflected beam of elastic scattered electrons is detected. this technique is typically coupled with high energy electron diffraction rheed and reflection high-energy loss spectroscopy rhels. another variation is spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy spleem which is used for looking at the microstructure of magnetic domains.cite web center for electron microscopy title spleem scanning transmission electron microscope transmission electron microscopy the stem rasters a focused incident probe across a specimen that as with the tem has been thinned to facilitate detection of electrons scattered through the specimen. the high resolution of the tem is thus possible in stem. the focusing action and aberrations occur before the electrons hit the specimen in the stem but afterward in the tem. the stems use of sem-like beam rastering simplifies annular dark-field imaging and other analytical techniques but also means that image data is acquired in serial rather than in parallel fashion. often tem can be equipped with the scanning option and then it can function both as tem and stem. the low-voltage electron microscope lvem is a combination of sem tem and stem in one instrument which operates at relatively low electron accelerating voltage of  kv. low voltage reduces the specimen damage by the incident electrons and increases image contrast that is especially important for biological specimens. this increase in contrast significantly reduces or even eliminates the need to stain. sectioned samples generally need to be thinner than they would be for conventional tem nbspnm. resolutions of a few nm are possible in tem sem and stem modes.cite journal marie to observe small biological objects in low-voltage electron microscope

25	rem is a combination of imaging diffraction and spectroscopy techniques for characterization of topography crystal structure and composition of surfaces of single crystals. high-energy electrons are incident at glancing angles to the surface and reflected electrons are used to form an rem image a reflection high energy electron diffraction pattern rheed and a reflection high-energy loss spectrum reels. these techniques are applicable to metal semiconductor and ceramic surfaces. studies have been performed in ultra-high vacuum uhv or conventional transmission tem and scanning transmission stem electron microscopes. 
25	electron microscope is a microscope that uses accelerated electrons as a source of illumination. because the wavelength of an electron can be up to  times shorter than that of visible light photons the electron microscope has a higher resolving power than alight microscope  pmresolution  nmresolution the transmission electron microscope uses electrostatic and electromagnetic lenses to control the electron beam and focus it to form an image. these electron optical lenses are analogous to the glass lenses of an optical light microscope. electron microscopes are used to investigate the ultrastructure of a wide range of biological and inorganic specimens includingmicroorganisms cells large molecules biopsy samples metals and crystals. industrially the electron microscope is often used for quality control and failure analysis. modern electron microscopes produce electron micrographs using specialized digital cameras or frame grabbers to capture the image.

25	email is much older than arpanet or the internet. it was never invented it evolved from very simple beginnings.br early email was just a small advance on what we know these days as a file directory  it just put a message in another user's directory in a spot where they could see it when they logged in. simple as that. just like leaving a note on someone's desk.br probably the first email system of this type was mailbox used at massachusetts institute of technology from . another early program to send messages on the same computer was called sndmsg.br some of the mainframe computers of this era might have had up to one hundred users often they used what are called dumb terminals to access the mainframe from their work desks. dumb terminals just connected to the mainframe  they had no storage or memory of their own they did all their work on the remote mainframe computer.br before internetworking began therefore email could only be used to send messages to various users of the same computer. once computers began to talk to each other over networks however the problem became a little more complex  we needed to be able to put a message in an envelope and address it. to do this we needed a means to indicate to whom letters should go that the electronic posties understood  just like the postal system we needed a way to indicate an address.br this is why ray tomlinson is credited with inventing email in . like many of the internet inventors tomlinson worked for bolt beranek and newman as an arpanet contractor. he picked the  symbol from the computer keyboard to denote sending messages from one computer to another. so then for anyone using internet standards it was simply a matter of nominating name-of-the username-of-the-computer. internet pioneer jon postel who we will hear more of later was one of the first users of the new system and is credited with describing it as a nice hack. it certainly was and it has lasted to this day. br despite what the world wide web offers email remains the most important application of the internet and the most widely used facility it has. now more than  million people internationally use email.br by  there were hundreds of military users of email because arpanet eventually encouraged it. email became the saviour of arpanet and caused a radical shift in arpa's purpose. things developed rapidly from there. larry roberts invented some email folders for his boss so he could sort his mail a big advance. in  john vital developed some software to organize email. by  email had really taken off and commercial packages began to appear. within a couple of years  of all arpanet traffic was email.br email took us from arpanet to the internet. here was something that ordinary people all over the world wanted to use. as ray tomlinson observed some years later about email any single development is stepping on the heels of the previous one and is so closely followed by the next that most advances are obscured. i think that few individuals will be remembered. that's true  to catalogue all the developments would be a huge task. one of the first new developments when personal computers came on the scene was offline readers. offline readers allowed email users to store their email on their own personal computers and then read it and prepare replies without actually being connected to the network  sort of like microsoft outlook can do today.br this was particularly useful in parts of the world where telephone costs to the nearest email system were expensive. often this involved international calls in the early days with connection charges of many dollars a minute it mattered to be able to prepare a reply without being connected to a telephone and then get on the network to send it. it was also useful because the offline mode allowed for more friendly interfaces. being connected direct to the host email system in this era of very few standards often resulted in delete keys and backspace keys not working no capacity for text to wrap around on the screen of the users computer and other such annoyances. offline readers helped a lot. the first important email standard was called smtp or simple message transfer protocol. smtp was very simple and is still in use  however as we will hear later in this series smtp was a fairly nave protocol and made no attempt to find out whether the person claiming to send a message was the person they purported to be. forgery was and still is very easy in email addresses. these basic flaws in the protocol were later to be exploited by viruses and worms and by security frauds and spammers forging identities. some of these problems are still being addressed in . but as it developed email started to take on some pretty neat features. one of the first good commercial systems was eudora developed by steve dorner in . not long after pegasus mail appeared. when internet standards for email began to mature the pop or post office protocol servers began to appear as a standard  before that each server was a little different. pop was an important standard to allow users to develop mail systems that would work with each other. these were the days of per-minute charges for email for individual dialup users. for most people on the internet in those days email and email discussion groups were the main uses. these were many hundreds of these on a wide variety of topics and as a body of newsgroups they became known as usenet. br with the world wide web email started to be made available with friendly web interfaces by providers such as yahoo

25	one such useful reference frame is called the rest frame for simple objects and called the center of momentum frame for systems of objects. these reference inertial frames are useful because certain types of energy including some kinetic energy in systems cannot be arbirarily made to completely disappear by choice of reference frame. the reason for this is that choosing a frame which makes kinetic energy diappear for one particle may make it appear for another particle in relative motion in the same system. in general kinetic energy appears in such systems as part of an invariant quantity when they are viewed in the reference frame in which the total vector momentum of the system is zero. in such cases the total energy of the system appears as an invariant and determines the invariant mass of the system. invariant mass and the energy associated with it are independent of the observer and they are what determine familiar aspects of objects such as weight and gravitational field. the energy associated with the invariant mass of an object is sometimes called the rest energy of the object even when the object is composed of moving parts such as vibrating atoms or moving molecules of gas.   some of the invariant mass of systems may be present forms which may be easily extracted to do work as chemical or nuclear potential energy or in forms that are less easily extracted and capable of work only in certain circumstances such as heat. however all these types of energy are associated with mass. the invariant mass of an object may thus be thought of as certain amount of frozen energy some of which may be available to do work depending on circumstance. energy in the of natural sciences 
25	energy distant it was generally construed that behind all changes involved. forms. while in spiritualism they were reflected in changes in a person in physical sciences it is reflected in different of energy. for example as fuels technology is invariably concerned with finding ways to harness energy resources and to use it to do useful work. this invariably requires transfer of heat. results in kind of energy therefore: reaction. the relationship between heat and energy similar to that between work and energy. that is related to random definition is energy with reference to physics is available at.  pdflink actual first-law energy in relation to free energy and entropy 
25	energy in the context of natural sciences: physics chemistry biology etc. is defined via work of certain force involved. because there are various forces there are numerous kinds of energy. mechanical energy is defined as a sum of kinetic energy and potential energy. potential energy is defined as a work to rearrange mutual positions of bodies. kinetic energy is defined as a work to accelerate bodies etc. because often this work is reversible then it is called stored or potential work energy. for example chemical potential energy of electric charges stored in chemical bonds between atoms electrical energy due to change of positions of electrical thermal plus energy of motion and vibrations of individual molecules nuclear energy of mutual position of protons and neutrons atomic nucleus light can be viewed as energy in the form of photons or waves depending on the context. calculation of work to accelerate body using theory of special relativity results in equivalence of mass and energy. another form of energy a form of energy said to dominate the universe is called dark energy. the word energy is often used in contexts outside the natural sciences. to mathematicians engineers physicists and scientists the word has a strict and quantifiable definition via work. the mixing of the non-scientific and scientific definitions of the word is because it leads to confusion. in the context of economics the term energy is used in discussions related to energy such as fuels petroleum products and electric power generation that enable us to use machines. in the context of psychology sociology politics etc. energy can be in in the form of energy embodied energy and perhaps psychic energy. in the context of common speech the word energy is used to describe the behavior of individuals. this may be similar to the physical use of the term work force x distance although this form is in fact quite different. energy can be used to describe someone with a vigorous enterprising hard working or ambitious drive or to describe someones physical and mental capacity when applied to a particular activity or to describe someone with an vivid imagination implying vitality and intensity of expression. in the context of the word cannot be quantified or even defined. the term energy see vitalism in such contexts is used in traditional and new age mysticism and in fields such as parapsychology acupuncture. the word energy is often used as reiki in japanese culture qi traditional chinese culture and prana kundalini and shakti in traditional indian spiritual culture. paranormal researchers will often refer to psychokinetic energy when attempting to explain paranormal phenomena or the concept of a spirit or soul. the psychiatrist and psychoanalyst wilhelm reich coined the term orgone energy for the non physical energy of consciousness. however in molecular biology or biochemistry energy is the source of all biological processes and is due to the making and breaking of certain chemical bonds in the molecules found in biological organisms. these bonds are most often bonds in carbohydrates or parts. thus glucose and fructose are the main sources of energy for most biological process.

25	causes of the war why did the civil war break out in ? this essay outlines the causes of the civil war.the causes will be split into  categories: religion money and power. i shall then summarise my findings in a brief conclusion. one of the causes related to religion of the war related to religion is that james had established a theory that all kings ruled by divine right. this meant that every king or queen in the history of english monarchy was chosen by god and therefore could not be overruled so no man or women can be better than them. parliament didnt like not having any power so they restricted the  kings by not giving him any tax money. another reason for the outbreak of the civil war was that when charles married henrietta maria a french catholic. charles didn't choose to marry her his father james set up the marriage the public especially the puritans didn't like having a catholic as queen. a few extremists even saw this as a sign that charles was secretly catholic himself! a furthur religious reason for a civil war is that after the king dissolved parliament he made william laud the archbishop of canterbury in . while laud was archbishop he made many changes to the church. most of these changes involved making the church beautiful again this included: robes for priests statues and stained-glass windows. the puritans were then even more convinced that charles was a catholic. the final religious reason for the civil war is that in  archbishop laud decided to introduce the english prayer book into scotland. there was nationwide rioting in scotland because no one wanted to follow the new prayer book. scotland was a puritan country and they thought that the english prayer book was far too catholic to use in scotland. this eventually led to many scots marching down the country in an attempt to invade england. the first influence concerning money is that parliament would not give james and charles the money they needed to rule the country. this links to the theory that both kings believed they ruled by divine right and so parliament were not allowed a say in the ruling of the country so they denied the king any tax money in revenge. because the king didnt have any money he resorted to cheating it out of people. he invented a tax called ship money that had to be paid by coastal towns for protection by the navy. some people refused to pay the tax because it was illegal. as a result more people in england became angry with the king. another way charles cheated people out of their money is that he made noblemen pay to become knights and if they refused they had to pay a fine. so either way charles made money. this angered more people in england. one power influence was that in  charles dismissed parliament because they would not heed to his demands for tax money. parliament was dismissed for  years in which time he introduced ship money and other illegal taxes. charles recalled parliament on 13th april  to ask for money to fight the rebellious scots. parliament refused so charles dissolved them on the 5th may . parliament eventually agreed to lend charles  a day to maintain his army. a further reason linked to power for the civil war is that in  parliament executed archbishop laud and the earl of stratford. with this the irish who had recently been conquered by the earl of stratford rebelled and this time parliament took control of the army leaving the king feeling very angry. unlike when fighting the scots the english army was strong because they had a lot of money they defeated the irish easily. this cause was maybe one of the most important triggers of the war. one final reason for the civil war is that after being denied control of the army charles marched to the houses of parliament with  men to arrest  of the leading members of parliament. but before they reached the gates the members had jumped out of a window and sailed down the thames on a boat. angered by this last ditch attempt to destroy them parliament issued a list of demands to the king in an attempt to bring back peace. the king refused. this was the final trigger of the civil war. i believe that the most influencial category that triggered the civil war was power because that was what the war was about the power to rule the country. if the parliament hadnt been so demanding about their control the war wouldnt of started. the war claimed over thankyou for taking the time to read this essay 
25	thermodynamics. a. on a macroscopic scale a function of thermodynamic variables as temperature pressure or composition that is a measure of the energy that is not available for work during a thermodynamic process. a closed system evolves toward a state of maximum entropy. b. in statistical mechanics a measure of the randomness of the microscopic constituents of a thermodynamic system. symbol: s . in data transmission and information theory a measure of the loss of information in a transmitted signal or message. . in cosmology a hypothetical tendency for the universe to attain a state of maximum homogeneity in which all matter is at a uniform temperature heat death. . a doctrine of inevitable social decline and degeneration 
25	tentropy the tentropy is a phenomenon of atomic electronic or functional group's motions within a supra molecular structure. for example the proteins dendrimers macromolecules copolymers block polymers and graft polymers do have different structural environment within a single molecules. the structurally different environment due to energy gradients does cause different or localized functionality inside the molecules. this different functionality with different localized charges generate different isotropies with different orientation with kinetic motions. these kinetic motions within the fixed molecular boundaries is noted as tentropy. this is very prominent in case of the dendrimers because the dendrimers do have terminal branchings with respect to the core a central most part of the dendrimers molecules. thus the core and terminal branches do have different kinetic environment in different isotropies are responsible for tentropy. similarly the friccohesity which works based on molecular activities at surface and bulk phases. in general the bulk phase has larger surface area and does show an additive effect on addition of solute to solvent but surface since it is confined to a comparatively smaller area and quickly get saturated and because of these reasons it shows structural changes without any linear relationship with solute concentration. however when the surface becomes saturated then the linear relationship with solute amount and surface tension is noted. 
25	in a recent work published in physica a a leading peer reviewed international journal of statistical and thermal physics dr. dhiraj sinha has presented a novel formulation of entropy while incorporating the role of conservative vector fields in determining the total entropy change of a system in a thermodynamic process cite changes in a thermodynamic process under potential gradientsphysica a   dhiraj it has been argued that the entropy change of a thermodynamic process can be expressed as a ratio of differential change in hamiltonian and potential of the system to its temperature. thus the entropy rate of a process may be slowed or reversed depending on the time dependence of the hamiltonian and potential energy of the system. this formulation of entropy in terms of changes in hamiltonian and potential of a process can provide a new tool in the analysis of thermodynamic systems as principles from classical mechanics and field theory can be leveraged in the analysis evolution and general behaviour of thermodynamic systems. 
25	 however for short time scales certain experiments have demonstrated violations of the second law of thermodynamics. for example the trajectory of colliodal particles in water held in an optical trap showed deviation from the second law of thermodynamics over a period of a tenth of a second. cite g. m. sevick e. m. mittag e. searles d. j.  evans d. j. . experimental demonstration of violations of the second law of thermodynamics for small systems and short time scales. physical review letters  .  earlier it was theoretically proved that the trajectory of phases which result in violation of the second law vanishes in an exponential manner with time.cite d. j.  searles d. j. . equilibrium microstates which generate second law violating steady states. physical review e  . a related phenomenon where the system's entropy is reduced spontaneously is stochastic resonance in which a system extracts energy from noise and the signal to noise ratio is enhanced resulting in a increase of order. v. s. neiman a. b. moss f.  shimansky-geier l. . stochastic resonance: noise-enhanced order. physics-uspekhi  . . it has been suggested that in a thermodynamic process having conservative force fields potential energy gradients can reduce entropy leading the system to a state of reduced entropy and increased order.cite sinha . entropy changes in a thermodynamic process under potential gradients physica a.-

25	ergonomics also known as human engineering or human factors engineering the science of designing machines products and systems to maximize the safety comfort and efficiency of the people who use them. ergonomists draw on the principles of industrial engineering psychology anthropometry the science of human measurement and biomechanics the study of muscular activity to adapt the design of products and workplaces to people's sizes and shapes and their physical strengths and limitations. ergonomists also consider the speed with which humans react and how they process information and their capacities for dealing with psychological factors such as stress or isolation. armed with this complete picture of how humans interact with their environment ergonomists develop the best possible design for products and systems ranging from the handle of a toothbrush to the flight deck of the space shuttle. ergonomists view people and the objects they use as one unit and ergonomic design blends the best abilities of people and machines. humans are not as strong as machines nor can they calculate as quickly and accurately as computers. unlike machines humans need to sleep and they are subject to illness accidents or making mistakes when working without adequate rest. but machines are also limited-cars cannot repair themselves computers do not speak or hear as well as people do and machines cannot adapt to unexpected situations as well as humans. an ergonomically designed system provides optimum performance because it takes advantage of the strengths and weaknesses of both its human and machine components. applications designing with people in mind often requires advanced technology such as computer-aided manufacturing programs and robots to simulate human responses. other ergonomic tools may be relatively simple. ergonomists frequently use two or three dimensional mannequins that represent particular dimensions of the human body such as seated height or arm length or reach. using such tools ergonomists create products and workstations that fit  percent of the possible users. to help evaluate the tools and systems people use in the course of their day ergonomists use simulations-replicas of workstations aircraft and other scenarios together with observations of people operating equipment and products in the replicated environment. aworkplace illness and accident prevention one of the primary goals of ergonomics is prevention of workplace illness and accidents. according to the united states bureau of labor statistics more than  percent of the workplace illnesses reported each year are associated with repetitive stress injuries rsi. these injuries result from continuous repetition of the same motions for instance screwing or twisting items on an assembly line. the injury may be exacerbated by awkward postures such as bending or reaching. carpal tunnel syndrome for example is a painful and often debilitating swelling of the tendons in the wrist which results from overuse of the hands and wrists. it is particularly common in people who must bend or overextend their arms while performing a repetitive task for instance typing on a computer keyboard cutting meat or tripping knobs and levers. frequent unassisted heavy lifting for example moving hospital patients in and out of beds is one of the leading causes of work-related back injuries. noise induced hearing loss resulting from continuous exposure to excessive noise is another type of rsi as are headaches and eyestrain due to improper workplace lighting. ergonomists work to eliminate these problems by designing workplaces such as offices or assembly lines with injury prevention in mind. they position tools and machinery to be accessible without twisting reaching or bending. they design adjustable workbenches desks and chairs to comfortably accommodate workers of many different sizes preventing the need to continuously lean or overextend the arms. ergonomists also determine and design safe workplace environmental conditions such as correct temperature lighting noise and ventilation to ensure that workers perform under optimal conditions. ergonomists also seek to increase worker efficiency and productivity when designing workspaces. they place those pieces of equipment used most frequently in closest proximity to the worker and arrange systems in ways that are convenient and easy to use. well-designed workspaces ensure that workers perform their jobs in optimal comfort without experiencing the unnecessary physical and mental fatigue that can slow work performance reduce accuracy or cause accidents. other ergonomists design the individual tools or equipment a worker uses. specially curved computer keyboards encourage typists to hold their wrists in a position that is less likely to cause carpal tunnel syndrome. to protect the eyes from incessant glare ergonomically designed computer monitors are equipped with glare reduction screens. ergonomically designed chairs distribute a person's body weight evenly to avoid back and neck strain. these chairs adjust to a user's height to ensure that the feet rest flat on the ground. in factories and assembly lines ergonomically designed knobs and levers are positioned appropriately so as not to require reaching and these knobs and levers also require minimal force to trip. by employing the best possible design for safety systems ergonomists minimize workplace accidents. ergonomists consider the way humans interpret information their reaction speed and how both of these factors are influenced by the stress of an emergency. warning signals such as lights buzzers and sirens must be easy to interpret. control devices must be easy to identify and use particularly in workplaces such as aircraft vehicles and nuclear power plants where quick accurate reactions are imperative to public safety. a poorly designed control panel was a factor during the near meltdown of the nuclear generating station at three mile island pennsylvania in . maximizing job performance and efficiency some ergonomists practice in the area of job design. these professionals help employers assess both the individual tasks necessary to perform a particular job and the skills needed to accomplish each task. by grouping like tasks and skills jobs can be redesigned to maximize efficiency. an office telephone receptionist for example may perform a number of other tasks as varied as filing sorting mail and bookkeeping. grouping these responsibilities which can all be performed in the vicinity of the office telephone system makes use of the receptionist's time when there are no telephone calls. ergonomists help employers evaluate different ways of organizing workdays to increase worker productivity ensuring that workers have adequate breaks and rest periods as well as a well-defined set of tasks. an ergonomist may use similar skill-analysis principles to help an employer identify the best candidate for a particular job. by working with the employer to define the physical mental and social skills needed to perform a job ergonomists can determine the necessary qualifications and help employers with personnel selection. job task and skill analysis is also used to determine the most effective ways to train employees. training for astronauts and pilots for example may include simulations developed by ergonomists. training simulations such as computer virtual reality training teach trainees how to deal with dangerous scenarios such as accidents without exposing them to the dangers of a real accident. ergonomists also design virtual reality simulations for medical doctors enabling them to practice diagnostic and surgical skills on computer simulated patients thereby not endangering the health of a live patient. information design cognitive ergonomists specialize in information design-the best way to present complex information. these professionals study the way the human brain processes information. using this knowledge and the principles of graphic design cognitive ergonomists develop signs maps instruction manuals and even computer programs and internet sites that are easy to use or intuitive. the work of cognitive ergonomists is particularly evident in public transportation buildings such as airports or train stations. these buildings are often large complex and difficult to navigate. cognitive ergonomists develop clear easy-to-understand navigation aids such as signs and maps to help people find their way to their gate as simply and efficiently as possible. color-coded subway maps for example help subway riders navigate with relative ease through a complicated maze of interconnected underground tunnels. cognitive ergonomists also work with manufacturers to design the instruction manuals packaged with consumer products. they evaluate the tasks required to assemble or operate the goods and present the tasks as a set of sequential easy to follow instructions. when designing instruction manuals cognitive ergonomists must consider not only the way the brain processes information but also the way people expect to receive instructional information. as they develop and learn humans grow accustomed to receiving different types of information in particular formats. when information does not conform to its customary format people may find it difficult to follow or understand. consumer product design ergonomic design makes consumer products safer easier to use and more reliable. in many manufacturing industries ergonomists work with designers to develop products that fit the bodies and meet the expectations of the people who will use them. an ergonomically designed toothbrush for example has a broad handle for easy grip a bent neck for easier access to back teeth and a bristle head shaped for better tooth surface contact. the shaving razor has undergone a similar design revolution. the bent-handled easy-grip models popular today are more comfortable to use and have a better shaving performance than the straight edged razors of days gone by. ergonomic design has dramatically changed the interior appearance of automobiles. the steering wheel-once a solid awkward disk-is now larger and padded for an easier more comfortable grip. its center is removed to improve the driver's view of the instruments on the dashboard. larger contoured seats adjustable to suit a variety of body sizes and posture preferences have replaced the small upright seats of early automobiles. equipped with seatbelts and adjustable headrests that prevent the neck from snapping backward in the event of a collision modern automobile seats are not only more comfortable they are also safer. the principles of ergonomic design affect other features of the automobile as well. the center-mounted rear windshield brake light now a required component of all new automobiles is an ergonomic innovation that saves lives. perhaps the most compelling ergonomic innovations of our time improvements to computer user interfaces have changed the way the world uses computers. graphical user interface gui is a computer display format that enables the user to choose commands start programs and see lists of files and other options by pointing to pictorial representations on the screen. by taking into account the way humans interact with machines computer scientists developed a gui that is intuitive and easy to use. this innovation made computers once the cryptic and complex tool of an elite group of scientists and mathematicians accessible to almost anyone. ergonomic improvements to computer hardware and software are ongoing. the mouse a hand-shaped input device enables users to give the computer commands with the click of a button. in the future keyboards and mice already ergonomically shaped to reduce the occurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome may be entirely replaced by voice-activated input systems. many computer users already use verbal commands touch the screen or use pencil-like instruments to enter their commands rather than typing them on a keyboard or clicking with a mouse. ergonomics profession the term ergonomics greek ergon work nomos laws first appeared in a polish article published in  but the modern discipline did not take shape until half a century later. the study of human factors did not gain much public attention until world war ii . accidents with military equipment were often blamed on human error but investigations revealed that some were caused by poorly designed controls. the modern discipline of ergonomics was born in the united kingdom on july   at an interdisciplinary meeting of those interested in human work problems in the british navy. at another meeting held on february   the term ergonomics was formally adopted for this growing discipline. today in the united states ergonomics professionals belong to the human factors and ergonomics society hfes an organization with over  members interested in topics ranging from aging and aerospace to computers. the hfes is active in developing national and international technical standards to help improve the design of products and workplaces. ergonomists also work with the united states occupational safety and health administration osha to develop ergonomic guidelines standards and regulations to ensure the safety and comfort of american workers. about  percent of hfes members have degrees in psychology or an associated behavioral science about  percent have degrees in engineering or design and others have diverse backgrounds in subjects ranging from computer science to medicine. over  universities in the united states now offer graduate or undergraduate degrees in human factors and ergonomics.

25	rnest rutherford was born on august   in nelson new zealand the fourth child and second son in a family of seven sons and five daughters. his father james rutherford a scottish wheelwright emigrated to new zealand with ernest's grandfather and the whole family in . his mother ne martha thompson was an english schoolteacher who with her widowed mother also went to live there in . ernest received his early education in government schools and at the age of  entered nelson collegiate school. in  he was awarded a university scholarship and he proceeded to the university of new zealand wellington where he entered canterbury college. he graduated m.a. in  with a double first in mathematics and physical science and he continued with research work at the college for a short time receiving the b.sc. degree the following year. that same year  he was awarded an  exhibition science scholarship enabling him to go to trinity college cambridge as a research student at the cavendish laboratory under j.j. thomson. in  he was awarded the b.a. research degree and the coutts-trotter studentship of trinity college. an opportunity came when the macdonald chair of physics at mcgill university montreal became vacant and in  he left for canada to take up the post. rutherford returned to england in  to become langworthy professor of physics in the university of manchester succeeding sir arthur schuster and in  he accepted an invitation to succeed sir joseph thomson as cavendish professor of physics at cambridge. he also became chairman of the advisory council h.m. government department of scientific and industrial research professor of natural philosophy royal institution london and director of the royal society mond laboratory cambridge. rutherford's first researches in new zealand were concerned with the magnetic properties of iron exposed to high-frequency oscillations and his thesis was entitled magnetization of iron by high-frequency discharges. he was one of the first to design highly original experiments with high-frequency alternating currents. his second paper magnetic viscosity was published in the transactions of the new zealand institute  and contains a description of a time-apparatus capable of measuring time intervals of a hundred-thousandth of a second. on his arrival at cambridge his talents were quickly recognized by professor thomson. during his first spell at the cavendish laboratory he invented a detector for electromagnetic waves an essential feature being an ingenious magnetizing coil containing tiny bundles of magnetized iron wire. he worked jointly with thomson on the behaviour of the ions observed in gases which had been treated with x-rays and also in  on the mobility of ions in relation to the strength of the electric field and on related topics such as the photoelectric effect. in  he reported the existence of alpha and beta rays in uranium radiation and indicated some of their properties. in montreal there were ample opportunities for research at mcgill and his work on radioactive bodies particularly on the emission of alpha rays was continued in the macdonald laboratory. with r.b. owens he studied the emanation of thorium and discovered a new noble gas an isotope of radon which was later to be known as thoron. frederick soddy arrived at mcgill in  from oxford and he collaborated with rutherford in creating the disintegration theory of radioactivity which regards radioactive phenomena as atomic  not molecular  processes. the theory was supported by a large amount of experimental evidence a number of new radioactive substances were discovered and their position in the series of transformations was fixed. otto hahn who later discovered atomic fission worked under rutherford at the montreal laboratory in . at manchester rutherford continued his research on the properties of the radium emanation and of the alpha rays and in conjunction with h. geiger a method of detecting a single alpha particle and counting the number emitted from radium was devised. in  his investigations into the scattering of alpha rays and the nature of the inner structure of the atom which caused such scattering led to the postulation of his concept of the nucleus his greatest contribution to physics. according to him practically the whole mass of the atom and at the same time all positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a minute space at the centre. in  niels bohr joined him at manchester and he adapted rutherford's nuclear structure to max planck's quantum theory and so obtained a theory of atomic structure which with later improvements mainly as a result of heisenberg's concepts remains valid to this day. in  together with h. g. moseley he used cathode rays to bombard atoms of various elements and showed that the inner structures correspond with a group of lines which characterize the elements. each element could then be assigned an atomic number and more important the properties of each element could be defined by this number. in  during his last year at manchester he discovered that the nuclei of certain light elements such as nitrogen could be disintegrated by the impact of energetic alpha particles coming from some radioactive source and that during this process fast protons were emitted. blackett later proved with the cloud chamber that the nitrogen in this process was actually transformed into an oxygen isotope so that rutherford was the first to deliberately transmute one element into another. g. de hevesy was also one of rutherford's collaborators at manchester. an inspiring leader of the cavendish laboratory he steered numerous future nobel prize winners towards their great achievements: chadwick blackett cockcroft and walton while other laureates worked with him at the cavendish for shorter or longer periods: g.p. thomson appleton powell and aston. c.d. ellis his co-author in  and  pointed out that the majority of the experiments at the cavendish were really started by rutherford's direct or indirect suggestion. he remained active and working to the very end of his life. rutherford published several books: radioactivity  radioactive transformations  being his silliman lectures at yale university radiation from radioactive substances with james chadwick and c.d. ellis    a thoroughly documented book which serves as a chronological list of his many papers to learned societies etc. the electrical structure of matter  the artificial transmutation of the elements  the newer alchemy . rutherford was knighted in  he was appointed to the order of merit in  and in  he was created first baron rutherford of nelson new zealand and cambridge. he was elected fellow of the royal society in  and was its president from  to . amongst his many honours he was awarded the rumford medal  and the copley medal  of the royal society the bressa prize  of the turin academy of science the albert medal  of the royal society of arts the faraday medal  of the institution of electrical engineers the d.sc. degree of the university of new zealand and honorary doctorates from the universities of pennsylvania wisconsin mcgill birmingham edinburgh melbourne yale glasgow giessen copenhagen cambridge dublin durham oxford liverpool toronto bristol cape town london and leeds. rutherford married mary newton only daughter of arthur and mary de renzy newton in . their only child eileen married the physicist r.h. fowler. rutherford's chief recreations were golf and motoring. he died in cambridge on october  . his ashes were buried in the nave of westminster abbey just west of sir isaac newton's tomb and by that of lord kelvin. from nobel lectures chemistry  elsevier publishing company amsterdam  this was

25	wind is another active agent of erosion especially in arid climates with little vegetation. wind blowing across bare land lifts particles of sand and silt but leaves behind larger pebbles and cobbles. eventually a surface layer of closely packed stones called a desert pavement is formed as the sand and silt is removed. the removal of large quantities of loose material is called deflation. deflation lowers the landscape slowly usually less than a meter  ft in a thousand years. however deflation can occur more rapidly as it did during the 1930s in the southern parts of the great plains of the united states see dust bowl. winds may sometimes deposits sand in large piles known as sand dunes. 
25	tectonic effects of erosion the removal by erosion of large amounts of rock from a particular region and its deposition elsewhere can result in a lightening of the load on the crust crust and mantle this can cause tectonic or uplift in the region. research undertaken since the early s suggests that the spatial distribution of erosion at the surface of an orogen can exert a key influence on its growth and its final internal structure. 
25	contemporary hindu eschatology is linked in the vaishnavite tradition to the figure of kalki or the tenth and last avatar of vishnu before the age draws to a close and shiva simultaneously dissolves and regenerates the universe. most hindus acknowledge as part of their cosmology that we are living in the kali yuga literally age of darkness the last of four periods yuga that make up the current age. each period has seen a successive degeneration in the moral order and character of human beings to the point that in the kali yuga where quarrel and hypocrisy are prevalent. often the invocation of kaliyuga denotes a certain helplessness in the face of the horrors and suffering of the human condition and a nostalgia for a golden past or a future salvation. however hindu conceptions of time like those found in other non-western traditions is cyclical in that one age may end but another will always begin. as such the cycle of birth growth decay death and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order of all things yet affected by the vagaries of the comings and goings of divine interventions in the vaishnavite belief. most hindus believe that shiva will destroy the world at the end of the kalpa. some shaivites hold the view that he is incessantly destroying and creating the world. 
25	as per bhavishyapuran at the end of kaliyuga i.e. present era the age of human being will be reduced to  years and they will start physical relationship at the age of  year. human beings height will be reduced to  feet. there will not be any marriage system and they will behave like animals i.e. there will be mother-son father-daughter and brother-sister physical relationship. 
25	buddhism believes in cycles in which life span of human beings changes according to human nature. in cakkavati sutta the buddha explained the relationship between life span of humanbeing and behaviour. as per this sutta in the past unskillful behavior was unknown among the human race. as a result people lived for an immensely long time   years  endowed with great beauty wealth pleasure and strength. over the course of time though they began behaving in various unskillful ways. this caused the human life span gradually to shorten to the point where it now stands at  years with human beauty wealth pleasure and strength decreasing proportionately. in the future as morality continues to degenerate human life will continue to shorten to the point were the normal life span is  years with people reaching sexual maturity at five. ultimately conditions will deteriorate to the point of a sword-interval in which swords appear in the hands of all human beings and they hunt one another like game. a few people however will take shelter in the wilderness to escape the carnage and when the slaughter is over they will come out of hiding and resolve to take up a life of skillful and virtuous action again. with the recovery of virtue the human life span will gradually increase again until it reaches  years with people attaining sexual maturity at . 
25	vaishnavitea particular sect of hindus that worship the god vishnu the destroyer the universe while it is regenerated by creator  brahma. the preceding being the satya dwapara and treta. from the satya  where all humans were benevolent wise peaceful and content elaborated upon by the lord krsna in the bhagavad gita world periodically just as brahma creates it. the most apt analogy would be the big bang  big crunch theory.

25	esther meaning star an orphaned jewish child raised in persia by mordecai her cousin was chosen by king ahasuerus to replace the vacillating and adamant queen vashti. esther originally named hadassah meaning the myrtle is the heroine of the biblical book that bears her name. hadassah received her name of esther when she entered the royal harem. esther : and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter. esther is a form of an name satarah which means star. esther was the daughter of a benjamite abihail. when cyrus gave permission for the exiles to return unto jerusalem she stayed with mordecai her cousin. 
25	esther was a person of faith goodness devotion and courage. she built upon these characteristics combining with them a sense of watchfulness. esther was devoted to her cousin mordecai and obedient to his teachings. her grace and her beauty gave her favor amongst all that she came in contact with. esther : now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what hegai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed. and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her. esther lifted up in the eyes of god became an instrument for god. because of her devotion and willingness to listen to the voice of god she was able to prevent the devastation and destruction of her people. queen esther an instrument of god used by god because of her willingness to obey the voice of god.

25	pursuits. there are several philosophical positions all related to existential philosophy but the main identifiable common proposition is that existence precedes essence. by this states that man exists and in that existence man defines himself and the world in his own subjectivity and wanders between choice freedom and existential angst.existentialism 
25	in the case of dostyevsky it is important to remember that novels such as crime punishment are seen very much as covering issues pertinent to existential philosophy while also refuting the validity of the claims of existentialism notably the superman theory advocated by nietzsche. throughout crime and punishment we see the protagonist raskolnikoff and his character develop away from existential ideas and beliefs in favour of more traditionally christian ones. 
25	a major existential movement in cinema was launched by the advent of french new wave cinema in the 1960s. landmark films during this period were breathless directed by jean-luc godard and written by francois truffaut. truffaut released his masterpiece the  blows in the same year. both godard and truffaut would go on to become flagbearers of existentialist cinema and produce notable films like alphaville bande a part stolen kisses and bed and board. 
25	the term expected value can be misleading. it must not be confused with the most probable value. the expected value is in general not a typical value that the random variable can take on. it is often helpful to interpret the expected value of a random variable as the long-run average value of the variable over many independent repetitions of an experitment. 
25	there is however no one single theory that can account for all of the specific extinctions. although one theory may explain the mass extinctions on land it may not account for all of the extinctions in marine conditions. the only theory that accounts for most of the extictions is the gamma ray theory. this would explain the selective extinctions and also would explain mass speciation which follows mass ectinctions. the radiation causes manipulations in dna and rna which lead to the sudden development of new species and also the sudden dissappearence of previous species. 
25	at present there seems to be massive controversy over the existence of aliens that have visited the earth and technology has been acquired by the u.s. military. on wednesday may 9th  over twenty military intelligence government corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the national press club in washington dc to establish the reality of ufos or extraterrestrial vehicles extraterrestrial life forms and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. the weight of this first-hand testimony along with supporting government documentation and other evidence will establish without any doubt the reality of these phenomena according to dr. steven m. greer director of the disclosure project which hosted the event. it is said that  catalogued varieties of alien life forms have visited the earth since the start of the research into this phenomenon. the disclosure project is a nonprofit research project working to fully disclose the facts about ufos extraterrestrial intelligence and classified advanced energy and propulsion systems. the disclosure project have over  government military and intelligence community witnesses testifying to their direct personal first hand experience with ufos ets et technology and the cover-up that keeps this information secret. for videos on the press national press club in washington: 
25	according to hindu scriptures there are innumerable universe created by the supreme personality of godhead to facilitate the fulfillment of the separated desires of innumerable living entities. however the purpose of such creations is to bring back the deluded souls to correct understanding about the purpose of life. apart from the innumerable universes which are material there is also the existence of unlimited spiritual world where the purified living entities live with perfect conception about life and ultimate reality. the life of these purified beings is centered around loving devotional services to supreme personality of godhead. the spiritually aspiring saints and devotees as well as thoughful men of material world have been getting guidance and help from these purified living entities of spiritual world from time immemorial.
