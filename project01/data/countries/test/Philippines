12	an electronic device for increasing the amplitude of electrical signals used chiefly in sound reproduction. device that responds to a small input signal voltage current or power and delivers a larger output signal that contains the essential waveform features of the input signal. amplifiers of various types are widely used in such electronic equipment as radio and television receivers high-fidelity audio equipment and computers. amplifying action can be provided by electromechanical devices e.g. transformers and generators and vacuum tubes but most electronic systems now employ solid-state microcircuits as amplifiers. such an integrated circuit consists of many thousands of transistors and related devices on a single tiny silicon chip. printed circuit board pcb  it is depend what is the circuit to make. it is mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components using conductive tracks pads and other features from copper sheets laminated into a non-conductive substrate. ic integrated circuit teab  this ic is  pins and those pins have different pin configurations capacitors v  mf  capacitor is an electronic component that has ability to store voltage in a form of electrostatic field this is connected to pins   capacitors v  mf  capacitor is an electronic component that has ability to store voltage in a form of electrostatic field this is connected to pin   v nf  it is connected before the speaker resistor k ohms  it is an electronic component that has an ability to oppose current or voltage this is become the input of the speaker. resistor .k ohms  it is an electronic component that has an ability to oppose current or voltage connected into  v nf. resistor  ohms  it is an electronic component that has an ability to oppose current or voltage connected into potentiometer bk ohms  adjusting knob for clockwise and counter-clockwise light emitting diode led  it is for light signal. vbattery  battery will be a supply or power to an amplifier. is a device consisting of one or more electrochemical cells that convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy. each cell contains a positive terminal or anode and a negative terminal or cathode. electrolytes allow ions to move between the electrodes and terminals which allows current to flow out of the battery to perform work. the first step is making a schematic diagram and then drills the hole for each component. put them together and solder it to connect all electronic components. when the starts to connects the electrons flow to the component then capacitor start to store volts in there electrostatic field that can vary more volts to another circuit that connected to other side. amplifiers works as an enhancement to the sound of the audio speaker system it is hook up too. the input signal is taken in by the amplifier and the output is the process of energy transmissions an amplifier doesn't convert a signal the way a transformer does. it increases the power. but it does this because it has a power input. so it uses the power from its power input to boost the signal that it receives on the signal input. again no energy is created. if you use an amplifier without plugging it in to a power source it won't do anything. submitted by: aaron paul besalez submitted to: oliver durumpili instructor in english ii

includes the vertebrates together with several closely related invertebrates. they are united by having at some time in their life cycle a notochord a hollow dorsal nerve cord pharyngeal slits an

hemichordata have been presented as a fourth chordate subphylum but they are now usually treated as a separate phylum. urochordate larvae have a notochord and a nerve cord but these are lost in adulthood. cephalochordates have a notochord and a nerve cord but no brain or specialist sense organs and a very simple circulatory system. craniates are the only sub-phylum whose members have skulls. in all craniates except for hagfish the dorsal hollow nerve cord has been surrounded with cartilaginous or bony vertebrae and the notochord generally reduced hence hagfish are not regarded as vertebrates. the chordates and three sister the hemichordata the echinodermata and the xenoturbellida make up the deuterostomes one of the two which encompass all fairly complex animals. attempts to work out the evolutionary relationships of the chordates have produced several hypotheses but the current consensus is that chordates are monophyletic in other words contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor which is itself a chordate and that craniates nearest relatives are cephalochordates. all of the earliest chordate fossils have been found in the early cambrian chengjiang fauna and include two species that are regarded as fish which implies that these are vertebrates. because the fossil record of chordates is poor only molecular phylogenetics offers a reasonable prospect of dating their emergence. however the use of molecular phylogeneticss for dating evolutionary transitions is controversial. it has also proved difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates. attempts to produce evolutionary phylogenetic trees give results that differ from traditional class because several of those classes are not monophyletic.

chordates are reduced fish or lancelet-like specimens from the cambrian. most speculations about their origin fit into one or more of these categories:  a sediment-dwelling worm-like animal that evolved a flatter body fins for swimming.  a sessile tubular filter-feeder that evolved into a free-swimming animal via usage of fins. tunicates considered a chordate are sessile filter feeders that have a tadpole-like larvae.  a drifting or swimming larva of some other kind of animal that eventually retained its swimming features into adulthood. the notochord's stiffness in many chordates may have evolved to facilitate the effectiveness of alternating muscle contractions for swimming in s-shaped movements. in other words in order to bend the body a muscle needs a rigid structure to pull against and a notochord at least before spines is the main structure to provide this. lack of a stiff body part would merely result in the shorting of the animal during muscle contractions instead of the bending motions needed for swimming. the following schema is from the third edition of vertebrate palaeontology palaeontology.ltrefgtbenton m.j. . vertebrate palaeontology third edition. blackwell

chordates phylum chordata are a group of animals that includes the vertebrates together with several closely related invertebrates. they are united by having at some time in their life cycle a notochord a hollow dorsal nerve cord pharyngeal slits an endostyle and a post-anal tail. the phylum chordata consists of three subphyla: urochordata represented by tunicates cephalochordata represented by lanceletsand craniata which includes the hemichordata have been presented as a fourth chordate subphylum but they are now usually treated as a separate phylum. urochordate larvae have a notochord and a nerve cord but these are lost in adulthood. cephalochordates have a notochord and a nerve cord but no brain or specialist sense organs and a very simple circulatory system. craniates are the only sub-phylum whose members have skulls. in all craniates except for hagfish the dorsal hollow nerve cord has been surrounded with cartilaginous or bony vertebrae and the notochord generally reduced hence hagfish are not regarded as vertebrates. the chordates and three sister the hemichordata the echinodermata and the xenoturbellida make up the deuterostomes one of the two which encompass all fairly complex animals. attempts to work out the evolutionary relationships of the chordates have produced several hypotheses but the current consensus is that chordates are monophyletic in other words contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor which is itself a chordate and that craniates nearest relatives are cephalochordates. all of the earliest chordate fossils have been found in the early cambrian chengjiang fauna and include two species that are regarded as fish which implies that these are vertebrates. because the fossil record of chordates is poor only molecular phylogenetics offers a reasonable prospect of dating their emergence. however the use of molecular phylogeneticss for dating evolutionary transitions is controversial. it has also proved difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates. attempts to produce evolutionary phylogenetic trees give results that differ from traditional class because several of those classes are not monophyletic. as a result vertebrate classification is in a state of flux. annotated image captionanatomy of the cephalochordate amphioxus  bulge in spinal cord brain  notochord

cel ko number lang wala name. parang ayaw ko pa nga sagutin ng una. pero ring ng ring so sinagot ko na si annie pala. akala nagbibiro lang sya kagabi sa mall sa mga nangyari. nagtaka ako paano nya nalaman yung number ko. kinuha nya daw sa friend ko. natuwa naman ako dahil naramdaman ko talaga gusto nya ako. sabi nya nalaman nya nacancel yung subject ko ngayon at wala na ako pasok. tinanong nya ako kung pwede ko daw ba sya dalawin sa kanila s bulacan di ko na lang sasabihin kung saan sa bulacan kasi daw yung parents nya eh nasa baguio sila lang ng katulong ang nandoon. so pumayag naman ako. ilan oras lang eh nasa bulacan na ako sa kanto ng lugar na sinabi nya sa akin eh nandoon na sya talaga hinihintay nya ako. habang papunta kami sa bahay nila eh nakaholding hands kami. grabe sa daan pa lang eh iniimagin ko na yung mangyayari pagdating sa bahay nila. pagdating sa bahay nila obvious na wala tao so tinawag nya yung katulong para mamalengke ang dami nya pinabili para sigurado di agad makakauwi yung katulong nila. pagsara pa lang ng gate ng bahay nila naghalikan na kami sa sala nila grabe hayok na hayok kami sa bawat isa halos makagat ko na ang malambot na lips ni annie. nang hahawakan ko na yung suso nya para lamasin eh inawat nya ako  doon daw kami sa room nya at baka may makakita sa amin. so pagdating ng room ni annie naghalikan na naman kami ng sobra di na ako makapagpigil na makita at madede ang malaki nya suso. so dali dali ko natanggal ang damit nya at ang bra nya nanglaki ang mata ko sa tumambad sa akin napakaputi ng suso nya tayong tayo at pink na pink ang utong ni annie. naisip ko napakaswerte ko naman at makakantot ko si annie. di na ako nagsayang ng oras sinunggaban ko agad yung utong ni annie. sinuso ko na parang sanggol n gutom na gutom. habang yung isang kamay ko eh naglalaro sa kabilang suso nya. napapaliyad si annie sa sarap ooohhhhh aaaaaaahhhh ang galing mo pala magromansa peter kala ko pa naman eh torpe ka at mahiyain. sige pa peter ang sarap susuhin mo pa ang suso ko grabe basa na yata ang puke ko ang sabi ni annie sa akin nang tumagal dahan dahan ko naman binaba yung mga halik ko sa puson nya halos di nya malaman kung ano gagawin nya sa sobrang sarap na dulot ng dila ko. di nagtagal tinanggal ko na rin yung mini skirt at panty ni annie napalunok ako sa akin nakita super tambok ng puke ni annie at mamula mula ang pisngi ng puke nya. di na ako nakapagtiis sinibasib ko agad ng halik at dila yung matambok nya puke napaungol n naman si annie habang tinatamaan ng dila ko ang clitoris nya.  shit peter lalabasan na naman yata ako ang galing mo talaga sige pa dilaan mo pa ang puke ko di nagtagal nalasahan ko yung malagkit na likido lumabas sa puke ni annie. bgla sya tumayo akala ko tapos na yon pala sya naman daw ang magtatrabaho. so hinalikan nya ako sa dibdib talaga makukuryente ka sa sobrang sarap dumila ng katawan ni annie marahil libog na libog na rin sya kaya tinanggal nya na agad yung pantalon at brief ko nagulat sya sa sobrang laki ng titi ko sabi nya baka di sya makapasok ng  week kapag kinantot ko sya. sa laki ng titi ko eh sigurado kakailanganin nya magpagaling ng puke. sabi ko wag sya magalala at dadahan dahanin ko at sisiguraduhin ko madulas ang puke nya bago ko ipasok yung titi ko sa puke nya. nilaro nya muna ang titi ko ng palad nya at ng tumagal eh sinubo nya yung titi ko kahit kalahati lng ng titi ko ang naisusubo nya eh talagang parang lalabasan na ako ang init kasi ng bibig ni annie. sige na peter ipasok mo n yung titi mo sa puke ko kantutin mo na ako peter. pero dahan dahanin mo lang peter sa pagpasok first time ko lang peter nagulat ako sa sinabi nya di ko akalain na virgin pa nga si annie akala ko eh binibiro nya lang ako. so dahan dahan ko kinakadyot yung titi ko papasok s puke ni annie ang hirap ipasok ng titi ko sa puke nya marahil sa laki n rin ng titi ko. ilan bayo ko eh nakagawa na rin ako ng butas at dahan dahan ko naipasok at ulo ng titi ko sa puke ni anniepantasya.com  pinoy sex stories collection. aarayyyyyyyy ko peter masakit pls dahan dahan lang. kaya dinahan dahan ko naman habang bumabaon yung titi ko sa puke nya eh tinitignan ko sya eye to

ko narinig sa kanya n mahal nya ako kaya hinalikan ko sya sa lips sabi ko onting tiis isasagad ko yung titi ko sa loob ng puke nya kaya bumayo ako ng sobrang lakas para maipasok na lahat ng titi ko sa puke ni annie. aaaaaaaaarrrrrrraaaaaaaaayyyy sigaw ni annie. napakalmot sya sa likod ko medyo masakit yung kalmot nya pero balewala yon sa sarap ng nararamdaman ko ng bumaon ng buo ang mataba at mahabang titi ko sa puke ni annie. so hinayaan ko muna nakabaon yung titi ko sa loob ng puke nya para mawala yung kirot na nararamdaman nya. nang sa tingin ko eh ok n sya dahan dahan ko hinugot at binaon yung titi ko sa puke nya. sa una mabagal hanggang bumibilis ng onti. aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh oooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh peter nawala na yung sakit ang sarap na. kantutin mo pa ako peter ang sarap

believed to be on the petrucall river and was generally populated by people around  bce. by  bce descendants of early arbingrian started the civilization which was characterized by early developments of arbingrian religion. on around  wikipedia:anno seven nation-states started to sprung up collectively over the area and was in dominance and peace for at least four hundred years. on  disgruntled members of the unfortunate soblaja family overthrown in the most powerful state of lorinthia and conquered the remaining kingdoms. on  port people broke up a revolution which was formally known as arbingrian revolution of arbingrian revolution which successfully disenthroned the first house of king and divided the present-day arbingria into four independent republics. on  solomon pampshire reunited the kingdom and reinstalled the broken ninth heir apparent to the throne thus started the second house of reading or second house of dynasty. on  second arbingrian revolution flared and replaced the turingchel by the lorinthia-linked house of the modern republic was technically established in  when the constitution of  was ratified giving the political power to the prime minister of minister and renaming the country as a constitutional monarchy. in history arbingria was initially a state being replaced only by military government during the lorinthia era. this is the main reason as what many historians and sociologists point out why the present arbingrian government focuses on religion whereas main concern was general administration. in  several government agencies were dissolved combined and created creating the comprehensive list of generalized and more accurate fifteen ministries in every field and which complexed into eighteen ministries. arbingria is known for its many wikipedia:world heritage sites where most of them includes historic monuments natural preserve parks and ethnographic reservation sites. the country's capital is sterling-newbury which was essentially created in  from the defunct adjacent cities of sterling fantry defunct fantry and newberry state. on the other hand largest city is the arebit holn. sterling-newbury and arebit holn are both located on the province of new port castles. image:arbingria political map with map of arbingria showing regions and states. arbingia is consisted of  states  of them are located in clusters in

jointly ruled by the prime minister and the parliament. the monarch institution  image:royal coat of arms of of coat of arms: coat of arms officially used by louis vii in  until present. through history dynasties used different coat of arms and emblems. though ceremonial in nature the monarch institution is the greatly established and has firm foundation through other institution on arbingrian politics. the highest noble on the monarch institution is the monarch of or queen who assumes the title king of the arbingian republic emperor of nashbor islands and rumpard villegas and lord protector of new canatuly and gonzales. the is traditionally the first child on the apparent royal family which was changed efficiently in  when there was no male in the family to become the heir apparent. usually the king opens the parliament of session and gives the royal parole among lifetime prisoners. apart from the absence of the prime minister the king is the second commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the republic of forces and is the most respected person in the monarch institution. in ceremony and practice the king exercises sovereignty to the mainland nation as well as on the country's territories. image:arbingria imperial of emblem: officially used in  the imperial emblem was first iterated by joseph iv emperor of iv. even in other nations emperors are considered the absolute ruler the emperor of or empress is also a ceremonial figurehead that was usually though to become a symbol of unity and peace among arbingrian states. the emperor which must be a member of the arbingrian nobility and holds the title of a duke or duchess or count or countess. the emperor could also be the king or queen on its reign pre-regnal period or on post-reign per abdication of the throne. the emperor could also be the prince or princess or arbingia. in general an emperor must be a member of the any designated royal family or household at least. in contrast with the dynastic line of the kings the emperor is elected by the electoral college for the emperor and with an initial term of six years. if ever the emperor's term coincided with the death of the reigning the emperor's reign will also be substantially ended wherefore the replacing emperor will have the same start of reign with the new monarch. a previously elected emperor is not subjected to re-election despite its given credentials as cleared by the imperial election order of  when richard viii was elected four times r.  b.  d.  until promulgation of the law. next in line are the dukes or duchesses and count or countesses. significantly before the creation of the modern republic the dukes ruled provinces as well as cities. dukes ruling the province or group of provinces were called dukes in itself but ruling dukes on cities are called archdukes. if the of arbingria holds the title of a duke they are called grand archduke or grand archduchess. on the other had counts governed mainly municipalities. consequently if the of arbingria holds the title of a count they are called grand before until  villages were ruled by the viscounts or viscountess and barons or baroness though there is no clear distinction between the titles of vicountry and baronny. today dukes and counts has the same ceremonial powers their traditional roles were replaced by modern-day state governors city and municipality mayors. the monarch institution has its own congress of ministers called as the royal ministry. the offices that occupy the royal ministry is congruent to the offices by the cabinet ministries and the highest member of the royal ministry tends to be the royal minister which is also the head of the ministry of the royal family in the cabinet. before  the present prime minister's office and the present royal minister's office is only one where the royal minister tends only to give advices to the king. after the ratification of the constitution and transformation from absolute to constitutional monarchy the royal minister's office was dissolved giving way to the modern prime ministerial office. then by late  the royal ministry was officially re-created patterned after the newly-formed cabinet. image:ferdinand joseph jospeh dorset nationalist union from upper clayvania is the 49th prime minister of arbingria. he assumed office in january  . the highest political office in the land is the prime minister of minister's office. if the king and the emperor are considered to be the heads of state and symbols for peace and unity the prime minister serves as the head of government. in short the prime minister is the chief executive and also heads the parliamentary branch. falling under the prime minister's office is the vice prime minister of prime minister or vice premier. the vice premier counteracts and checks the balances of the national government. he is second of the line in succession in case the prime minister dies resigned or removed from the office. the prime minister is elected through representative voting by a group of representatives from each state amongst a specific time which varies. on the other hand the vice premier may be a member of the party in which the prime minister belongs or a senator elected by the parliament. under these offices there are three chambers that making up the parliament of arbingria and another attached chamber that members the parliament only under special circumstances. the first is the cabinet ministries of ministries which was expected to be an intervening chamber except for lawmaking and adjustments to the constitution. currently there are eighteen ministries emerged from the original  ministries fixed by the  general rehabilitation act:  ministry of agriculture and reform  ministry of civil services and national utilities  ministry of education  ministry of the executive  ministry of federal affairs and local administration  ministry of foreign affairs and international communications  ministry of health and humanitarian services  ministry of justice  ministry of labor and employment  minister to the parliament  ministry of national defense  ministry of natural resources and wildlife preservation  ministry of public waterworks and organization  office of the royal minister  ministry of science development  ministry of trade industry and finance  ministry of transportation and communication  ministry of tourism next is the national senate assembly of arbingria. the senate is headed by the senate president chosen among the  senators from each states and territories. each state has its own state senator elected through direct voting and has a tenure of six years. on the other hand the territorial senator was not only elected through direct voting but candidacy was approved by the commonwealth. the senate is considered to be the the upper chamber of the parliament. the third chamber is the house of representatives of arbingria. it is composed of  members which has a tenure of three years. the head of the house is the house speaker which was also chosen among the congressmen. each state has its own set of  representatives voted directly whereas the territories has six each. the house on the other hand is the lower chamber of the parliament. the fourth free but attached chamber is the council of states. it is a collection of all the states and territories of arbingria which has limited to one representative per cities can also have their own representatives but must pass the council's standards. the council has its own sessions which may discuss issues concerning federal affairs and when called or requested to be called by the parliament may intervene with the lawmaking affairs too. second branch of the government is the judicial branch or judiciary. it is headed by the lord chief justice which was appointed by the king upon recommendation of the prime minister and parliament. he essentially heads the supreme court of court and functions as the main translator of the constitution. under the supreme court is the court of tax and legal appeals court of religious affairs and the federal court circuits.

12	terrestrial ecosystems are found everywhere apart from water bodies. they are broadly classified into: these are the ecosystems where abundance of flora plants is seen and they have a large number of organisms living in relatively small areas. therefore the density of life in forest ecosystems is very high. any small change in the ecosystem can affect the whole balance and collapse the ecosystem. you can see wonderful diversity in the fauna of these ecosystems too. they are again divided into few types. tropical evergreen forest: tropical forests which receive an average rainfall of  to  inches in a year. these forests are marked by dense vegetation comprising of tall trees with different levels. each level gives shelter to different kinds of animals. tropical deciduous forest: dense bushes and shrubs rule here along with broad levels of trees. this type of forests is found in many parts of the world and large variety of flora and fauna are found here. temperate evergreen forest: these have very few number of trees but ferns and mosses make up fro them. trees have spiked leaves to minimize transpiration. temperate deciduous forest: this forest is found in the moist temperate regions with sufficient rainfall. winters and summers are well defined and with trees shedding their leaves during winter. taiga: situated just south of the arctic regions taiga is distinguished by evergreen conifers. while the temperature is subzero for almost six months the rest of the year it is buzzing with insects and migratory birds. desert ecosystems are found in regions receiving an annual rainfall of less than cm. they occupy around  percent of all land on the planet. due to very high temperature intense sunlight and low water availability flora and fauna are very poorly developed and scarce. vegetation is mainly bushes shrubs few grasses and rarely trees. leaves and stems of these plants are modified to conserve water. the best known desert plants are the succulents like spiny leaved cacti. animal life includes insects reptiles birds camels all of whom are adapted to the xeric desert conditions. grasslands are found in both temperate and tropical regions of the world but the ecosystems are slightly varying. this area mainly comprises of grasses with very little amount of shrubs and trees. main vegetation is grasses legumes and plants belonging to composite family. many grazing animals herbivores and insectivores are found in grasslands. two main types of grasslands ecosystems are: . savanna: these tropical grasslands are seasonally dry with few individual trees. they support large number of grazers and predators. . prairies: this is temperate grassland. it is completely devoid of trees and large shrubs. prairies can be categorized as tall grass mixed grass and short grass prairie. mountain lands provide a scattered but diverse array of habitats in which a large range of plants and animals are found. at higher altitudes harsh environmental conditions generally prevail and only treeless alpine vegetation is found. the animals living here have thick fur coats fro prevention from cold and hibernate in winter months. lower slopes commonly are covered by coniferous forests. an aquatic ecosystem is an ecosystem located in a body of water. it comprises aquatic fauna flora and the properties of water too. there are two types of aquatic ecosystems marine and freshwater. marine ecosystems are the largest ecosystems with coverage of nearly  of the earth's surface and containing  of the planet's water. the water in marine ecosystems has salts and minerals dissolved in them in high amounts. different divisions of marine ecosystems are: oceanic: the relatively shallow part of the ocean that lies over the continental shelf. profundal: bottom or deep water. inter-tidal: the area between high and low tides. hydrothermal vents-where chemosynthetic bacteria form the food base. many types of organisms are found in marine ecosystems including brown algae dinoflagellates corals cephalopods echinoderms and sharks. in contrast to the marine ecosystem freshwater ecosystems only cover . of the earth's surface and contain . of its total water. there are three basic types of freshwater ecosystems: lentic: still or slow-moving water like pools ponds and lakes. lotic: fast-moving water like streams and rivers. wetlands: places where the soil is saturated or inundated for at least some time. these ecosystems are home to amphibians reptiles and almost  of worlds fish species. faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. 
12	interrelationship in an ecosystem a predator requires prey to survive showing the interrelationship between the two different animal types. without the prey the predator wouldn't be able to survive. the animal that fills the role of the prey usually reproduces more often than that of the predator to ensure that they don't die out. commensalism relates to the interaction of animals that neither helps nor hinders them meaning that this stage is relatively unimportant in regards to the other stages in the ecosystem that are to do with interrelationship. parasitism relates to the way that some parasites feed off the blood of other animals to stay alive. it would die if it didn't actually live on the body of the other animal as blood is its only food source. mutualism relates to the process in which some species aid the life of another with both forms benefiting. examples of this include most birds and plants as they pollinate different plants and whatnot allowing for the plants to grow and spread giving other animals food to feed from. some species are completely interdependent with each other because of this meaning that in order to survive both have to fit in with their chosen requirements. competition is one of the more straight forward aspects of interrelationship in regards to the ecosystem. it relates to the fact that some species fight for their own habitats and food sources meaning that the fittest of the two species will prevail and leave the other species slowly becoming extinct. amensalism relates to how some species can influence the lives of others without actively doing anything usually just because they exist. this can mean that one plant may influence the life of another as its existence means that more plants have are available for being consumed meaning that the original plant has more chance of survival.

12	 in physics the electromagnetic force is the force that the electromagnetic field exerts on electrically charged particles. it is the electromagnetic force that holds electrons and nuclei together in atoms and which hold atoms together to make molecules. the electromagnetic force operates via the exchange of messenger particles called photons. the exchange of messenger particles between bodies acts to create the perceptual force whereby instead of just pushing or pulling particles apart the exchange changes the character of the particles that swap them.
 originally electricity and magnetism were thought of as two separate forces. this view changed however with the publication of james clerk maxwell's  treatise on electricity and magnetism in which the interactions of positive and negative charges where shown to be regulated by one force. there are four main effects resulting from these interactions which have been clearly demonstrated by experiment:
 electric charges attract or repel one another with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them: unlike charges attract like ones repel.
 magnetic poles or states of polarization at individual points attract or repel one another in a similar way and always come in pairs: every north pole is yoked to a south pole.
 an electric current in a wire creates a circular magnetic filed around the wire its direction depending on that of the current.
 a current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved towards or away from a magnetic or a magnet is moved towards or away from it the direction of current depending on that of the movement.
 all of these effects are explained beautifully with maxwell's field equations. magnets for example cause attraction or repulsion due to congruent or geometric alignment of spins.
 the electromagnetic force is one of the four fundamental forces. the other fundamental forces are the strong nuclear force which holds atomic nuclei together the weak nuclear force which causes certain forms of radioactive decay and the force. all other forces are ultimately derived from these fundamental forces.
 the electromagnetic force is the one responsible for practically all the phenomena one encounters in daily life with the exception of gravity. roughly speaking all the forces involved in interactions between atoms can be traced to the electromagnetic force acting on the electrically charged protons and electrons inside the atoms. this includes the forces we experience in pushing or pulling ordinary material objects which come from the intermolecular forces between the individual molecules in our bodies and those in the objects. it also includes all forms of phenomena which arise from interactions between electron orbitals.

12	the use of symbols to denote numbers called variables is used in algebra to make generalizations about mathematics. this is useful because: it allows arithmetical equations and inequalities to be stated as laws such as a  b  b  a for all a and b and thus is the first step to the systematic study of the properties of the real number system. it allows reference to numbers which are not known. in the context of a problem a variable may represent a certain value which is not yet known but which may be found through the formulation and manipulation of equations. it allows the exploration of mathematical relationships between quantities such as if you sell x tickets then your profit will be x   dollars. in elementary algebra an expression may contain numbers variables and arithmetical operations. these are usually written by convention with higher-power terms on the left see polynomial a few examples are: in more advanced algebra an expression may also include elementary functions.

mathematics it is important that the value of an expression is always computed the same way. therefore it is necessary to compute the parts of an expression in a particular order known as the order of operations. the standard order of operations is expressed in the following chart. a common mnemonic device for remembering this order is pemdas. generally in elementary algebra the use of brackets often called parentheses and their simple applications will be taught at most of the schools in the world. an equation is the claim that two expressions are equal. some equations are true for all values of the involved variables such as a  b  b  a such equations are called identities. conditional equations are true for only some values of the involved variables: x    . the values of the variables which make the equation true are the solutions of the equation and can be found through equation solving. edit properties of equality the relation of equality  is reflexive: a  a symmetric: if a  b then b  a transitive: if a  b and b  c then a  c. the relation of equality  has the property that if a  b and c  d then a  c  b  d and ac  bd that if a  b then a  c  b  c that if two symbols are equal then one can be substituted for the other. edit properties of inequality the relation of inequality  has the property of transivity: if a  b and b  c then a  c that if a  b and c  d then a  c  b  d that if a  b and c   then ac  bc that if a  b and c   then bc  ac. a typical algebra problem.the following sections lay out examples of some of the types of alegbraic equations you might encounter. edit linear equations in one variable main article: linear equation the simplest equations to solve are linear equations that have only one variable. they contain only constant numbers and a single variable without an exponent. for example: the central technique is add subtract multiply or divide both sides of the equation by the same number in order to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. once the variable is isolated the other side of the equation is the value of the variable. for example by subtracting  from both sides in the equation above: dividing both sides by : simplifies to the solution: main article: quadratic equation quadratic equations can be expressed in the form ax  bx  c   where a is not zero if it were zero then the equation would not be quadratic but linear. because of this a quadratic equation must contain the term ax which is known as the quadratic term. hence a   and so we may divide by a and rearrange the equation into the standard form where p  and q  solving this by a process known as completing the square leads to the quadratic formula. quadratic equations can also be solved using factorization the reverse process of which is expansion but for two linear terms is sometimes denoted foiling. as an example of factoring: which is the same thing as it follows from the zero-product property that either x   or x   are the solutions since precisely one of the factors must be equal to zero. all quadratic equations will have two solutions in the complex number system but need not have any in the real number system. for example has no real number solution since no real number squared equals . sometimes a quadratic equation has a root of multiplicity  such as: for this equation  is a root of multiplicity . edit exponential and logarithmic equations an exponential equation is an equation of the form ax  b for a   which has solution when b  . elementary algebraic techniques are used to rewrite a given equation in the above way before arriving at the solution. for example if then by subtracting  from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by  we obtain a logarithmic equation is an equation of the form logax  b for a   which has solution then by adding  to both sides of the equation followed by dividing both sides by  we get from which we obtain a radical equation is an equation of the form  a for m n integers which has solution if m is odd and solution if m is even and a  . for example if whence either x       or x      . edit system of linear equations main article: system of linear equations in the case of a system of linear equations like for instance two equations in two variables it is often possible to find the solutions of both variables that satisfy both equations. an example of solving a system of linear equations is by using the elimination method: multiplying the terms in the second equation by : adding the two equations together to get: since the fact that x   is known it is then possible to deduce that y   by either of the original two equations by using  instead of x the full solution to this problem is then note that this is not the only way to solve this specific system y could have been solved before x. edit second method of finding a solution another way of solving the same system of linear equations is by substitution. an equivalent for y can be deduced by using one of the two equations. using the second equation: subtracting x from each side of the equation: and multiplying by : using this y value in the first equation in the original system: adding  on each side of the equation: using this value in one of the equations the same solution as in the previous method is obtained. note that this is not the only way to solve this specific system in this case as well y could have been solved before x. edit other types of systems of linear equations in the above example it is possible to find a solution. however there are also systems of equations which do not have a solution. an obvious example would be: the second equation in the system has no possible solution. therefore this system can't be solved. however not all incompatible systems are recognized at first sight. as an example the following system is studied: when trying to solve this for example by using the method of substitution above the second equation after adding x on both sides and multiplying by  results in: and using this value for y in the first equation: no variables are left and the equality is not true. this means that the first equation can't provide a solution for the value for y obtained in the second equation. there are also systems which have multiple or infinite solutions in opposition to a system with a unique solution meaning two unique values for x and y for example: isolating y in the second equation: and using this value in the first equation in the system: the equality is true but it does not provide a value for x. indeed one can easily verify by just filling in some values of x that for any x there is a solution as long as y  x  . there are infinite solutions for this system. edit over and underdetermined systems systems with more variables than the number of linear equations do not have a unique solution. an example of such a system is such a system is called underdetermined when trying to find a solution one or more variables can only be expressed in relation to the other variables but cannot be determined numerically. incidentally a system with a greater number of equations than variables in which necessarily some equations are sums or multiples of others is called overdetermined. edit relation between solvability and multiplicity given any system of linear equations there is a relation between multiplicity and solvability. if one equation is a multiple of the other or more generally a sum of multiples of the other equations then the system of linear equations is undetermined meaning that the system has infinitely many solutions. example: has solutions xy such as   ..  .. and so on. when the multiplicity is only partial meaning that for example only the left hand sides of the equations are multiples while the right hand sides are not or not by the same number then the system is unsolvable. for example in the second equation yields that x  y  which is in contradiction with the first equation. such a system is also called inconsistent in the language of linear algebra. when trying to solve a system of linear equations it is generally a good idea to check if one equation is a multiple of the other. if this is precisely so the solution cannot be uniquely determined. if this is only partially so the solution does not exist. this however does not mean that the equations must be multiples of each other to have a solution as shown in the sections above in other words: multiplicity in a system of linear equations is not a necessary condition for solvability.

12	catholic church leaders among others began speaking against euthanasia as a violation the sanctity of life. nevertheless owing to its principle of double effect catholic moral theology did leave room for shortening life with pain-killers and what would could be characterized as passive euthanasia. on the other hand judges were often lenient in mercy-killing cases.  during this period prominent proponents euthanasia included glanville williams the sanctity of life and the criminal law and clergyman joseph fletcher morals and medicine. by the 1960s, advocacy for a right-to-die approach to voluntary euthanasia increased. a key turning point in the debate over voluntary euthanasia and physician assisted dying at least in the united states was the public furor over the case of karen ann quinlan. the quinlan case paved the way for legal protection of voluntary passive euthanasia. in  california legalized living wills other states soon followed suit. in  dr. jack kevorkian a michigan physician became infamous for encouraging and assisting people in committing suicide which resulted in a michigan law against the practice in . kevorkian was tried and convicted in  for a murder displayed on television. in  the supreme court approved the use of non-aggressive euthanasia. in  oregon voters approved doctor-assisted suicide and the supreme court allowed such laws in . the bush administration failed in its attempt to use drug law to stop oregon in . in  non-aggressive euthanasia was permitted in texas. in  the netherlands decriminalized doctor-assisted suicide and in  restrictions were loosened. during that year was approved in belgium. australia's northern territory approved a euthanasia bill in  but that was overturned by australias federal parliament in . most

voluntary euthanasia since world war ii the debate over euthanasia in western countries has centered on voluntary euthanasia ve within regulated health care systems. in some cases judicial decisions legislation and regulations have made ve an explicit option for patients and their guardians. proponents and critics of such ve policies offer the following reasons for and against official voluntary euthanasia policies: edit reasons given for voluntary euthanasia:  choice: proponents of ve emphasize that choice is a fundamental principle for liberal democracies and free market systems.  quality of life: the pain and suffering a person feels during a disease even with pain relievers can be incomprehensible to a person who has not gone through it. even without considering the physical pain it is often difficult for patients to overcome the emotional pain of losing their independence.   economic costs and human resources: today in many countries there is a shortage of hospital space. the energy of doctors and hospital beds could be used for people whose lives could be saved instead of continuing the life of those who want to die which increases the general quality of care and shortens hospital waiting lists.  moral: some people consider euthanasia to be just another choice a person makes and for moral reasons against it to be undue influence by others.  pressure: all the arguments against voluntary euthanasia can be used by society to form a terrible and continuing psychological pressure on people to continue living for years against their better judgement. one example of this pressure is the risky and painful methods that those who genuinely wish to die would otherwise need to use such as hanging.  sociobiology: currently many if not most euthanasia proponents and laws tend to favor the dying or very unhealthy for access to euthanasia. however some highly controversial proponents claim that access should be even more widely available. for example from a sociobiological viewpoint genetic relatives may seek to keep an individual alive kin selection even against the individual's will. this would be especially so for individuals who are not actually dying anyway. more liberal voluntary euthanasia policies would empower the individual to counteract any such biased interest on the part of relatives. citation needed edit reasons given against voluntary euthanasia:  professional role: critics argue that ve could unduly compromise the professional roles of health care employees especially doctors. they point out that european physicians of previous centuries traditionally swore some variation of the hippocratic oath which in its ancient form excluded euthanasia: to please no one will i prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death.. however since the 1970s, this oath has largely fallen out of use.  moral: some people consider euthanasia of some or all types to be morally unacceptable. this view usually treats euthanasia to be a type of murder and voluntary euthanasia as a type of suicide the morality of the subject of active debate.  theological: euthanasia often has been rejected as a violation the sanctity of human life. specifically some christians argue human life ultimately belongs to god so that humans ought not make the choice to end life. orthodox judaism takes basically the same approach however it more open minded and does given certain circumstances allow for euthanasia be exercised under passive or non-aggressive means. accordingly some theologians and other religious thinkers consider ve and suicide generally as sinful acts i.e. unjustified killings.  feasibility of implementation: euthanasia can only be considered voluntary if a patient is mentally competent to make the decision i.e. has a rational understanding of options and consequences. competence can be difficult to determine or even define.  necessity: if there is some reason to believe the cause of a patient's illness or suffering is or will soon be curable the correct action is sometimes considered to be attempting to bring about a cure or engage in palliative care.  wishes of family: family members often desire to spend as much time with their loved ones as possible before they die. therefore the wishes of the family may outweigh the patient's right to control his own life.  consent under pressure: given the economic grounds for voluntary euthanasia ve critics of ve are concerned that patients may experience psychological pressure to consent to voluntary euthanasia rather than be a financial burden on their families.  even where health costs are mostly covered by public monies as in various european counties ve critics are concerned that hospital personnel would have economic incentive to advise or pressure people toward euthanasia consent. while ve proponents concede that personal even socialized economic costs may add to the motivations for consent they point out that health systems offer sufficient exceptions so as to relieve the pressure on hospital personnel.citation needed edit governmental religious and other non-governmental policymaking during the 20th century efforts to change government policies on euthanasia have met limited success in western countries. country policies are described below in alphabetical order followed by the exceptional case of the netherlands. euthanasia policies have also been developed by a variety of ngos most notably medical associations and advocacy organizations. euthanasia was legalized in albania in  it was stated that any form of voluntary euthanasia was legal under the rights of the terminally ill act of passive euthanasia is considered legal should three or more family members consent to the decision. albania's policy has been controversial among life groups the catholic church but due to other more prominent countries also legalizing forms

12	caledflwch is vividly described in the mabinogion: :then they heard cador of earl of cornwall being summoned and saw him rise with arthur's sword in his hand with a design of two serpents on the golden hilt when the sword was unsheathed what was seen from the mouths of the two serpents was like two flames of fire so dreadful that it was not easy for anyone to look. at that the host settled and the commotion subsided and the earl returned to his tent. iddawg who is the man who brought arthur's sword? asks rhonabwy cadwr earl of cornwall tha man whose task it is to arm the king on the day of battle and conflict. the dream of rhonabwy from the mabinogion translated by jeffrey gantz. see here. several false etymologies have been proposed for the origin of the name excalibur like ex calibur cut-steel. 
12	excalibur features prominantly in modern fiction. its connection to the sovereignty of britain was an important part of rosemary sutcliff's novel sword at sunset and john boorman's film excalibur and it played a more mundane role in the  film king arthur arthur. many role-playing games such as the final fantasy series incorporate a weapon named excalibur usually as one of the top-tier items.

12	the lady of the lake calls the sword excalibur that is as to say as cut-steel.  first escalibor then to excalibur  in many versions excalibur's blade was engraved with words on opposite sides. on one side were the words take me up and on the other side cast me away. this prefigures its return into the water. cut-steel. one theory about the sword in the stone legend is that it stems from a scribal error. the latin word for stone is saxum very similar to saxon saxonum so it is possible that the story of arthur originally had him killing a saxon and taking his sword a symbol of victory but that during a later copying of the text a scribe mistakenly changed it to saxum. hence arthur pulled the sword from the saxon may have become arthur pulled the sword from the stone. however the sword in the stone has an analogue in some versions of the story of sigurd the norse proto-siegfried who draws his father sigmund's sword out of a tree where it is embedded. whether the same as the sword in the stone or not  the sword in the stone by t. h. white is bbased upon the beginning of le morte d'arthur'. many books like of avalon mabinogion with the addition of the engraved words in atlantean runes.  bernard cornwell calls the sword both caledflwch and excalibur in the warlord chronicles.  mary stewart calls the sword caliburn in her merlin trilogy and in the wicked day.

12	things in have is free to place meaning on what he she wants. this is in effect a meditational technigue employed by existential thinkers. whereby they shut down the everyday mind and watch where and what they place their onto. sartre concluded that consciousness changes when one is looked at. this look simply equates onto what other people think of me. people vaiously place meaning onto what other people think of rather than what they themselves think of themselves. this process of radically re-aligning this meaning from the look onto one's being is what leads to periods ofexistential angst. negative feelings are in fact what prevents people from placing meaning on their own freedom by attempting to avoid these feelings and limiting themselves in the everyday mind and being possessed in one form or another of he lookof the other. as existentialism looks at where people place their meaning compulsively. it believes that people will in fact make decisions based on what they have meaning on rather than what is rational. in fact it is only people who have meaning on rationality that will make rational decisions. as such common. this experience of meaning as meaning rather than meaning justified through rationality was consistent with all existential thinkers. keirkergaard saw rationality as a counter-reflective mechanism to anguish before oneself and fear of beingin the world. that is if i can believe that i am rational and everyone else is rational then i have nothing to fear and no reason to feal anguish about being free. sartre saw rationality as a form of bad faith. 
12	there are several methods of classifying exploits. the most common is by how the exploit contacts the vulnerable software. a remote exploit works over a network and exploits the security vulnerability without any prior access to the vulnerable system. a local exploit requires prior access to the vulnerable system and usually increases the privileges of the person running the exploit past those granted by the system administrator. exploits against client applications also exist usually consisting of modified servers that send an exploit if accessed with client application. exploits against client applications may also require some interaction with the user and thus may be used in combination with social engineering method. another classification is by the action against vulnerable system: unauthorized data access arbitrary code execution denial of service.many exploits are designed to provide superuser-level access to a computer system. however it is also possible to use several exploits first to gain low-level access then to escalate privileges repeatedly until one reaches root.normally a single exploit can only take advantage of a specific software vulnerability. often when an exploit is published the vulnerability is fixed through a patch and the exploit becomes obsolete for newer versions of the software. this is the reason why some blackhat hackers do not publish their exploits but keep them private to themselves or other hackers. such exploits are referred to as zero day exploits and to obtain access to such exploits is the primary desire of unskilled attackers often nicknamed script kiddies.citation needed
