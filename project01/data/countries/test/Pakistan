30	in mathematics binary operation is a calculation involving two operands in other words an operation whose arity is two. examples include the familiar arithmetic operations of addition subtraction multiplication and division. more precisely a binary operation on a set s is a binary relation that maps elements of the cartesian product s  s to s: if f is not a function but is instead a partial function it is called a partial operation. for instance division of real numbers is a partial function because one can't divide by zero: is not defined for any real a. note however that both in algebra and model theory the binary operations considered are defined on the whole of s times s . sometimes especially in computer science the term is used for any binary function. that f takes values in the same set s that provides its arguments is the property of closure. binary operations are the keystone of algebraic structures studied in abstract algebra: they form part of groups monoids semigroups rings and more. most generally a magma is a set together with any binary operation defined on it. many binary operations of interest in both algebra and formal logic are commutative or associative. many also have identity elements and inverse elements. typical examples of binary operations are the addition  and multiplication  of numbers and matrices as well as composition of functions on a single set. an example of an operation that is not commutative is subtraction . examples of partial operations that are not commutative include division exponentiation and super-exponentiation. binary operations are often written using infix notation such as a  b a  b a  b or by juxtaposition with no symbol ab rather than by functional notation of the form fa b. powers are usually also written without operator but with the second argument as superscript. binary operations sometimes use prefix or postfix notation dispenses with parentheses. prefix notation also called polish notation postfix notation also called reverse polish notation is probably more encountered

it's one of the big questions: are we alone on this blue marble or is there life elsewhere in the cosmos? to shed some light astronomers are searching for habitable worlds circling far-off stars. a team has now published updated evidence for a planet that could be the most earth-like yet. according to the us planetary habitability laboratory it would be the fifth potentially habitable world known outside our solar system. so what do we know about these five earth-like planets and how likely is it that they could support life? continue reading the main story  similarity to earth esi: .  minimum mass: . times that of earth  distance: . light-years the discovery of gliese g was announced in september  by a us-led team. but as soon as they made the announcement doubts began to surface. the team at the geneva observatory which had discovered all four other planets around the star gliese  failed to detect it in their own data. however the original discoverers of g have now published an analysis using a greater amount of data to provide more promising evidence for its existence. this would be significant because the earth similarity index esi devised by a team including dirk schulze-makuch from washington state university and abel mendez from the university of puerto rico upr in arecibo shows that gliese g is the most earth-like planet discovered to date. the esi measures characteristics of exoplanets on a scale from zero to one with one being identical to earth. accordingly the online habitable exoplanets catalog based at upr has decided to include it in their list of the most promising worlds to support life. like the other worlds in the catalogue gliese g orbits in a sweet spot around its star  the habitable zone or goldilocks zone  that is neither too hot nor too cold to allow for liquid water. it is just over twice the mass of earth and although the planet is closer to its parent star than is earth it receives about the same light flux a measure of the star's apparent brightness as our planet because gliese  is a red dwarf star and therefore dimmer than our own sun. steven vogt from university of california santa cruz us one of original discoverers said gliese g orbits squarely in the star's habitable zone at . au where liquid water on planetary surfaces is a distinct possibility. but it remains to be seen whether the new evidence will convince the doubters. new kid on the block continue reading the main story  similarity to earth esi: .  minimum mass: . times that of earth  distance:  light-years announced in february  by a team from the us carnegie insitution and germany's goettingen university gliese cc belongs to a class of planets known as super earths  a class of planet with a size in between that of rocky worlds like earth and mars and the gas giants like jupiter and saturn. roughly . times the mass of earth gliese cc takes  days to complete a single orbit of its star which is located just  light-years away. the exoplanet absorbs about as much energy from its star as earth does from the sun which means surface temperatures could be similar to earth's. this would allow for the presence on the planet's surface of liquid water  one of the pre-requisites for life. however astronomers say this cannot be confirmed without further information on the planet's atmosphere. nevertheless co-discoverer guillem anglada-escude has said of cc: this planet is the new best candidate to support liquid water and perhaps life as we know it. continue reading the main story  similarity to earth esi: .  mass: up to  times that of

the only confirmed world in the habitable zone around its parent star which is the same class  a g-type  as our sun though slightly cooler and smaller. with a radius . times that of earth kepler b is bigger than some others in the list of five. but its orbit of  days around a sun-like star resembles that of our own planet. astronomers do not yet know for sure whether it has a predominantly gaseous rocky or liquid composition. but to some its size suggests a composition closer to the gaseous neptune than to earth. at the time of its discovery exoplanet hunter geoff marcy from the university of california berkeley told the ap news agency that he would bet my telescope that there is no hard rocky surface to walk on. but this is not necessarily bad for its prospects for hosting biology: mission scientist natalie batalha said that if kepler b were mostly ocean with a small rocky core its not beyond the realm of possibility that life could exist in such an ocean. continue reading the

habitable zone. this means it is closer to venus than earth in the amount of energy it absorbs from its star. however that would not necessarily preclude the possibility of life. how hospitable the planet is may depend on how much cloud cover it has since clouds reflect solar radiation. its discoverers calculate that if hdb were to have more than  cloud cover on the same order as earth it could offset the planet's proximity to its star enough for water to stay liquid at the surface. however any life forms on hdb will have to be suited to very balmy conditions its going to be really muggy

udry. one of a system of five planets it is the immediate neighbour of gliese g. however gliese d orbits at a greater distance from its parent star on the colder outer fringe of the habitable zone. as a result sunlight on gliese d has about  the intensity that is does on mars. but computer simulations of the exoplanet's atmosphere suggest that under some scenarios greenhouse gases would allow surface temperatures to remain above c allowing water to stay liquid. indeed says dr udry the planet could even be covered by a large and deep ocean. since it is located only . light-years away  in the constellation libra  astronomers should be able to resolve some of these questions in the future with direct spectroscopic observations of the planet's atmosphere.

30	education vouchers in pakistan dr. allah bakhsh malik former managing director punjab education foundation  pef introduced education voucher scheme  evs in punjab especially in urban slums and poorest of the poor in . the initial study was sponsored by open society institute new york usa. professor henry m levin extended pro-bono services for the children of poor families from punjab.to ensure educational justice and avoid educational apartheid the government must ensure that the poorest of the poor have equal access to quality education. only then will future generations be able to escape from the vicious cycle of poverty and deprivation. in collaboration with the teachers college columbia university and the open society institute the pef designed the education voucher scheme evs for the slums or katchi abadies in the province of punjab. the evs aims to promote freedom of choice efficiency equity and social cohesion. a pilot project was started in  in the urban slums of sukhnehar lahore where a survey showed that all households were living below the poverty line. through the evs the foundation would deliver education vouchers to every household with children  years of age. the vouchers would be redeemable against tuition payments at participating private schools. in the pilot stage  households were given an opportunity to send their children to a private school of their choice. the evs makes its partner schools accountable to the parents rather than to the bureaucrats at the ministry of education. in the fas program every school principal has the choice of admitting a student or not. in the evs however the decision regarding where a child attends school is up to the parents because they are the ones carrying the education voucher issued by the pef. the partner schools are also accountable to the pef: they are subject to periodic reviews of their student learning outcomes additional private investments and improvements in working conditions of the teachers. the evs provides an incentive to parents to send their children to school and so it has become a source of competition among private schools seeking to join the program. when it comes to the selection of schools the following criteria are applied across the board: i the fee paid by the pef to evs partner schools is pkr  per child per month. schools charging higher fees can also apply to the program but they will not be paid more than pkr  and they will not be entitled to charge the difference from students families. ii total school enrollment should be between  and  children.  publicprivate partnerships in education iii the school should have an adequate infrastructure and a good learning environment. iv evs partner schools should be located within a half-kilometer radius of the residences of voucher holders. however if the parents prefer a particular school that is farther away the pef will have no objection provided that the school fulfills the evs selection criteria. v the pef advertises to stimulate the interest of potential partner schools. it then gives students at short-listed schools preliminary tests in selected subjects and conducts physical inspections of these schools. pef offices display a list of all the evs partner schools so that parents may consult it and choose a school for their children. by now more than   students are benefiting form evs and the program is being scaled up by financing from government of the punjab 
30	dr. allah bakhsh malik an academic and researcher from pakistan has discussed the crucial role of vouchers for the empowerment of disadvantaged groups in urban slums and remote rural areas. this has been documented in his book freedom of choice: affordable quality education in public private partnership available at google. it has also been documented in another publication by asian development bank titled public private partnership in education: lessons learned from punjab education foundatiion. it has been proved that education vouchers in a developing country like pakistan have ensured freedom of choice for the parents productive efficiency equity and social cohesion. there is absolutely no doubt about the design of the instrument of education vouchers but the maverick however lies in implementation.
