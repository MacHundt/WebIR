48	chess is a crappy tactical turn based rpg developed by a bunch of monkeys. right away you'll notice chess has no storyline. instead all you notice is the the white army and the black army are fighting each other over a battlefield. note the a battlefield because chess only has one story map. as for the actual combat it's extremely dull. each unit can kill another with only one hit. this means units with a real good movement ability dominate the field more on that bellow. there aren't even any combat animations or anything that happens in combat. one unit moves on it's space and captures it and they piece is removed from the game with no form of action or special effects. chess has shitty class balance. the queen is flat out overpowered while your actual front line units the pawns. can't do shit. i think the developers were afraid that no one would use the female character so they buffed up her abilities really high but now theres no point in using any other unit. the rest of the units suck. rooks can only move in  directions same with bishops. boring. also whats up with the knight? it has the most bizzare combat abilities of all the units? they're retardly hard to use cause they jump around like retards to move and attack. the devs should have named this unit ninja since knights didn't jump around like that in real life. worst part is the king. you see the devs decided that if your king gets captured you instantly lose the game. w-t-f? this wouldn't be a problem except that he can't move for crap. seriously the most important unit in the game can only move  space a turn? good luck keeping him alive while every other unit in the game dances around him. unbalanced classes lackluster gameplay and not to mention repetitive  hour games. chess is not worth the time or your money. buy final fantasy tactics or whk squad command instead.
