39	process:electrochemistry from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to: navigation search english chemist john daniell left and physicist michael faraday right both credited as founders of electrochemistry today.electrochemistry is a branch of chemistry that studies chemical reactions which take place in a solution at the interface of an electron conductor a metal or a semiconductor and an ionic conductor the electrolyte and which involve electron transfer between the electrode and the electrolyte or species in solution. if a chemical reaction is driven by an external applied voltage as in electrolysis or if a voltage is created by a chemical reaction as in a battery it is an electrochemical reaction. in contrast chemical reactions where electrons are transferred between molecules are called redox reactions. in general electrochemistry deals with situations where oxidation and reduction reactions are separated in space or time connected by an external electric circuit. . 16th

developments german physicist otto von guericke beside his electrical generator while conducting an experiment.understanding of electrical matters began in the sixteenth century. during this century the english scientist william gilbert spent  years experimenting with magnetism and to a lesser extent electricity. for his work on magnets gilbert became known as the father of magnetism. he discovered various methods for producing and strengthening magnets. in  the german physicist otto von guericke created the first electric generator which produced static electricity by applying friction in the machine. the generator was made of a large sulfur ball cast inside a glass globe mounted on a shaft. the ball was rotated by means of a crank and a static electric spark was produced when a pad was rubbed against the ball as it rotated. the globe could be removed and used as source for experiments with electricity. by the midth century the french chemist charles franois de cisternay du fay had discovered two types of static electricity and that like charges repel each other whilst unlike charges attract. du fay announced that electricity consisted of two fluids: vitreous from the latin for glass or positive electricity and resinous or negative electricity. this was the two-fluid theory of electricity which was to be opposed by benjamin franklin's one-fluid theory later in the century. late 1780s diagram of galvani's experiment on frog legs.charles-augustin de coulomb developed the law of electrostatic attraction in  as an outgrowth of his attempt to investigate the law of electrical repulsions as stated by joseph priestley in england. italian physicist alessandro volta showing his battery to french emperor napoleon bonaparte in the early 19th century.in the late 18th century the italian physician and anatomist luigi galvani marked the birth of electrochemistry by establishing a bridge between chemical reactions and electricity on his essay de viribus electricitatis in motu musculari commentarius latin for commentary on the effect of electricity on muscular motion in  where he proposed a nerveo-electrical substance on biological life forms. in his essay galvani concluded that animal tissue contained a here-to-fore neglected innate vital force which he termed animal electricity which activated nerves and muscles spanned by metal probes. he believed that this new force was a form of electricity in addition to the natural form produced by lightning or by the electric eel and torpedo ray as well as the artificial form produced by friction i.e. static electricity. galvani's scientific colleagues generally accepted his views but alessandro volta rejected the idea of an animal electric fluid replying that the frog's legs responded to differences in metal temper composition and bulk. galvani refuted this by obtaining muscular action with two pieces of the same material. sir humphry davy's portrait in the 19th century.in  william nicholson and johann wilhelm ritter succeeded in decomposing water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis. soon thereafter ritter discovered the process of electroplating. he also observed that the amount of metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an electrolytic process depended on the distance between the electrodes. by  ritter observed thermoelectric currents and anticipated the discovery of thermoelectricity by thomas johann seebeck. by the 1810s william hyde wollaston made improvements to the galvanic cell. sir humphry davy's work with electrolysis led to the conclusion that the production of electricity in simple electrolytic cells resulted from chemical action and that chemical combination occurred between substances of opposite charge. this work led directly to the isolation of sodium and potassium from their compounds and of the alkaline earth metals from theirs in . hans christian rsteds discovery of the magnetic effect of electrical currents in  was immediately recognized as an epoch-making advance although he left further work on electromagnetism to others. andr-marie ampre quickly repeated oestred's experiment and formulated them mathematically. in  estonian-german physicist thomas johann seebeck demonstrated the electrical potential in the juncture points of two dissimilar metals when there is a heat difference between the joints. in  the german scientist georg ohm expressed his law in this famous book die galvanische kette mathematisch bearbeitet the galvanic circuit investigated mathematically in which he gave his complete theory of electricity in  michael faraday's experiments led him to state his two laws of electrochemistry. in  john daniell invented a primary cell in which hydrogen was eliminated in the generation of the electricity. daniell had solved the problem of polarization. later results revealed that alloying the amalgamated zinc with mercury would produce a better voltage. swedish chemist svante arrhenius portrait circa 1880s.william grove produced the first fuel cell in . in  wilhelm weber developed the electrodynamometer. in  georges leclanch patented a new cell which eventually became the forerunner to the world's first widely used battery the zinc carbon cell. svante arrhenius published his thesis in  on recherches sur la conductibilit galvanique des lectrolytes investigations on the galvanic conductivity of electrolytes. from his results the author concluded that electrolytes when dissolved in water become to varying degrees split or dissociated into electrically opposite positive and negative ions. in  paul hroult and charles m. hall developed an efficient method the hallhroult process to obtain aluminium using electrolysis of molten alumina. in  friedrich ostwald concluded important studies of the conductivity and electrolytic dissociation of organic acids. german scientist walther nernst portrait in the 1910s.walther hermann nernst developed the theory of the electromotive force of the voltaic cell in . in  he showed how the characteristics of the current produced could be used to calculate the free energy change in the chemical reaction producing the current. he constructed an equation known as nernst equation which related the voltage of a cell to its properties. in  fritz haber showed that definite reduction products can result from electrolytic processes if the potential at the cathode is kept constant. in  he explained the reduction of nitrobenzene in stages at the cathode and this became the model for other similar reduction processes. edit the 20th century and recent developments in  the electrochemical society ecs was founded. in  robert andrews millikan began a series of experiments to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron. in  johannes nicolaus brnsted and martin lowry published essentially the same theory about how acids and bases behave using an electrochemical basis. arne tiselius developed the first sophisticated electrophoretic apparatus in  and some years later he was awarded the  nobel prize for his work in protein electrophoresis. a year later in  the international society of electrochemistry ise was founded. by the 1960s–1970s quantum electrochemistry was developed by revaz dogonadze and his pupils. main article: redox reaction redox stands for reduction-oxidation and are electrochemical processes involving electron transfer to or from a molecule or ion changing its oxidation state. this reaction can occur through the application of an external voltage or through the release of chemical energy. edit oxidation and reduction oxidation and reduction describe the change of oxidation state that takes place in the atoms ions or molecules involved in an electrochemical reaction. formally oxidation state is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were  ionic. an atom or ion that gives up an electron to another atom or ion has its oxidation state increase and the recipient of the negatively charged electron has its oxidation state decrease. oxidation and reduction always occur in a paired fashion such that one species is oxidized when another is reduced. this paired electron transfer is called a redox reaction. for example when atomic sodium reacts with atomic chlorine sodium donates one electron and attains an oxidation state of . chlorine accepts the electron and its oxidation state is reduced to . the sign of the oxidation state actually corresponds to the value of each ion's electronic charge. the attraction of the differently charged sodium and chlorine ions is the reason they then form an ionic bond. the loss of electrons from an atom or molecule is called oxidation and the gain of electrons is reduction. this can be easily remembered through the use of mnemonic devices. two of the most popular are oil rig oxidation is loss reduction is gain and leo the lion says ger lose electrons: oxidization gain electrons: reduction. for cases where electrons are shared covalent bonds between atoms with large differences in electronegativity the electron is assigned to the atom with the largest electronegativity in determining the oxidation state. the atom or molecule which loses electrons is known as the reducing agent or reductant and the substance which accepts the electrons is called the oxidizing agent or oxidant. the oxidizing agent is always being reduced in a reaction the reducing agent is always being oxidized. oxygen is a common oxidizing agent but not the only one. despite the name an oxidation reaction does not necessarily need to involve oxygen. in fact a fire can be fed by an oxidant other than oxygen fluorine fires are often unquenchable as fluorine is an even stronger oxidant it has a higher electronegativity than oxygen. for reactions involving oxygen the gain of oxygen implies the oxidation of the atom or molecule to which the oxygen is added and the oxygen is reduced. in organic compounds such as butane or ethanol the loss of hydrogen implies oxidation of the molecule from which it is lost and the hydrogen is reduced. this follows because the hydrogen donates its electron in covalent bonds with non-metals but it takes the electron along when it is lost. conversely loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen implies reduction. edit balancing redox reactions main article: chemical equation electrochemical reactions in water are better understood by balancing redox reactions using the ion-electron method where h oh ion ho and electrons to compensate the oxidation changes are added to cell's half-reactions for oxidation and reduction. in acid medium h ions and water are added to half-reactions to balance the overall reaction. for example when manganese reacts with sodium bismuthate. unbalanced reaction: mnaq  nabios  biaq  mnoaq oxidation:  hol  mnaq  mnoaq   haq   e reduction:  e   haq  bios  biaq   hol finally the reaction is balanced by multiplying the number of electrons from the reduction half reaction to oxidation half reaction and vice versa and adding both half reactions thus solving the equation.  hol   mnaq   mnoaq   haq   e  e   haq   bios   biaq   hol  haq   mnaq   nabios   hol   mnoaq   biaq   naaq in basic medium oh ions and water are added to half reactions to balance the overall reaction. for example on reaction between potassium permanganate and sodium sulfite. reduction:  e   ho  mno  mno   oh oxidation:  oh  so  so  ho   e the same procedure as followed on acid medium by multiplying electrons to opposite half reactions solve the equation thus balancing the overall reaction.  e   ho   mno   mno   oh  oh   so   so   ho  e  kmno   naso  ho   mno   naso   koh the same procedure as used on acid medium is applied for example on balancing using electron ion method to complete combustion of propane. unbalanced reaction: ch  o  co  ho reduction:  h  o   e   ho

ho  ho  ch   co   e   h ch   o   co   ho main article: electrochemical cell an electrochemical cell is a device that produces an electric current from energy released by a spontaneous redox reaction. this kind of cell includes the galvanic cell or voltaic cell named after luigi galvani and alessandro volta both scientists who conducted several experiments on chemical reactions and electric current during the late 18th century. electrochemical cells have two conductive electrodes the anode and the cathode. the anode is defined as the electrode where oxidation occurs and the cathode is the electrode where the reduction takes place. electrodes can be made from any sufficiently conductive materials such as metals semiconductors graphite and even conductive polymers. in between these electrodes is the electrolyte which contains ions that can freely move. the galvanic cell uses two different metal electrodes each in an electrolyte where the positively charged ions are the oxidized form of the electrode metal. one electrode will undergo oxidation the anode and the other will undergo reduction the cathode. the metal of the anode will oxidize going from an oxidation state of  in the solid form to a positive oxidation state and become an ion. at the cathode the metal ion in solution will accept one or more electrons from the cathode and the ion's oxidation state is reduced to . this forms a solid metal that electrodeposits on the cathode. the two electrodes must be electrically connected to each other allowing for a flow of electrons that leave the metal of the anode and flow through this connection to the ions at the surface of the cathode. this flow of electrons is an electrical current that can be used to do work such as turn a motor or power a light. a galvanic cell whose electrodes are zinc and copper submerged in zinc sulfate and copper sulfate respectively is known as a daniell cell. half reactions for a daniell cell are these: zinc electrode anode: zns  znaq   e copper electrode cathode: cuaq   e  cus a modern cell stand for electrochemical research. the electrodes attach to high-quality metallic wires and the stand is attached to a not pictured. a shot glass-shaped container is aerated with a noble gas and sealed with the teflon block.in this example the anode is zinc metal which oxidizes loses electrons to form zinc ions in solution and copper ions accept electrons from the copper metal electrode and the ions deposit at the copper cathode as an electrodeposit. this cell forms a simple battery as it will spontaneously generate a flow of electrical current from the anode to the cathode through the external connection. this reaction can be driven in reverse by applying a voltage resulting in the deposition of zinc metal at the anode and formation of copper ions at the cathode. to provide a complete electric circuit there must also be an ionic conduction path between the anode and cathode electrolytes in addition to the electron conduction path. the simplest ionic conduction path is to provide a liquid junction. to avoid mixing between the two electrolytes the liquid junction can be provided through a porous plug that allows ion flow while reducing electrolyte mixing. to further minimize mixing of the electrolytes a salt bridge can be used which consists of an electrolyte saturated gel in an inverted u-tube. as the negatively charged electrons flow in one direction around this circuit the positively charged metal ions flow in the opposite direction in the electrolyte. a voltmeter is capable of measuring the change of electrical potential between the anode and the cathode. electrochemical cell voltage is also referred to as electromotive force or emf. a cell diagram can be used to trace the path of the electrons in the electrochemical cell. for example here is a cell diagram of a daniell cell: zns zn m cu m cus first the reduced form of the metal to be oxidized at the anode zn is written. this is separated from its oxidized form by a vertical line which represents the limit between the phases oxidation changes. the double vertical lines represent the saline bridge on the cell. finally the oxidized form of the metal to be reduced at the cathode is written separated from its reduced form by the vertical line. the electrolyte concentration is given as it is an important variable in determining the cell potential. edit standard electrode potential main article: standard electrode potential to allow prediction of the cell potential tabulations of standard electrode potential are available. such tabulations are referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode she. the standard hydrogen electrode undergoes the reaction which is shown as reduction but in fact the she can act as either the anode or the cathode depending on the relative potential of the other combination. the term standard in she requires a supply of hydrogen gas bubbled through the electrolyte at a pressure of  atm and an acidic electrolyte with h activity equal to  usually assumed to be h   the she electrode can be connected to any other electrode by a salt bridge to form a cell. if the second electrode is also at standard conditions then the measured cell potential is called the standard electrode potential for the electrode. the standard electrode potential for the she is zero by definition. the polarity of the standard electrode potential provides information about the relative reduction potential of the electrode compared to the she. if the electrode has a positive potential with respect to the she then that means it is a strongly reducing electrode which forces the she to be the anode an example is cu in aqueous cuso with a standard electrode potential of . v. conversely if the measured potential is negative the electrode is more oxidizing than the she such as zn in znso where the standard electrode potential is . v. standard electrode potentials are usually tabulated as reduction potentials. however the reactions are reversible and the role of a particular electrode in a cell depends on the relative potential of both electrodes. the oxidation potential for a particular electrode is just the negative of the reduction potential. a standard cell potential can be determined by looking up the standard electrode potentials for both electrodes sometimes called half cell potentials. the one that is smaller will be the anode and will undergo oxidation. the cell potential is then calculated as the sum of the reduction potential for the cathode and the oxidation potential for the anode. ecell  eredcathode  eredanode  eredcathode  eoxianode for example the standard electrode potential for a copper electrode is: pts h atm h m cu  m cus ecell  eredcathode  eredanode at standard temperature pressure and concentration conditions the cell's emf measured by a multimeter is . v. by definition the electrode potential for the she is zero. thus the cu is the cathode and the she is the anode giving ecell    . v changes in the stoichiometric coefficients of a balanced cell equation will not change ered value because the standard electrode potential is an intensive property. edit spontaneity of redox reaction main article: spontaneous process during operation of electrochemical cells chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy and is expressed mathematically as the product of the cell's emf and the electric charge transferred through the external circuit. electrical energy  ecellctrans where ecell is the cell potential measured in volts v and ctrans is the cell current integrated over time and measured in coulombs c ctrans can also be determined by multiplying the total number of electrons transferred measured in moles times faraday's constant f. the emf of the cell at zero current is the maximum possible emf. it is used to calculate the maximum possible electrical energy that could be obtained from a chemical reaction. this energy is referred to as electrical work and is expressed by the following equation: where work is defined as positive into the system. since the free energy is the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a system one can write: a positive cell potential gives a negative change in gibbs free energy. this is consistent with the cell production of an electric current from the cathode to the anode through the external circuit. if the current is driven in the opposite direction by imposing an external potential then work is done on the cell to drive electrolysis. a spontaneous electrochemical reaction change in gibbs free energy less than zero can be used to generate an electric current in electrochemical cells. this is the basis of all batteries and fuel cells. for example gaseous oxygen o and hydrogen h can be combined in a fuel cell to form water and energy typically a combination of heat and electrical energy. conversely non-spontaneous electrochemical reactions can be driven forward by the application of a current at sufficient voltage. the electrolysis of water into gaseous oxygen and hydrogen is a typical example. the relation between the equilibrium constant k and the gibbs free energy for an electrochemical cell is expressed as follows: rearranging to express the relation between standard potential and equilibrium constant yields the previous equation can use briggsian logarithm as shown below: edit cell emf dependency on changes in concentration main article: nernst equation the standard potential of an electrochemical cell requires standard conditions for all of the reactants. when reactant concentrations differ from standard conditions the cell potential will deviate from the standard potential. in the 20th century german chemist walther nernst proposed a mathematical model to determine the effect of reactant concentration on electrochemical cell potential. in the late 19th century josiah willard gibbs had formulated a theory to predict whether a chemical reaction is spontaneous based on the free energy g  g  rtlnq here g is change in gibbs free energy t is absolute temperature r is the gas constant and q is reaction quotient. gibbs key contribution was to formalize the understanding of the effect of reactant concentration on spontaneity. based on gibbs work nernst extended the theory to include the contribution from electric potential on charged species. as shown in the previous section the change in gibbs free energy for an electrochemical cell can be related to the cell potential. thus gibbs theory becomes nfe  nfe  rt lnq here n is the number of product f is the faraday constant and e is cell potential. finally nernst divided through by the amount of charge transferred to arrive at a new equation which now bears his name: e  e  assuming standard conditions t   c and r  . the equation above can be expressed on base logarithm as shown below: main article: concentration cell a concentration cell is an electrochemical cell where the two electrodes are the same material the electrolytes on the two half-cells involve the same ions but the electrolyte concentration differs between the two half-cells. for example an electrochemical cell where two copper electrodes are submerged in two copperii sulfate solutions whose concentrations are . m and . m connected through a salt bridge. this type of cell will generate a potential that can be predicted by the nernst equation. both electrodes undergo the same chemistry although the reaction proceeds in reverse at the cathode cuaq   e  cus le chatelier's principle indicates that the reaction is more favorable to reduction as the concentration of cu ions increases. reduction will take place in the cell's compartment where concentration is higher and oxidation will occur on the more dilute side. the following cell diagram describes the cell mentioned above: cus cu . m cu . m cus where the half cell reactions for oxidation and reduction are: oxidation: cus  cu . m   e reduction: cu . m   e  cus overall reaction: cu . m  cu . m the cell's emf is calculated through nernst equation as follows: the value of e in this kind of cell is zero as electrodes and ions are the same in both half-cells. after replacing values from the case mentioned it is possible to calculate cell's potential: however this value is only approximate as reaction quotient is defined in terms of ion activities which can be approximated with the concentrations as calculated here. the nernst equation plays an important role in understanding electrical effects in cells and organelles. such effects include nerve synapses and cardiac beat as well as the resting potential of a somatic cell. main article: battery electricity a battery is a number of cells combined and is used to supply electrical energy that is stored chemically. the term battery is often and incorrectly used to describe a single cell. in a battery cells are usually wired in series to increase the supply voltage but sometimes wired in parallel to allow greater current to be supplied. batteries are optimized to produce a constant electric current for as long as possible. although the cells discussed previously are useful for theoretical purposes and some laboratory experiments the large internal resistance of the salt bridge make them inappropriate battery technologies. various alternative battery technologies have been commercialized as discussed next. main article: dry cell zinc carbon battery diagram.dry cells do not have a fluid electrolyte. instead they use a moist electrolyte paste. leclanchs cell is a good example of this where the anode is a zinc container surrounded by a thin layer of manganese dioxide and a moist electrolyte paste of ammonium chloride and zinc chloride mixed with starch. the cell's cathode is represented by a carbon bar inserted on the cell's electrolyte usually placed in the middle. leclanchs simplified half reactions are shown below: anode: zns  znaq   e cathode:  nhaq   mnos   e  mnos   nhaq  hol the voltage obtained from the zinc-carbon battery is around . v. main article: mercury battery cutaway view of a mercury battery.this battery first appeared in the early 1940s. the mercury battery has many applications in medicine and electronics. the battery consists of a steelmade container in the shape of a cylinder acting as the cathode where an amalgamated anode of mercury and zinc is surrounded by a stronger alkaline electrolyte and a paste of zinc oxide and mercuryii oxide. mercury battery half reactions are shown below: anode: znhg   ohaq  znos  hol   e cathode: hgos  hol   e  hgl   ohaq overall reaction: znhg  hgos  znos  hgl there are no changes in the electrolyte's composition when the cell works. such batteries provide . v of direct current. a sealed leadacid battery.main article: leadacid battery the leadacid battery used in automobiles consists of a series of six identical cells assembled in series. each cell has a lead anode and a cathode made from lead dioxide packed in a metal plaque. cathode and anode are submerged in a solution of sulfuric acid acting as the electrolyte. leadacid battery half cell reactions are shown below: anode: pbs  soaq  pbsos   e overall reaction: pbs  pbos   haq   soaq   pbsos   hol at standard conditions each cell may produce a potential of  v hence overall voltage produced is  v. differing from mercury and zinc-carbon batteries lead-acid batteries are rechargeable. if an external voltage is supplied to the battery it will produce an electrolysis of the products in the overall reaction discharge thus recovering initial components which made the battery work. edit lithium rechargeable battery main article: lithium battery instead of an aqueous electrolyte or a moist electrolyte paste a solid state battery operates using a solid electrolyte. lithium polymer batteries are an example of this a graphite bar acts as the anode a bar of lithium cobaltate acts as the cathode and a polymer swollen with a lithium salt allows the passage of ions and serves as the electrolyte. in this cell the carbon in the anode can reversibly form a lithium-carbon alloy. upon discharging lithium ions spontaneously leave the lithium cobaltate cathode and travel through the polymer and into the carbon anode forming the alloy. this flow of positive lithium ions is the electrical current that the battery provides. by charging the cell the lithium dealloys and travels back into the cathode. the advantage of this kind of battery is that lithium possess the highest negative value of standard reduction potential. it is also a light metal and therefore less mass is required to generate  mole of electrons. lithium ion battery technologies are widely used in portable electronic devices because they have high energy storage density and are rechargeable. these technologies show promise for future automotive applications with new materials such as iron phosphates and lithium vanadates. main article: flow battery most batteries have all of the electrolyte and electrodes within a single housing. a flow battery is unusual in that the majority of the electrolyte including dissolved reactive species is stored in separate tanks. the electrolytes are pumped through a reactor which houses the electrodes when the battery is charged or discharged. because the electrodes are preserved and the electrolyte combusted a flow battery is better described as a reversible fuel cell. these types of batteries are typically used for large-scale energy storage kwh  multi mwh. of the several different types that have been developed some are of current commercial interest including the flow battery vanadium redox battery and zinc-bromine flow battery. main article: fuel cell fossil fuels are used in power plants to supply electrical needs however their conversion into electricity is an inefficient process. the most efficient electrical power plant may only convert about  of the original chemical energy into electricity when burned or processed. to enhance electrical production scientists have developed fuel cells where combustion is replaced by electrochemical methods similar to a battery but requiring continuous replenishment of the reactants consumed. the most popular is the oxygen-hydrogen fuel cell where two inert electrodes porous electrodes of nickel and nickel oxide are placed in an electrolytic solution such as hot caustic potash in both compartments anode and cathode gaseous hydrogen and oxygen are bubbled into solution. oxygen-hydrogen fuel cell reactions are shown bellow: anode:  hg   h   e cathode: og   e   h   hol overall reaction:  hg  og   hol the overall reaction is identical to hydrogen combustion. oxidation and reduction take place in the anode and cathode separately. this is similar to the electrode used in the cell for measuring standard reduction potential which has a double function acting as electrical conductors providing a surface required to decomposition of the molecules into atoms before electron transferring thus named electrocatalysts. platinum nickel and rhodium are good electrocatalysts. corrosion is the term applied to steel rust caused by an electrochemical process. most people are likely familiar with the corrosion of iron in the form of reddish rust. other examples include the black tarnish on silver and red or green corrosion that may appear on copper and its alloys such as brass. the cost of replacing metals lost to corrosion is in the multi-billions of dollars per year. for iron rust to occur the metal has to be in contact with oxygen and water although chemical reactions for this process are relatively complex and not all of them are completely understood it is believed the causes are the following: electron transferring reduction-oxidation one area on the surface of the metal acts as the anode which is where the oxidation corrosion occurs. at the anode the metal gives up electrons. fes  feaq   e electrons are transferred from iron reducing oxygen in the atmosphere into water on the cathode which is placed in another region of the metal. og   haq   e   hol global reaction for the standard h  feoxho. salt edit use. eggs edit prevention of corrosion non conducting main

water reaction is favored for oxidation producing gaseous oxygen however experiments show gaseous chlorine is produced and not oxygen. although the initial analysis is correct there is another effect that can happen known as the overvoltage effect. additional voltage is sometimes required beyond the voltage predicted by the ecell. this may be due to kinetic rather than thermodynamic considerations. in fact it has been proven that the activation energy for the chloride ion is very low hence favorable in kinetic terms. in other words although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis the rate is so slow that to make the process proceed in a reasonable time frame the voltage of the external source has to be increased hence overvoltage. finally reaction  is favorable because it describes the proliferation of oh ions thus letting a probable reduction of h ions less favorable an option. the overall reaction for the process according to the analysis would be the following: anode oxidation:  claq  clg   e cathode reduction:  hol   e  hg   ohaq overall reaction:  ho   claq  hg  clg   ohaq as the overall reaction indicates the concentration of chloride ions is reduced in comparison to oh ions whose concentration increases. the reaction also shows the production of gaseous hydrogen chlorine and aqueous sodium hydroxide. edit quantitative electrolysis and faraday's laws main article: faraday's law of electrolysis quantitative aspects of electrolysis were originally developed by michael faraday in . faraday is also credited to have coined the terms electrolyte electrolysis among many others while he studied quantitative analysis of electrochemical reactions. also he was an advocate of the law of conservation of energy. faraday concluded after several experiments on electrical current in non spontaneous process the mass of the products yielded on the electrodes was proportional to the value of current supplied to the cell the length of time the current existed and the molar mass of the substance analyzed. in other words the amount of a substance deposited on each electrode of an electrolytic cell is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the cell. below is a simplified equation of faraday's first law: m is the mass of the substance produced at the electrode in grams q is the total electric charge that passed through the solution in coulombs n is the valence number of the substance as an ion in solution electrons per ion m is the molar mass of the substance in grams per mole. faraday devised the laws of chemical electrodeposition of metals from solutions in . he formulated the second law of electrolysis stating the amounts of bodies which are equivalent to each other in their ordinary chemical action have equal quantities of electricity naturally associated with them. in other terms the quantities of different elements deposited by a given amount of electricity are in the ratio of their chemical equivalent weights. an important aspect of the second law of electrolysis is electroplating which together with the first law of electrolysis has a significant number of applications in the industry as when used to protect metals to avoid corrosion. there are various extremely important electrochemical processes in both nature and industry like the coating of objects with metals or metal oxides through electrodeposition and the detection of alcohol in drunken drivers through the redox reaction of ethanol. the generation of chemical energy through photosynthesis is inherently an electrochemical process as is production of metals like aluminum and titanium from their ores. certain diabetes blood sugar meters measure the amount of glucose in the blood through its redox potential. the nervous impulses in neurons are based on electric current generated by the movement of sodium and potassium ions into and out of cells and certain animals like eels can generate a powerful voltage from certain cells that can disable much larger animals. contact tension  a historical forerunner to the theory of electrochemistry. important publications in

patina of green-blue copper carbonate forms on the surface of copper with exposure to the water and carbon dioxide in the air. silver coins or cutlery that are exposed to high sulfur foods such as egg or the low levels of sulfur species in the air develop a layer of black silver sulfide. gold and platinum are extremely difficult to oxidize under normal circumstances and require exposure to a powerful chemical oxidizing agent such as aqua regia. some common metals oxidize extremely rapidly in air. titanium and aluminium oxidize instantaneously in contact with the oxygen in the air. these metals form an extremely thin layer of oxidized metal on the surface. this thin layer of oxide protects the underlying layers of the metal from the air preventing the entire metal from oxidizing. these metals are used in applications where corrosion resistance is important. iron in contrast has an oxide that forms in air and water called rust that does not stop the further oxidation of the iron. thus iron left exposed to air and water will continue to rust until all of the iron is oxided. attempts to save a metal from becoming anodic are of two general types. anodic regions dissolve and destroy the structural integrity of the metal. while it is almost impossible to prevent formation if a insulator material covers the metal contact with the electrolyte is not possible and corrosion will not occur. metals can be coated with paint or other less conductive metals passivation. this prevents the metal surface from being exposed to electrolytes. scratches exposing the metal substrate will result in corrosion. the region under the coating adjacent to the scratch acts as the anode of the reaction. a method commonly used to protect a structural metal is to attach a metal which is more anodic than the metal to be protected. this forces the structural metal to be cathodic thus spared corrosion. it is called sacrificial because the anode dissolves and has to be replaced periodically. zinc bars are attached to various locations on steel ship hull to render the ship hull the zinc bars are replaced periodically. other metals such as magnesium would work very well but zinc is the least expensive useful metal. to protect pipelines an ingot of buried or exposed magnesium or zinc is beside the pipe and is electrically to the pipe above ground. the pipeline is forced to be a cathode and is protected from being oxidized and rusting. the magnesium anode is sacrificed. at intervals new ingots are buried to replace those lost. from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump

chemical reactions which take place in a solution at the interface of an electron conductor a metal or a semiconductor and an ionic conductor the electrolyte and which involve electron transfer between the electrode and the electrolyte or species in solution. if a chemical reaction is driven by an external applied voltage as in electrolysis or if a voltage is created by a chemical reaction as in a battery it is an electrochemical reaction. in contrast chemical reactions where electrons are transferred between molecules are called redox reactions. in general electrochemistry deals with

generator while conducting an experiment.understanding of electrical matters began in the sixteenth century. during this century the english scientist william gilbert spent  years experimenting with magnetism and to a lesser extent electricity. for his work on magnets gilbert became known as the father of magnetism. he discovered various methods for producing and strengthening magnets. in  the german physicist otto von guericke created the first electric generator which produced static electricity by applying friction in the machine. the generator was made of a large sulfur ball cast inside a glass globe mounted on a shaft. the ball was rotated by means of a crank and a static electric spark was produced when a pad was rubbed against the ball as it rotated. the globe could be removed and used as source for experiments with electricity. by the midth century the french chemist charles franois de cisternay du fay had discovered two types of static electricity and that like charges repel each other whilst unlike charges attract. du fay announced that electricity consisted of two fluids: vitreous from the latin for glass or positive electricity and resinous or negative electricity. this was the two-fluid theory of electricity which was to be opposed by benjamin franklin's one-fluid theory later in the century. late 1780s diagram of galvani's experiment on frog legs.charles-augustin de coulomb developed the law of electrostatic attraction in  as an outgrowth of his attempt to investigate the law of electrical repulsions as stated by joseph priestley in england. italian physicist alessandro volta showing his battery to french emperor napoleon bonaparte in the early 19th century.in the late 18th century the italian physician and anatomist luigi galvani marked the birth of electrochemistry by establishing a bridge between chemical reactions and electricity on his essay de viribus electricitatis in motu musculari commentarius latin for commentary on the effect of electricity on muscular motion in  where he proposed a nerveo-electrical substance on biological life forms. in his essay galvani concluded that animal tissue contained a here-to-fore neglected innate vital force which he termed animal electricity which activated nerves and muscles spanned by metal probes. he believed that this new force was a form of electricity in addition to the natural form produced by lightning or by the electric eel and torpedo ray as well as the artificial form produced by friction i.e. static electricity. galvani's scientific colleagues generally accepted his views but alessandro volta rejected the idea of an animal electric fluid replying that the frog's legs responded to differences in metal temper composition and bulk. galvani refuted this by obtaining muscular action with two pieces of the same material. sir humphry davy's portrait in the 19th century.in  william nicholson and johann wilhelm ritter succeeded in decomposing water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis. soon thereafter ritter discovered the process of electroplating. he also observed that the amount of metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an electrolytic process depended on the distance between the electrodes. by  ritter observed thermoelectric currents and anticipated the discovery of thermoelectricity by thomas johann seebeck. by the 1810s william hyde wollaston made improvements to the galvanic cell. sir humphry davy's work with electrolysis led to the conclusion that the production of electricity in simple electrolytic cells resulted from chemical action and that chemical combination occurred between substances of opposite charge. this work led directly to the isolation of sodium and potassium from their compounds and of the alkaline earth metals from theirs in . hans christian rsteds discovery of the magnetic effect of electrical currents in  was immediately recognized as an epoch-making advance although he left further work on electromagnetism to others. andr-marie ampre quickly repeated oestred's experiment and formulated them mathematically. in  estonian-german physicist thomas johann seebeck demonstrated the electrical potential in the juncture points of two dissimilar metals when there is a heat difference between the joints. in  the german scientist georg ohm expressed his law in this famous book die galvanische kette mathematisch bearbeitet the galvanic circuit investigated mathematically in which he gave his complete theory of electricity. in  michael faraday's experiments led him to state his two laws of electrochemistry. in  john daniell invented a primary cell in which hydrogen was eliminated in the generation of the electricity. daniell had solved the problem of polarization. later results revealed that alloying the amalgamated zinc with mercury would produce a better voltage. swedish chemist svante arrhenius portrait circa 1880s.william grove produced the

zinc carbon cell. svante arrhenius published his thesis in  on recherches sur la conductibilit galvanique des lectrolytes investigations on the galvanic conductivity of electrolytes. from his results the author concluded that electrolytes when dissolved in water become to varying degrees split or dissociated into electrically opposite positive and negative ions. in  paul hroult and charles m. hall developed an efficient method the hallhroult process to obtain aluminium using electrolysis of molten alumina. in  friedrich ostwald concluded important studies of the conductivity and electrolytic dissociation of organic acids. german scientist walther nernst portrait in the 1910s.walther hermann nernst developed the theory of the electromotive force of the voltaic cell in . in  he showed how the characteristics of the current produced could be used to calculate the free energy change in the chemical reaction producing the current. he constructed an equation known as nernst equation which related the voltage of a cell to its properties. in  fritz haber showed that definite reduction products can result from electrolytic processes if the potential at the cathode is kept constant. in  he explained the reduction of nitrobenzene in stages at the cathode and this became the model for other similar reduction processes. edit the 20th century and recent developments in  the electrochemical society ecs was founded. in  robert andrews millikan began a series of experiments to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron. in  johannes nicolaus brnsted and martin lowry published essentially the same theory about how acids and bases behave using an electrochemical basis. arne tiselius developed the first sophisticated electrophoretic apparatus in  and some years later he was awarded the  nobel prize for his work in protein electrophoresis. a year later in  the international society of electrochemistry ise was founded. by the 1960s–1970s quantum electrochemistry was developed by revaz dogonadze and his pupils. main article: redox reaction redox stands for reduction-oxidation and are electrochemical processes involving electron transfer to or from a molecule or ion changing its oxidation state. this reaction can occur through the application of an external voltage or through the release of chemical energy. edit oxidation and reduction oxidation and reduction describe the change of oxidation state that takes place in the atoms ions or molecules involved in an electrochemical reaction. formally oxidation state is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were  ionic. an atom or ion that gives up an electron to another atom or ion has its oxidation state increase and the recipient of the negatively charged electron has its oxidation state decrease. oxidation and reduction always occur in a paired fashion such that one species is oxidized when another is reduced. this paired electron transfer is called a redox reaction. for example when atomic sodium reacts with atomic chlorine sodium donates one electron and attains an oxidation state of . chlorine accepts the electron and its oxidation state is reduced to . the sign of the oxidation state actually corresponds to the value of each ion's electronic charge. the attraction of the differently charged sodium and chlorine ions is the reason they then form an ionic bond. the loss of electrons from an atom or molecule is called oxidation and the gain of electrons is reduction. this can be easily remembered through the use of mnemonic devices. two of the most popular are oil rig oxidation is loss reduction is gain and leo the lion says ger lose electrons: oxidization gain electrons: reduction. for cases where electrons are shared covalent bonds between atoms with large differences in electronegativity the electron is assigned to the atom with the largest electronegativity in determining the oxidation state. the atom or molecule which loses electrons is known as the reducing agent or reductant and the substance which accepts the electrons is called the oxidizing agent or oxidant. the oxidizing agent is always being reduced in a reaction the reducing agent is always being oxidized. oxygen is a common oxidizing agent but not the only one. despite the name an oxidation reaction does not necessarily need to involve oxygen. in fact a fire can be fed by an oxidant other than oxygen fluorine fires are often unquenchable as fluorine is an even stronger oxidant it has a higher electronegativity than oxygen. for reactions involving oxygen the gain of oxygen implies the oxidation of the atom or molecule to which the oxygen is added and the oxygen is reduced. in organic compounds such as butane or ethanol the loss of hydrogen implies oxidation of the molecule from which it is lost and the hydrogen is reduced. this follows because the hydrogen donates its electron in covalent bonds with non-metals but it takes the electron along when it is lost. conversely loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen implies reduction. edit balancing redox reactions main article: chemical equation electrochemical reactions in water are better understood by balancing redox reactions using the ion-electron method where h oh ion ho and electrons to compensate the oxidation changes are added to cell's half-reactions for oxidation and reduction. in acid medium h ions and water are added to half-reactions to balance the overall reaction. for example when manganese reacts with sodium bismuthate. unbalanced reaction: mnaq  nabios  biaq  mnoaq oxidation:  hol  mnaq  mnoaq   haq   e reduction:  e   haq  bios  biaq   hol finally the reaction is balanced by multiplying the number of electrons from the reduction half reaction to oxidation half reaction and vice versa and adding both half reactions thus solving the equation.  hol   mnaq   mnoaq   haq   e  e   haq   bios   biaq   hol  haq   mnaq   nabios   hol   mnoaq   biaq   naaq in basic medium oh ions and water are added to half reactions to balance the overall reaction. for example on reaction between potassium permanganate and sodium sulfite. reduction:  e   ho  mno  mno   oh oxidation:  oh  so  so  ho   e the same procedure as followed on acid medium by multiplying electrons to opposite half reactions solve the equation thus balancing the overall reaction.  e   ho   mno   mno   oh  oh   so   so   ho  e  kmno   naso  ho   mno   naso   koh the same procedure as used on acid medium is applied for example on balancing using electron ion method to complete combustion of propane. unbalanced reaction: ch  o  co  ho reduction:  h  o   e   ho oxidation:  ho  ch   co   e   h as in acid and basic medium electrons which were used to compensate oxidation changes are multiplied to opposite half reactions thus solving the equation.  h   o   e   ho  ho  ch   co   e   h ch   o   co   ho main article: electrochemical cell an electrochemical cell is a device that produces an electric current from energy released by a spontaneous redox reaction. this kind of cell includes the galvanic cell or voltaic cell named after luigi galvani and alessandro volta both scientists who conducted several experiments on chemical reactions and electric current during the late 18th century. electrochemical cells have two conductive electrodes the anode and the cathode. the anode is defined as the electrode where oxidation occurs and the cathode is the electrode where the reduction takes place. electrodes can be made from any sufficiently conductive materials such as metals semiconductors graphite and even conductive polymers. in between these electrodes is the electrolyte which contains ions that can freely move. the galvanic cell uses two different metal electrodes each in an electrolyte where the positively charged ions are the oxidized form of the electrode metal. one electrode will undergo oxidation the anode and the other will undergo reduction the cathode. the metal of the anode will oxidize going from an oxidation state of  in the solid form to a positive oxidation state and become an ion. at the cathode the metal ion in solution will accept one or more electrons from the cathode and the ion's oxidation state is reduced to . this forms a solid metal that electrodeposits on the cathode. the two electrodes must be electrically connected to each other allowing for a flow of electrons that leave the metal of the anode and flow through this connection to the ions at the surface of the cathode. this flow of electrons is an electrical current that can be used to do work such as turn a motor or power a light. a galvanic cell whose electrodes are zinc and copper submerged in zinc sulfate and copper sulfate respectively is known as a daniell cell. half reactions for a daniell cell are these: zinc electrode anode: zns  znaq   e copper electrode cathode: cuaq   e  cus a modern cell stand for electrochemical research. the electrodes attach to high-quality metallic wires and the stand is attached to a not pictured. a shot glass-shaped container is aerated with a noble gas and sealed with the teflon block.in this example the anode is zinc metal which oxidizes loses electrons to form zinc ions in solution and copper ions accept electrons from the copper metal electrode and the ions deposit at the copper cathode as an electrodeposit. this cell forms a simple battery as it will spontaneously generate a flow of electrical current from the anode to the cathode through the external connection. this reaction can be driven in reverse by applying a voltage resulting in the deposition of zinc metal at the anode and formation of copper ions at the cathode. to provide a complete electric circuit there must also be an ionic conduction path between the anode and cathode electrolytes in addition to the electron conduction path. the simplest ionic conduction path is to provide a liquid junction. to avoid mixing between the two electrolytes the liquid junction can be provided through a porous plug that allows ion flow while reducing electrolyte mixing. to further minimize mixing of the electrolytes a salt bridge can be used which consists of an electrolyte saturated gel in an inverted u-tube. as the negatively charged electrons flow in one direction around this circuit the positively charged metal ions flow in the opposite direction in the electrolyte. a voltmeter is capable of measuring the change of electrical potential between the anode and the cathode. electrochemical cell voltage is also referred to as electromotive force or emf. a cell diagram can be used to trace the path of the electrons in the electrochemical cell. for example here is a cell diagram of a daniell cell: zns zn m cu m cus first the reduced form of the metal to be oxidized at the anode zn is written. this is separated from its oxidized form by a vertical line which represents the limit between the phases oxidation changes. the double vertical lines represent the saline bridge on the cell. finally the oxidized form of the metal to be reduced at the cathode is written separated from its reduced form by the vertical line. the electrolyte concentration is given as it is an important variable in determining the cell potential. edit standard electrode potential main article: standard electrode potential to allow prediction of the cell potential tabulations of standard electrode potential are available. such tabulations are referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode she. the standard hydrogen electrode undergoes the reaction which is shown as reduction but in fact the she can act as either the anode or the cathode depending on the relative potential of the other combination. the term standard in she requires a supply of hydrogen gas bubbled through the electrolyte at a pressure of  atm and an acidic electrolyte with h activity equal to  usually assumed to be h   the she electrode can be connected to any other electrode by a salt bridge to form a cell. if the second electrode is also at standard conditions then the measured cell potential is called the standard electrode potential for the electrode. the standard electrode potential for the she is zero by definition. the polarity of the standard electrode potential provides information about the relative reduction potential of the electrode compared to the she. if the electrode has a positive potential with respect to the she then that means it is a strongly reducing electrode which forces the she to be the anode an example is cu in aqueous cuso with a standard electrode potential of . v. conversely if the measured potential is negative the electrode is more oxidizing than the she such as zn in znso where the standard electrode potential is . v. standard electrode potentials are usually tabulated as reduction potentials. however the reactions are reversible and the role of a particular electrode in a cell depends on the relative potential of both electrodes. the oxidation potential for a particular electrode is just the negative of the reduction potential. a standard cell potential can be determined by looking up the standard electrode potentials for both electrodes sometimes called half cell potentials. the one that is smaller will be the anode and will undergo oxidation. the cell potential is then calculated as the sum of the reduction potential for the cathode and the oxidation potential for the anode. ecell  eredcathode  eredanode  eredcathode  eoxianode for example the standard electrode potential for a copper electrode is: pts h atm h m cu  m cus ecell  eredcathode  eredanode at standard temperature pressure and concentration conditions the cell's emf measured by a multimeter is . v. by definition the electrode potential for the she is zero. thus the cu is the cathode and the she is the anode giving ecell    . v changes in the stoichiometric coefficients of a balanced cell equation will not change ered value because the standard electrode potential is an intensive property. edit spontaneity of redox reaction main article: spontaneous process during operation of electrochemical cells chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy and is expressed mathematically as the product of the cell's emf and the electric charge transferred through the external circuit. electrical energy  ecellctrans where ecell is the cell potential measured in volts v and ctrans is the cell current integrated over time and measured in coulombs c ctrans can also be determined by multiplying the total number of electrons transferred measured in moles times faraday's constant f. the emf of the cell at zero current is the maximum possible emf. it is used to calculate the maximum possible electrical energy that could be obtained from a chemical reaction. this energy is referred to as electrical work and is expressed by the following equation: where work is defined as positive into the system. since the free energy is the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a system one can write: a positive cell potential gives a negative change in gibbs free energy. this is consistent with the cell production of an electric current from the cathode to the anode through the external circuit. if the current is driven in the opposite direction by imposing an external potential then work is done on the cell to drive electrolysis. a spontaneous electrochemical reaction change in gibbs free energy less than zero can be used to generate an electric current in electrochemical cells. this is the basis of all batteries and fuel cells. for example gaseous oxygen o and hydrogen h can be combined in a fuel cell to form water and energy typically a combination of heat and electrical energy. conversely non-spontaneous electrochemical reactions can be driven forward by the application of a current at sufficient voltage. the electrolysis of water into gaseous oxygen and hydrogen is a typical example. the relation between the equilibrium constant k and the gibbs free energy for an electrochemical cell is expressed as follows: rearranging to express the relation between standard potential and equilibrium constant yields the previous equation can use briggsian logarithm as shown below: edit cell emf dependency on changes in concentration main article: nernst equation the standard potential of an electrochemical cell requires standard conditions for all of the reactants. when reactant concentrations differ from standard conditions the cell potential will deviate from the standard potential. in the 20th century german chemist walther nernst proposed a mathematical model to determine the effect of reactant concentration on electrochemical cell potential. in the late 19th century josiah willard gibbs had formulated a theory to predict whether a chemical reaction is spontaneous based on the free energy g  g  rtlnq here g is change in gibbs free energy t is absolute temperature r is the gas constant and q is reaction quotient. gibbs key contribution was to formalize the understanding of the effect of reactant concentration on spontaneity. based on gibbs work nernst extended the theory to include the contribution from electric potential on charged species. as shown in the previous section the change in gibbs free energy for an electrochemical cell can be related to the cell potential. thus gibbs theory becomes nfe  nfe  rt lnq here n is the number of product f is the faraday constant and e is cell potential. finally nernst divided through by the amount of charge transferred to arrive at a new equation which now bears his name: e  e  assuming standard conditions t   c and r  . the equation above can be expressed on base logarithm as shown below: main article: concentration cell a concentration cell is an electrochemical cell where the two electrodes are the same material the electrolytes on the two half-cells involve the same ions but the electrolyte concentration differs between the two half-cells. for example an electrochemical cell where two copper electrodes are submerged in two copperii sulfate solutions whose concentrations are . m and . m connected through a salt bridge. this type of cell will generate a potential that can be predicted by the nernst equation. both electrodes undergo the same chemistry although the reaction proceeds in reverse at the cathode cuaq   e  cus le chatelier's principle indicates that the reaction is more favorable to reduction as the concentration of cu ions increases. reduction will take place in the cell's compartment where concentration is higher and oxidation will occur on the more dilute side. the following cell diagram describes the cell mentioned above: cus cu . m cu . m cus where the half cell reactions for oxidation and reduction are: oxidation: cus  cu . m   e reduction: cu . m   e  cus overall reaction: cu . m  cu . m the cell's emf is calculated through nernst equation as follows: the value of e in this kind of cell is zero as electrodes and ions are the same in both half-cells. after replacing values from the case mentioned it is possible to calculate cell's potential: however this value is only approximate as reaction quotient is defined in terms of ion activities which can be approximated with the concentrations as calculated here. the nernst equation plays an important role in understanding electrical effects in cells and organelles. such effects include nerve synapses and cardiac beat as well as the resting potential of a somatic cell. main article: battery electricity a battery is a number of cells combined and is used to supply electrical energy that is stored chemically. the term battery is often and incorrectly used to describe a single cell. in a battery cells are usually wired in series to increase the supply voltage but sometimes wired in parallel to allow greater current to be supplied. batteries are optimized to produce a constant electric current for as long as possible. although the cells discussed previously are useful for theoretical purposes and some laboratory experiments the large internal resistance of the salt bridge make them inappropriate battery technologies. various alternative battery technologies have been commercialized as discussed next. main article: dry cell zinc carbon battery diagram.dry cells do not have a fluid electrolyte. instead they use a moist electrolyte paste. leclanchs cell is a good example of this where the anode is a zinc container surrounded by a thin layer of manganese dioxide and a moist electrolyte paste of ammonium chloride and zinc chloride mixed with starch. the cell's cathode is represented by a carbon bar inserted on the cell's electrolyte usually placed in the middle. leclanchs simplified half reactions are shown below: anode: zns  znaq   e cathode:  nhaq   mnos   e  mnos   nhaq  hol the voltage obtained from the zinc-carbon battery is around . v. main article: mercury battery cutaway view of a mercury battery.this battery first appeared in the early 1940s. the mercury battery has many applications in medicine and electronics. the battery consists of a steelmade container in the shape of a cylinder acting as the cathode where an amalgamated anode of mercury and zinc is surrounded by a stronger alkaline electrolyte and a paste of zinc oxide and mercuryii oxide. mercury battery half reactions are shown below: anode: znhg   ohaq  znos  hol   e cathode: hgos  hol   e  hgl   ohaq overall reaction: znhg  hgos  znos  hgl there are no changes in the electrolyte's composition when the cell works. such batteries provide . v of direct current. a sealed leadacid battery.main article: leadacid battery the leadacid battery used in automobiles consists of a series of six identical cells assembled in series. each cell has a lead anode and a cathode made from lead dioxide packed in a metal plaque. cathode and anode are submerged in a solution of sulfuric acid acting as the electrolyte. leadacid battery half cell reactions are shown below: anode: pbs  soaq  pbsos   e overall reaction: pbs  pbos   haq   soaq   pbsos   hol at standard conditions each cell may produce a potential of  v hence overall voltage produced is  v. differing from mercury and zinc-carbon batteries lead-acid batteries are rechargeable. if an external voltage is supplied to the battery it will produce an electrolysis of the products in the overall reaction discharge thus recovering initial components which made the battery work. edit lithium rechargeable battery main article: lithium battery instead of an aqueous electrolyte or a moist electrolyte paste a solid state battery operates using a solid electrolyte. lithium polymer batteries are an example of this a graphite bar acts as the anode a bar of lithium cobaltate acts as the cathode and a polymer swollen with a lithium salt allows the passage of ions and serves as the electrolyte. in this cell the carbon in the anode can reversibly form a lithium-carbon alloy. upon discharging lithium ions spontaneously leave the lithium cobaltate cathode and travel through the polymer and into the carbon anode forming the alloy. this flow of positive lithium ions is the electrical current that the battery provides. by charging the cell the lithium dealloys and travels back into the cathode. the advantage of this kind of battery is that lithium possess the highest negative value of standard reduction potential. it is also a light metal and therefore less mass is required to generate  mole of electrons. lithium ion battery technologies are widely used in portable electronic devices because they have high energy storage density and are rechargeable. these technologies show promise for future automotive applications with new materials such as iron phosphates and lithium vanadates. main article: flow battery most batteries have all of the electrolyte and electrodes within a single housing. a flow battery is unusual in that the majority of the electrolyte including dissolved reactive species is stored in separate tanks. the electrolytes are pumped through a reactor which houses the electrodes when the battery is charged or discharged. because the electrodes are preserved and the electrolyte combusted a flow battery is better described as a reversible fuel cell. these types of batteries are typically used for large-scale energy storage kwh  multi mwh. of the several different types that have been developed some are of current commercial interest including the flow battery vanadium redox battery and zinc-bromine flow battery. main article: fuel cell fossil fuels are used in power plants to supply electrical needs however their conversion into electricity is an inefficient process. the most efficient electrical power plant may only convert about  of the original chemical energy into electricity when burned or processed. to enhance electrical production scientists have developed fuel cells where combustion is replaced by electrochemical methods similar to a battery but requiring continuous replenishment of the reactants consumed. the most popular is the oxygen-hydrogen fuel cell where two inert electrodes porous electrodes of nickel and nickel oxide are placed in an electrolytic solution such as hot caustic potash in both compartments anode and cathode gaseous hydrogen and oxygen are bubbled into solution. oxygen-hydrogen fuel cell reactions are shown bellow: anode:  hg   h   e cathode: og   e   h   hol overall reaction:  hg  og   hol the overall reaction is identical to hydrogen combustion. oxidation and reduction take place in the anode and cathode separately. this is similar to the electrode used in the cell for measuring standard reduction potential which has a double function acting as electrical conductors providing a surface required to decomposition of the molecules into atoms before electron transferring thus named electrocatalysts. platinum nickel and rhodium are good electrocatalysts. corrosion is the term applied to steel rust caused by an electrochemical process. most people are likely familiar with the corrosion of iron in the form of reddish rust. other examples include the black tarnish on silver and red or green corrosion that may appear on copper and its alloys such as brass. the cost of replacing metals lost to corrosion is in the multi-billions of dollars per year. for iron rust to occur the metal has to be in contact with oxygen and water although chemical reactions for this process are relatively complex and not all of them are completely understood it is believed the causes are the following: electron transferring reduction-oxidation one area on the surface of the metal acts as the anode which is where the oxidation corrosion occurs. at the anode the metal gives up electrons. fes  feaq   e electrons are transferred from iron reducing oxygen in the atmosphere into water on the cathode which is placed in another region of the metal. og   haq   e   hol global reaction for the process:  fes  og   haq   feaq   hol standard emf for iron rusting: e  ecathode  eanode e  .v  . v  . v iron corrosion takes place on acid medium h ions come from reaction between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and water forming carbonic acid. fe ions oxides following this equation:  feaq  og  xhol   feoxho   haq ironiii oxide hydrated is known as rust. the concentration of water associated with iron oxide varies thus chemical representation is presented as feoxho. the electric circuit works as passage of electrons and ions occurs thus if an electrolyte is present it will facilitate oxidation this explains why rusting is quicker on salt water. edit corrosion of common metals coinage metals such as copper and silver slowly corrode through use. a patina of green-blue copper carbonate forms on the surface of copper with exposure to the water and carbon dioxide in the air. silver coins or cutlery that are exposed to high sulfur foods such as eggs or the low levels of sulfur species in the air develop a layer of black silver sulfide. gold and platinum are extremely difficult to oxidize under normal circumstances and require exposure to a powerful chemical oxidizing agent such as aqua regia. some common metals oxidize extremely rapidly in air. titanium and aluminium oxidize instantaneously in contact with the oxygen in the air. these metals form an extremely thin layer of oxidized metal on the surface. this thin layer of oxide protects the underlying layers of the metal from the air preventing the entire metal from oxidizing. these metals are used in applications where corrosion resistance is important. iron in contrast has an oxide that forms in air and water called rust that does not stop the further oxidation of the iron. thus iron left exposed to air and water will continue to rust until all of the iron is oxided. edit prevention of corrosion attempts to save a metal from becoming anodic are of two general types. anodic regions dissolve and destroy the structural integrity of the metal. while it is almost impossible to prevent formation if a non conducting material covers the metal contact with the electrolyte is not possible and corrosion will not occur. metals can be coated with paint or other less conductive metals passivation. this prevents the metal surface from being exposed to electrolytes. scratches exposing the metal substrate will result in corrosion. the region under the coating adjacent to the scratch acts as the anode of the reaction. main article: sacrificial anode a method commonly used to protect a structural metal is to attach a metal which is more anodic than the metal to be protected. this forces the structural metal to be cathodic thus spared corrosion. it is called sacrificial because the anode dissolves and has to be replaced periodically. zinc bars are attached to various locations on steel ship hulls to render the ship hull cathodic. the zinc bars are replaced periodically. other metals such as magnesium would work very well but zinc is the least expensive useful metal. to protect pipelines an ingot of buried or exposed magnesium or zinc is buried beside the pipeline and is connected electrically to the pipe above ground. the pipeline is forced to be a cathode and is protected from being oxidized and rusting. the magnesium anode is sacrificed. at intervals new ingots are buried to replace those lost. the spontaneous redox reactions of a conventional battery produce electricity through the different chemical potentials of the cathode and anode in the electrolyte. however electrolysis requires an external source of electrical energy to induce a chemical reaction and this process takes place in a compartment called an electrolytic cell. edit electrolysis of molten sodium chloride when molten the salt sodium chloride can be electrolyzed to yield metallic sodium and gaseous chlorine. industrially this process takes place in a special cell named down's cell. the cell is connected to an electrical power supply allowing electrons to migrate from the power supply to the electrolytic cell. reactions that take place at down's cell are the following: anode oxidation:  cl  clg   e overall reaction:  na   cll   nal  clg this process can yield large amounts of metallic sodium and gaseous chlorine and is widely used on mineral dressing and metallurgy industries. the emf for this process is approximately  v indicating a very non spontaneous process. in order for this reaction to occur the power supply should provide at least a potential of  v. however larger voltages must be used for this reaction to occur at a high rate. edit electrolysis of water main article: electrolysis of water water can be converted to its component elemental gasses h and o through the application of an external voltage. water doesn't decompose into hydrogen and oxygen spontaneously as the gibbs free energy for the process at standard conditions is about . kj. the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen can be performed in an electrolytic cell. in it a pair of inert electrodes usually made of platinum immersed in water act as anode and cathode in the electrolytic process. the electrolysis starts with the application of an external voltage between the electrodes. this process will not occur except at extremely high voltages without an electrolyte such as sodium chloride or sulfuric acid most used . m. bubbles from the gases will be seen near both electrodes. the following half reactions describe the process mentioned above: anode oxidation:  hol  og   haq   e cathode reduction:  hog   e  hg   ohaq overall reaction:  hol   hg  og although strong acids may be used in the apparatus the reaction will not net consume the acid. while this reaction will work at any conductive electrode at a sufficiently large potential platinum catalyzes both hydrogen and oxygen formation allowing for relatively mild voltages  v depending on the ph. edit electrolysis of aqueous solutions electrolysis in an aqueous is a similar process as mentioned in electrolysis of water. however it is considered to be a complex process because the contents in solution have to be analyzed in half reactions whether reduced or oxidized. edit electrolysis of a solution of sodium chloride the presence of water in a solution of sodium chloride must be examined in respect to its reduction and oxidation in both electrodes. usually water is electrolysed as mentioned in electrolysis of water yielding gaseous oxygen in the anode and gaseous hydrogen in the cathode. on the other hand sodium chloride in water dissociates in na and cl ions cation which is the positive ion will be attracted to the cathode  thus reducing the sodium ion. the anion will then be attracted to the anode  oxidizing chloride ion. the following half reactions describes the process mentioned: . cathode: naaq  e  nas ered  . v . anode:  claq  clg   e ered  . v . cathode:  hol   e  hg   ohaq ered  . v . anode:  hol  og   haq   e ered  . v reaction  is discarded as it has the most negative value on standard reduction potential thus making it less thermodynamically favorable in the process. when comparing the reduction potentials in reactions  and  the reduction of chloride ion is favored. thus if the cl ion is favored for reduction then the water reaction is favored for oxidation producing gaseous oxygen however experiments show gaseous chlorine is produced and not oxygen. although the initial analysis is correct there is another effect that can happen known as the overvoltage effect. additional voltage is sometimes required beyond the voltage predicted by the ecell. this may be due to kinetic rather than thermodynamic considerations. in fact it has been proven that the activation energy for the chloride ion is very low hence favorable in kinetic terms. in other words although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis the rate is so slow that to make the process proceed in a reasonable time frame the voltage of the external source has to be increased hence overvoltage. finally reaction  is favorable because it describes the proliferation of oh ions thus letting a probable reduction of h ions less favorable an option. the overall reaction for the process according to the analysis would be the following: anode oxidation:  claq  clg   e cathode reduction:  hol   e  hg   ohaq overall reaction:  ho   claq  hg  clg   ohaq as the overall reaction indicates the concentration of chloride ions is reduced in comparison to oh ions whose concentration increases. the reaction also shows the production of gaseous hydrogen chlorine and aqueous sodium hydroxide. edit quantitative electrolysis and faraday's laws main article: faraday's law of electrolysis quantitative aspects of electrolysis were originally developed by michael faraday in . faraday is also credited to have coined the terms electrolyte electrolysis among many others while he studied quantitative analysis of electrochemical reactions. also he was an advocate of the law of conservation of energy. faraday concluded after several experiments on electrical current in non spontaneous process the mass of the products yielded on the electrodes was proportional to the value of current supplied to the cell the length of time the current existed and the molar mass of the substance analyzed. in other words the amount of a substance deposited on each electrode of an electrolytic cell is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the cell. below is a simplified equation of faraday's first law: m is the mass of the substance produced at the electrode in grams q is the total electric charge that passed through the solution in coulombs n is the valence number of the substance as an ion in solution electrons per ion m is the molar mass of the substance in grams per mole. faraday devised the laws of chemical electrodeposition of metals from solutions in . he formulated the second law of electrolysis stating the amounts of bodies which are equivalent to each other in their ordinary chemical action have equal quantities of electricity naturally associated with them. in other terms the quantities of different elements deposited by a given amount of electricity are in the ratio of their chemical equivalent weights. an important aspect of the second law of electrolysis is electroplating which together with the first law of electrolysis has a significant number of applications in the industry as when used to protect metals to avoid corrosion. there are various extremely important electrochemical processes in both nature and industry like the coating of objects with metals or metal oxides through electrodeposition and the detection of alcohol in drunken drivers through the redox reaction of ethanol. the generation of chemical energy through photosynthesis is inherently an electrochemical process as is production of metals like aluminum and titanium from their ores. certain diabetes blood sugar meters measure the amount of glucose in the blood through its redox potential. the nervous impulses in neurons are based on electric current generated by the movement of sodium and potassium ions into and out of cells and certain animals like eels can generate a powerful voltage from certain cells that can disable much larger animals. contact tension  a historical forerunner to the theory of electrochemistry. important publications in electrochemistry standard electrode potential data page the spontaneous redox reactions of a conventional battery produce electricity through the different chemical potentials of the cathode and anode in the electrolyte. however electrolysis requires an external source of electrical energy to induce a chemical reaction and this process takes place in a compartment called an electrolytic cell. electrolysis of molten sodium chloride when molten the salt sodium chloride can be electrolyzed to yield metallic sodium and gaseous chlorine. industrially this process takes place in a special cell named down's cell. the cell is connected to an electrical power supply allowing electrons to migrate from the power supply to the electrolytic cell. nameeebbing pp.  reactions that take place at
