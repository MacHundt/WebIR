53	 the constant e occasionly called napiers constant in honor of the scottish mathematician john napier who introduced logarithms is the base of the natural logarithm. it is approximately equal to
 : e 
 it is equal to exp where exp is the exponential function and therefore it is the mathematical of   as n goes to infinity and can
 also be written as the infinite series
 e  sum n!-
 here n! stands for the factorial of n.
 the number e is relevant because one can show that the exponential function expx can be written as ex the exponential function is important because it is up to multiplication by a scalar the unique function which is its own derivative and is hence commonly used to model growth or decay processes.
 the number e is known to be irrational and even transcendental
 it features along with a few other fundamental constants in the most remarkable formula in the world.

53	in the rudest stages of life man depends upon spontaneous animal and vegetable growth for food and clothing and his consumption of such products consequently diminishes the numerical abundance of the species which serve his uses. at more advanced periods he protects and propagates certain esculent vegetables and certain fowls and quadrupeds and at the same time wars upon rival organisms which prey upon these objects of his care or obstruct the increase of their numbers. hence the action of man upon the organic world tends to derange its original balances and while it reduces the numbers of some species or even extirpates them altogether it multiplies other forms of animal and vegetable life. the extension of agricultural and pastoral industry involves an enlargement of the sphere of man's domain by encroachment upon the forests which once covered the greater part of the earth's surface otherwise adapted to his occupation. the felling of the woods has been attended with momentous consequences to the drainage of the soil to the external configuration of its surface and probably also to local climate and the importance of human life as a transforming power is perhaps more clearly demonstrable in the influence man has thus exerted upon superficial geography than in any other result of his material effort. lands won from the woods must be both drained and irrigated river-banks and maritime coasts must be secured by means of artificial bulwarks against inundation by inland and by ocean floods and the needs of commerce require the improvement of natural and the construction of artificial channels of navigation. thus man is compelled to extend over the unstable waters the empire he had already founded upon the solid land. the upheaval of the bed of seas and the movements of water and of wind expose vast deposits of sand which occupy space required for the convenience of man and often by the drifting of their particles overwhelm the fields of human industry with invasions as disastrous as the incursions of the ocean. on the other hand on many coasts sand-hills both protect the shores from erosion by the waves and currents and shelter valuable grounds from blasting sea-winds. man therefore must sometimes resist sometimes promote the formation and growth of dunes and subject the barren and flying sands to the same obedience to his will to which he has reduced other forms of terrestrial surface. besides these old and comparatively familiar methods of material improvement modern ambition aspires to yet grander achievements in the conquest of physical nature and projects are meditated which quite eclipse the boldest enterprises hitherto undertaken for the modification of geographical surface.

53	tegmarks response has been further criticized as it seems to misunderstand the nature and application of ockhams razor . ockhams razor serves as a heuristic discriminator between different viable explanations where the simpler explanation is preferred among other more complex explanations if there is no loss of explanatory power. clearly the many-world interpretation fails to show that it adds any explanatory power compared to other interpretations such as bohmian or copenhagens interpretations. in reverse it is an explanation that invokes a very complex system and also begs the question from where actually these parallel universes actually arise. tegmarks invocation of von neumann seems futile since von neumann also believed that because something outside the calculation was needed to collapse the wave function the collapse was caused by the consciousness of the experimenter von neumann john. mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. princeton: princeton university press. translated by robert t. beyer. . von neumanns idea never gained any popularity and also beg the question not adding anything to the explanation of quantum mechanics and wave-function collapse but it is rather an ad hoc hypothesis and possibly pseudo-scientific. hence the question of where the parallel universes comes from adds a great level of complexity which can be easily avoided by bohmian or copenhagens interpretations.
