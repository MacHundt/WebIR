73	gomtre july   shigeru kondo  alexander j. yee  in contemporary internet culture individuals and organizations frequently pay homage to the number e. for instance in the ipo filing for google in  rather than a typical round-number amount of money the company announced its intention to raise  which is e billion dollars to the nearest dollar. google was also responsible for a billboard that appeared in the heart of silicon valley and later in cambridge massachusetts seattle washington and austin texas. it read first digit prime found in consecutive digits of e.com. solving this problem and visiting the advertised now defunct web site led to an even more difficult problem to solve which in turn led to google labs where the visitor was invited to submit a resume. the first digit prime in e is  which starts at the 99th digit. in another instance the computer scientist donald knuth let the version numbers of his program metafont approach e. the versions are  . . . and so forth.

aliquis pecuni summam fnori exponat ea lege ut singulis momentis pars proportionalis usur annu sorti annumeretur quantum ipsi finito anno debeatur? this is a problem of another kind: the question is if some lender were to invest a sum of money at interest let it accumulate so that at every moment it were to receive a proportional part of its annual interest how much would he be owed at the end of the year? bernoulli constructs a power series to calculate the answer and then writes:   qu nostra serie mathematical expression for a geometric series c. major est.  si ab debebitur plu quam a  minus
