13	 bela lugosi was the stage name of bela ferenc deszo blasko b. october   in lugos hungary d. august   in los angeles california.
 lugosi started his acting career on the stage in europe most notably known for his portrayal of dracula in a stage production of bram stoker's classic vampire story.
 he was most famous for his title role in tod browning's dracula  building on the stage role. the film was a success but lugosi was typecast as a horror heavy with such movies as white zombie and scared to death. later on the acting jobs dried up and he became addicted to morphine.
 late in his life he again got to star in movies albeit lousy ones. ed wood a long-time fan of lugosi's offered him numerous roles in his films always playing some variant of a mad type even in movies in which such a role made no sense  such as glen or glenda. the biographical film ed wood by tim burton portrayed wood's relationship with lugosi who was played by martin landau.
 one of lugosi's most infamous roles was in a movie that was released after he was dead. ed wood's plan  from outer space featured footage of lugosi  who died during filming  interspersed with a double who looked nothing like him and lugosi got top billing for the movie.
 he was also the subject of a song by gothic rock band bauhaus entitled bela lugosi's dead.
 truth being stranger than fiction sometimes bela lugosi was buried in his full dracula costume as per the request in his will.

13	 bo diddley born december   the originator is an influential american blues singer songwriter and guitarist. he was born ellas bates and later took the name ellas mcdaniel after his adoptive mother gussie mcdaniel. he adopted the stage name bo diddley which is probably a southern black slang phrase meaning nothing at all as in he ain't bo diddley. another source says it was his nickname as a golden gloves
 he was given a guitar by his sister as a youth but also took violin lessons. he was inspired to become a blues artist by seeing john lee hooker.
 he is best known for the bo diddley beat a rhumba-based beat also influenced by what is known as hambone a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms legs chest and cheeks while chanting rhymes.
 the beat has been used by many other artists notable johnny otis on willie and the hand jive which is more about hambone than it is a direct copy of bo diddley and buddy holly's not fade away as well as more obscure numbers such as callin all cows by the blues rockers.
 rhythm is so important in bo diddley's music that harmony is often reduced to a bare minimum. his songs for example hey bo diddley and who do you love? often have no chord changes that is they are not written in a musical key and the musicians play and sing in the same chord throughout the piece.
 his own songs have been frequently covered. the animals recorded the story of bo diddley the yardbirds covered im a man and both the woolies and george thorogood had hits with who do you love also a concert favorite of the doors. his road runner one of his two top  hits was also frequently covered. say man was the other top  hit.
 bo diddley used a variety of rhythms however from straight back beat to pop ballad style frequently with maracas by jerome green. he was also an influential guitar player with many special effects and other innovations in tone and attack. he also plays the violin and cello the latter is featured on his mournful instrumental the clock strikes twelve.
 although bo diddley was a breakthrough crossover artist with white audiences appearing on the alan freed concerts for instance he rarely tailored his compositions to teenaged concerns. the most notable exception is probably his album bo diddley's a surfer which featured surfers love call but while bo may never have hung ten in his baggies to catch the big wave he was definitely an influence on surf guitar players.
 his lyrics are often witty and humorous adaptations of folk music themes. his first hit bo diddley was based on the lullaby mockingbird. likewise hey bo diddley is based on the folk song frog went a-courtin. the roots of rap boasting of who do you love? a word play on used many striking lyrics from the african american tradition of toasts and boasts. his two versions of say man have been connected with rap but actually feature the insults known as the dirty dozens: you look like you been in a hatchet fight and everybody had a hatchet except you.
 in addition to the many songs identified with him he wrote the pioneering pop tune love is strange for mickey and sylvia under a pseudonym to increase his royalties.

13	however in the southern states there was a kind of homemade fiddle called a diddley bow. the diddley bow had only one string and was used mostly by poor amateur musicians. it has been suggested that he adapted this name for himself by reversing it perhaps in acknowledgement of his early musical training. the derivation given above that he ain't bo diddley means nothing at all comes ultimately from this instrument and implies that a thing isn't even a makeshift version of what it seems or claims. 
13	 exodus the second book in the torah is also the second book in the tanakh the hebrew bible known to christians as the old testament. it recounts the experience of the hebrew people as they left exodus egypt for the promised land of canaan. moses receives the ten commandments on mt. sinai in exodus : :.

13	 a burns supper is a celebration of the life and poetry of the poet robert burns author of the version of the song auld lang syne which is generally sung at new year. the suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday the january of january although they may in principle be held at any time of the year. they were first held at the end of the 18th century by his friends in memoriam and have been a regular occurrence ever since. they may be formal or informal but they should always be entertaining. the only items which the informal suppers have in common are haggis whisky and perhaps a poem or two. however the formal suppers which are often held by burns clubs follow a standard format which is as follows.
 guests gather and mix as in any informal party.
 the host says a few words welcoming everyone to the supper and perhaps stating the reason for it. the event is declared open.
 everyone is seated at the tables and grace is said using the selkirk grace
 :some hae meat and canna eat
 :and some would eat that want it
 :but we hae meat and we can eat
 :sae let the lord be thankit.
 the supper then starts with the soup course. normally a scots soup such as scotch broth potato soup or cock-a-leekie is served.
 everyone stands as the main course is brought in. this is always a haggis on a large dish. it is brought in by the cook generally while a piper plays bagpipes and leads the way to the host's table where the haggis is laid down. the host or perhaps a guest with a talent then recites to a haggis
 :fair fa your honest sonsie face
 :great chieftain o the puddin-race!
 :aboon them a ye tak your place
 :painch tripe or thairm:
 :weel are ye wordy o a grace
 :as lang's my arm.
 :the groaning trencher there ye fill
 :your hurdies like a distant hill
 :your pin wad help to mend a mill
 :in time o need
 :while thro your pores the dews distil
 :his knife see rustic labour dicht
 :an cut you up wi ready slicht
 :trenching your gushing entrails bricht
 :and then o what a glorious sicht
 :then horn for horn they stretch an strive:
 :deil tak the hindmaist! on they drive
 :till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve
 :are bent like drums
 :then auld guidman maist like to rive
 :is there that o're his french ragout
 :or olio that wad staw a sow
 :or fricassee wad mak her spew
 :looks down wi sneering scornfu view
 :on sic a dinner?
 :poor devil! see him ower his trash
 :as feckless as a wither'd rash
 :his spindle shank a guid whip-lash
 :his nieve a nit
 :thro bloody flood or field to dash
 :but mark the rustic haggis fed
 :the trembling earth resounds his tread.
 :clap in his wallie nieve a blade
 :hell mak it whistle
 :an legs an arms an heads will sned
 :like taps o thristle.
 :ye pow'rs wha mak mankind your care
 :and dish them out their bill o fare
 :auld scotland wants nae skinking ware
 :that jaups in luggies
 :but if ye wish her gratefu prayer
 :gie her a haggis!
 if the poem is being recited with any sense of drama or humour at all then at the line his knife see rustic labour dicht the speaker will normally raise a knife sharpening it menacingly and at the line an cut you up wi ready slicht plunges it into the haggis and cuts it open from end to end. when done properly this ceremony is a highlight of the evening.
 at the end of the poem a whisky toast will be proposed to the haggis. then the company will sit and enjoy the meal. the main course is of course haggis and is traditionally served with mashed potatoes and mashed turnip. a dessert course cheese courses coffee etc. may also be part of the meal. the courses normally use traditional scottish recipes.
 when the meal reaches the coffee stage various speeches and toasts are given. in order the core speeches and toasts are as follows.
 one of the guests gives a short speech remembering some aspect of burns life or poetry. this may be light-hearted or intensely serious. the speaker should always prepare a speech with his audience in mind since above all the burns supper should be entertaining.
 a toast to robert burns is drunk.
 this was originally a short speech given by a male guest in thanks to those women who had prepared the meal. however nowadays it is much more wide ranging and generally covers the male speaker's view on women. it is normally amusing but should never be offensive particularly bearing in mind that it will be followed by a reply from the lassies concerned.
 a toast to the women's health is drunk by the men.
  reply to the toast to the lassies 
 like the previous toast this is generally quite wide ranging nowadays. in it a female guest will give her views on men and reply to any specific points raised by the previous speaker. like the previous speech this should be amusing but not offensive.
 a toast to the men's health is drunk by the women.
 these may follow if desired. there is no fixed list of subjects.
 after the speeches there may be singing of songs by burns  ae fond kiss parcel o rogues a man's a man etc  and more poetry  to a mouse tam o shanter the twa dugs holy willie's prayer etc. this may be done by the individual guests or by invited experts. it goes on for as long as the guests wish.
 there may occasionally be scottish country dancing if the venue allows but this is not a normal part of a burns supper.
 finally the host will wind things up and ask everyone to stand join hands and sing auld lang syne which brings the evening to an end.
 burns suppers are most common in scotland but they occur where-ever there are burns clubs expatriate scots or indeed lovers of burns poetry.

13	electronic commerce also referred to as ec e-commerce or ecommerce consists primarily of the distributing buying selling marketing and servicing of product or services over electronic system such as the and other computer networks. the information technology industry might see it as an electronic business application aimed at commercial transactions in this context it can involve electronic funds transfer supply chain management e-marketing online marketing online transaction processing electronic data interchange edi automated inventory management systems and automated data collection systems. electronic commerce typically uses electronic communications technology of the world wide web at some point in the transaction's lifecycle although of course electronic commerce frequently depends on computer technologies other than the world wide web such as databases and e-mail and on other non computer technologies such as transportation for physical goods sold via e-commerce. according to forrester research as cited in kessler  electronic commerce in the united states generated sales worth u.s. . billion in as of . the meaning of the term electronic commerce has changed over the last  years. originally electronic commerce meant the facilitation of commercial transactions electronically usually using technology like electronic data interchange edi and electronic funds transfer eft where both were introduced in the late 1970s, for example to send commercial documents like purchase orders or invoices electronically. the electronic or e in e-commerce refers to the the commerce refers to be traditional business models. e-commerce is as the complete set of processes that support activities on a network. in the 1970s and 1980s, this would also have involved information analysis. the growth and acceptance of credit cards teller machines atm and telephone banking in the 1980s were also forms of e-commerce. however from the 1990s onwards this would include enterprise resource planning systems erp data mining and data warehousing. in the dot-com com era it came to include activities more precisely termed web commerce  the purchase of goods and services over the world wide web usually with secure connection https a special server protocol that confidential ordering data for customer protection with e-shopping carts and with electronic payment services like credit card payment authorizations. today it encompasses a very wide range of business activities and processes from e-banking to offshore manufacturing to e-logistics. the ever growing dependence of modern industries on electronically enabled business processes gave impetus to the growth and development of supporting systems including backend systems applications and middleware. examples are broadband and fiber-optic networks supply-chain management software customer relationship management software inventory control systems and financial accounting software. when the web first became well-known among the general public in  many journalists and pundits forecast that e-commerce would soon become a major economic sector. however it took about four years for security protocols like https to become sufficiently developed and widely deployed. subsequently between  and  a substantial number of businesses in the united states and western europe developed rudimentary web sites. although a large number of pure e-commerce companies disappeared during the dot-com collapse in  and  many brick-and-mortar retailers recognized that such companies had identified valuable niche markets and began to add e-commerce capabilities to their web sites. for example after the collapse of online grocer webvan two traditional supermarket chains albertsons and safeway both started e-commerce subsidiaries through which consumers could order groceries online. the emergence of e-commerce also significantly lowered barriers to entry in the selling of many types of goods accordingly many small home-based proprietors are able to use the to sell goods. a famous one would be ebaytm. success factors in e-commerce technical and organizational aspects in many cases an e-commerce company will survive not only based on its product but by having a competent management team good post-sales services well-organized business structure network infrastructure and a secured well designed website. such factors include: sufficient work done in market research and analysis. e-commerce is not exempt from good business planning and the fundamental laws of supply and demand. business failure is as much a reality in e-commerce as in any other form of business. a good management team armed with good and sound information technology strategy. a company's it strategy should be a part of the business re-design process. providing an easy and secured way for customers to effect transactions. credit cards are the most popular means of sending payments on the accounting for  of online purchases. in the past card numbers were transferred securely between the customer and merchant through independent payment gateways. such independent payment gateways are still used by most small and home businesses. most merchants today process credit card transactions on site through arrangements made with commercial banks or credit cards companies. providing reliability and security. parallel servers hardware redundancy fail technology information encryption and firewall can enhance this requirement. providing a degree view of the customer relationship defined as ensuring that all employees suppliers and partners have a complete view and the same view of the customer. however customers may not appreciate the brother experience. constructing a commercially sound business model. if this key success factor had appeared in textbooks in  many of the dot-coms might not have gone into bankruptcy. engineering an electronic value chain in which one focuses on a limited number of core competencies  the opposite of a one-stop shop. electronic stores can appear either specialist or generalist if properly programmed. operating on or near the cutting edge of technology and staying there as technology changes but remembering that the fundamentals of commerce remain indifferent to technology. setting up an organization of sufficient alertness and agility to respond quickly to any changes in the economic social and physical environment. providing an attractive website. the tasteful use of colour graphics animation photographs fonts and white-space percentage may aid success in this respect. streamlining business processes possibly through engineering and information technologies. providing complete understanding of the products or services offered which not only includes complete product information but also sound advisors and selectors. naturally the e-commerce vendor must also perform such mundane tasks as being truthful about its product and its availability shipping reliably and handling complaints promptly and effectively. a unique property of the environment is that individual customers have access to far more information about the seller than they would find in brick-and-mortar situation. a successful e-commerce organization must also provide an enjoyable and rewarding experience to its customers. many factors go into making this possible. such factors include: providing value to customers. vendors can achieve this by offering a product or product-line that attracts potential customers at a competitive price as in non-electronic commerce. providing service and performance. offering a responsive user-friendly purchasing experience just like a flesh-and-blood retailer may go some way to achieving these goals. providing an incentive for customers to buy and to return. sales promotions to this end can involve coupons special offers and discounts and cross-linked websites and affiliate affiliate programs can also help. providing personal attention. personalized web sites purchase suggestions and personalized special offers may go some of the way to substituting for the face-to-face human interaction found at a traditional point of sale. providing a sense of community. chat rooms internet boards soliciting customer input and loyalty programs sometimes called affinity programs can help in this respect. owning the customer's total experience. e-tailers foster this by treating any contacts with a customer as part of a total experience an experience that becomes synonymous with the brand. letting customers help themselves. provision of a self-serve site easy to use without assistance can help in this respect. this implies that all product information is available cross-sell information advise for product alternatives and supplies  accessory selectors. helping customers do their job of e-tailers and online shopping directories can provide such help through ample comparative information and good search facilities. provision of component information and safety-and-health comments may assist e-tailers to define the customers job. even if a provider of e-commerce goods and services rigorously follows these key factors to devise an exemplary e-commerce strategy problems can still arise. sources of such problems include: failure to understand customers why they buy and how they buy. even a product with a sound value proposition can fail if producers and retailers do not understand customer habits expectations and motivations. e-commerce could potentially mitigate this potential problem with proactive and focused marketing research just as traditional retailers may do. failure to consider the competitive situation. one may have the will to construct a viable book e-tailing business model but lack the capability to compete with amazon.com. inability to predict environmental reaction. what will competitors do? will they introduce competitive brands or competitive web sites? will they supplement their service offerings? will they try to sabotage a competitor's site? will price wars break out? what will the government do? research into competitors industries and markets may mitigate some consequences here just as in non-electronic commerce. over-estimation of resource competence. can staff hardware software and processes handle the proposed strategy? have e-tailers failed to develop employee and management skills? these issues may call for thorough resource planning and employee training. failure to coordinate. if existing reporting and control relationships do not suffice one can move towards a flat accountable and flexible organizational structure which may or may not aid coordination. failure to obtain senior management commitment. this often results in a failure to gain sufficient corporate resources to accomplish a task. it may help to get top management involved right from the start. failure to obtain employee commitment. if planners do not explain their strategy well to employees or fail to give employees the whole picture then training and setting up incentives for workers to embrace the strategy may assist. under-estimation of time requirements. setting up an e-commerce venture can take considerable time and money and failure to understand the timing and sequencing of tasks can lead to significant cost overruns. basic project planning critical path critical chain or pert analysis may mitigate such failings. profitability may have to wait for the achievement of market share. failure to follow a plan. poor follow-through after the initial planning and insufficient tracking of progress against a plan can result in problems. one may mitigate such problems with standard tools: benchmarking milestones variance tracking and penalties and rewards for variances. becoming the victim of organized crime. many syndicates have caught on to the potential of the internet as a new revenue stream. two main methods are as follows:  using identity theft techniques like phishing to order expensive goods and bill them to some innocent person then liquidating the goods for quick cash  extortion by using a network of compromised zombie computers to engage in denial-of-service denial of service attacks against the target web site until it starts paying protection money. certain products or services appear more suitable for online sales others remain more suitable for offline sales. many successful purely virtual companies deal with digital products including information storage retrieval and modification music movies office supplies education communication software photography and financial transactions. examples of this type of company include: google ebay and paypal. other successful marketers such as use drop shipping or affiliate marketing techniques to facilitate transactions of tangible goods without maintaining real inventory. examples include amazing refund and numerous sellers on dropship your way to ebay success. virtual marketers can sell some non-digital products and services successfully. such products generally have a high value-to-weight ratio they may involve embarrassing purchases they may typically go to people in remote locations and they may have shut-ins as their typical purchasers. items which can fit through a standard letterbox  such as music cds dvds and books  are particularly suitable for a virtual marketer and indeed amazon.com one of the few enduring dot-com companies has historically concentrated on this field. products such as spare parts both for consumer items like washing machines and for industrial equipment like centrifugal pumps also seem good candidates for selling online. retailers often need to order spare parts specially since they typically do not stock them at consumer outlets  in such cases e-commerce solutions in spares do not compete with retail stores only with other ordering systems. a factor for success in this niche can consist of providing customers with exact reliable information about which part number their particular version of a product needs for example by providing parts lists keyed by serial number. purchases of pornography and of other sex-related products and services fulfill the requirements of both virtuality or if non-virtual generally high-value and potential embarrassment unsurprisingly provision of such services has become the most profitable segment of e-commerce.  products less suitable for e-commerce include products that have a low value to-weight ratio products that have a smell taste or touch component products that need trial fittings  most notably clothing  and products where colour integrity appears important. nonetheless has had success delivering groceries in the united albeit that many of its goods are of a generic quality and clothing sold through the internet is big business in the u.s. also the recycling program cheapcycle sells goods over the internet but avoids the low value-to-weight ratio problem by creating different groups for various regions so that shipping costs remain low. consumers have accepted the e-commerce business model less readily than its proponents originally expected. even in product categories suitable for e-commerce electronic shopping has developed only slowly. several reasons might account for the slow uptake including:  concerns about security. many people will not use credit cards over the internet due to concerns about theft and credit card fraud.  lack of instant gratification with most e-purchases non-digital purchases. much of a consumer's reward for purchasing a product lies in the instant gratification of using and displaying that product. this reward does not exist when one's purchase does not arrive for days or weeks.  the problem of access to web commerce mainly for poor households and for developing countries. low diffusion rates of internet access in some sectors greatly reduces the potential for e-commerce.  the social aspect of shopping. some people enjoy talking to sales staff to other shoppers or to their cohorts: this social reward side of retail therapy does not exist to the same extent in online shopping.  poorly designed bug-infested e-commerce web sites that frustrate online shoppers and drive them away.  inconsistent return policies among e-tailers or difficulties in

13	 earthdawn is a fantasy role-playing game or rpg produced originally by fasa and has since been passed on to living room games.
 the game differs from the fantasy troupe of games such as dungeons  dragons but draws heavily upon games such as runequest.
 the game is tightly bound to its setting a fantasy called barsaive.
 in synopsis the game world has suffered an invasion from otherworld dimensions by a race called simply horrors that have scoured the land of life.
 the players take the role of survivors who having hidden from the slaughter in magical shelters and are now emerging to explore the land and discover what has happened in their absence.
 the game has an intricate history that helps set the tone and goals of the adventures that the explorers can undertake.
 the key points of the history are the prediction of the disaster the creation of an empire in attempt to ready the population for its coming and the subsequent differences between the actual events and the predictions.
 it's an interesting idea to create characters who have been living in underground shelters for most of their lives before emerging to reclaim a world most only knew by stories told by their grandparents and pictures seen in books.
 barsaive is a region of city-states but the two major power groups are the dwarves of throal in the north-east and the
 theran empire who's capitol city is on an island to the south of barsaive and who controls much of south-west barsaive.
 the empire had taught the people of the barsaive how to survive the astral attack in return for their surrender and addition to the empire and the dwarves were some of their most astute students.
 however once the danger was past the dwarves decided to rebel and set up their own independent kingdom.
 when the therans returned to the barsaive they faced a rebellion against their distant rule.
 the therans in the area are based in the magical floating city of sky point while the dwarven realm's capital is the underground city of throal.
 earthdawn's magic system is simultaneously earthdawn's most innovative and most derivative aspect.
 it is highly varied but its essential idea that everyone has access to magic particularly that used to perform their jobs and assist in daily tasks is borrowed almost wholesale from runequest.
 similarly runequest sorcerers can be seen to have a strong influence on earthdawn's astral magic users.
 one of the most innovative ideas in earthdawn is how magical items work.
 simply pick up a magical item and it works exactly like a mundane item of the same type.
 if you spend experience to activate the item however you unlock some of the magic in the item.
 by adding more experience you can unlock more and more power within the item. most items have a ceiling where adding more experience doesn't help it but that ceiling is different in different items as are which powers that the item grants.
 a common magical broadsword may only have  magical ranks and only increases the damage of the blade while the legendary sword purifier which has slain countless horrors has  magical ranks and adds numerous powers to it's wielder to-hit damage physical defense and spell defense to name a few.
 despite the similarities to runequest earthdawn's ideas and particularly its integration of the setting's magical philosophy into the game's rule system are distinctive and enjoyable.
 fasa closed down production of earthdawn in january .
 in late  the fasa allowed living room games to continue with the product through a licensing agreement.
 there have been  adventures since that point as well as earthdawn 2nd edition and the 2nd edition companion jan .
 the 2nd edition does not alter the setting except for moving it forward a few years to show the metaplot advancement.
 there are a few rules changes in 2nd edition some classes have slightly different or altered abilities as compared to the original but otherwise it's the same game.

13	and release the original fasa books in pdf form. the earthdawn player's and gamemaster's compendia are since each books has over  pages and summarizes everything fasa didnot only the gemae-mechanics but also the setting narrations and stories. for example each discipline has its own chapter describing it from the point of of different adepts. likewise barsaive gets a complete treatment and the chapters contain a lot of log entries and stories in addition to the setting descriptions the same applies also to horrors and dragons. while tried to remain faithful to fasa's vision and tried to keep the visual style they revised almost everything introduced some new material only to fill gaps. 
13	i.e. a fictionalized version of earth earlier. indeed the map of barsaive and its neighboring established that most of the game takes place where the ukraine and adjacent russia are in our world. however the topography other than coastlines and major rivers is quite different and the only apparent reference to the real world besides the map may be the blood wood known as wyrm wood before the scourge and similar in location and extent to the ukrainian for wormwood zone of alienation.

13	the greatest blunder of science: electric charge is a synonym for geometric area. its fundamental si unit coulomb is a synonym for square meter . basic quantities and units of electricity . the charge of the basic photon qp is a new fundamental constant . the fundamental unit of charge e is geometric area of the electron charge  geometric area in the following an impeccable and irrevocable mathematical proof will be presented that is based on the methodological principle of mathematical formalism namely the principle of inner consistence and lack of contradiction: it will be shown that electric charge is not an intrinsic property of matter as is believed in physics today but a synonym for geometric area and that the si unit coulomb is a synonym for square meter. physics is essentially mathematics applied to the physical world. all known physical laws are expressed as mathematical equations. all fundamental physical constants according to which nature functions as an ordered whole result from mathematical equations. the si system is for instance a surrogate anthropocentric system with the help of which all the quantities and basic units of physics are introduced through their method of definition and measurement. it is a simple mathematical method of building a priori theoretical numerical relationships and their posteriori measurement through experiments in the real physical world. therefore the si system can be substituted by any other arbitrary reference system as it does not contribute to our physical knowledge on nature. all the si units and their measurements are per definition dimensionless quotients numbers. it is a pure convention to attach the name of si units to a numerical result e.g. m 1s, c j. for instance when we say that an object has a mass of m  kg we have actually compared its gravitational weight force with that of a reference object with the unit mass of mr  kg hence      dimensionless number. without the ability of presenting physical phenomena in terms of mathematical relations and equations the physical world would be incommensurable and hence incomprehensible to human mind and physics would not have been the exact natural science we know it today. this is basic knowledge that any person with a modest understanding of physics and science should possess. . basic quantities and units of electricity the above observations hold true for the two basic quantities of electricity and their si units  charge q with the si unit coulomb c and current i with the si unit ampere. they are defined within the si system in a circular manner so that they can be reduced to one fundamental dimensionless quantity and unit e.g. charge:  the si unit of charge is the coulomb which is defined in terms of the unit of electric current the ampere the ampere is defined in terms of a magnetic-force measurement . the coulomb c is the amount of charge flowing through a cross-sectional area a of a wire in one second when the current in the wire is one ampere. ref.  if q is the charge that flows through the cross-sectional area a in time t the current is i  the si unit of current is the ampere a: a  ref. this circular tautological definition of the two fundamental quantities of electricity charge and current within the si system is based on the geometric method of measurement of their units. practically it is based on the definition and measurement of the electromagnetic force. this force is also called electromotive force emf. the classical definition of electric charge and current as quoted above implements mathematics in an inconsistent way and introduces a systemic flaw in electricity that extends throughout the whole edifice of physics. this has not been realized so far. when the non-mathematical definition of electric current  is presented in mathematical symbols in physics the quantity cross-sectional area a is omitted without any reason: i  this omission in the mathematical presentation of the current is a fundamental formalistic mistake with grievous cognitive consequences for this discipline. this becomes evident when we express the present formula of the current in non-mathematical terms: electric current i is the charge q that flows during the time t or alternatively: current is charge per time. this definition is meaningless as physics does not know what charge is ref.. in reality the current is measured in relation to the cross-sectional area a of the conductor according to the principle of circular argument. the latter is the only operational method with which all known physical quantities are initially defined within mathematics and then measured in a secondary manner in the real physical world. as we have shown above for charge and current this procedure is the foundation of the si system  it is the universal method of definition and measurement of all physical quantities and their corresponding si units. the principle of circular argument works as follows: for each specific physical quantity defined in an a priori mathematical manner in the mind a real physical system is chosen as a reference system and its specific quantity e.g. energy force space time etc. is assigned the number one  . this is a basic mathematical procedure primary axiom that allows the application of mathematics to real objects. in the above definition of charge the reference system is the cross-sectional area a of the wire which can be experimentally measured. the charge is then defined as a relationship to a. when a   the cross-sectional area may disappear optically as a quantity from the mathematical equation of the current but it is still part of its theoretical definition. physical relationships can only be built between identical quantities. there is no exception to this rule. relationships between heterogeneous quantities are meaningless unless they are associated with conversion factors that establish the equality of dimensions in a physical equation. such conversion factors are often defined in physics as natural constants. these are basic formalistic considerations regarding the application of mathematics in physics that are made for the first time in this theoretical clarity although they have been intuitively followed in conventional physics unfortunately not in a consistent way as has been shown for the definition of charge above. it is a basic axiomatic knowledge that it is sufficient to introduce only one wrong statement in a mathematical system to bias the whole system. this knowledge as proven by gdel in  ref. has undermined hilberts formalism with which the consistency of mathematics ought to be proven by finite procedures grundlagenkrise der mathematik foundation crisis of mathematics. such mathematically inconsistent statements and definitions can often be encountered in present day physics. their existence and uncritical application have so far hindered the unification of physics. at present physics as a scientific categorical system cannot adequately reflect the unity of nature  for instance gravitation cannot be integrated with the other three fundamental forces in the standard model. when mathematical formalism is applied to physics respectively to electricity in a consistent way the correct presentation of the above definition of electric current and of its unit ampere should include the cross-sectional area a as this quantity is explicitly introduced as a reference system in the definition: when we set for the time   e.g. as a dimensionless number t  1s, in equation  we obtain for the current unit  ampere   in this case the fundamental si unit coulomb is defined as a relationship to one square meter this si unit meter for length  d-space assesses geometric area  d-space d for space dimension. therefore the definition of electric charge through the definition and measurement of its si unit coulomb is a hidden tautological definition of geometric area respectively square meter. in order to fully comprehend equation  we must explain from a mathematical formalistic point of view what the unit  ampere really means. as with all physical definitions the current definition of this unit is at the same time the method of measurement of the corresponding quantity electric current: if two very long parallel wires one meter apart carry equal currents the current in each is defined to be one ampere when the force per unit length on each wire is ref. the interaction between the two wires takes place at a distance of r  m and is mediated through the magnetic fields which are built around the two equal electric segments: il  il where l  l  l  m and i  i   ampere. when the currents flow in the same direction the wires are attracted when the currents are anti-parallel the wires are repelled. this motion is assessed as an electromotive force emf. this interaction was first discovered by oersted who observed the effect of a current on a compass needle and was experimentally confirmed by ampre for parallel and anti-parallel currents: f ii   nm  where    and i  i   ampere  ii  . as we see the definition of ampere resorts to the number  as the universal symbol of presenting physical quantities and their dimensions as units of the si system e.g. c a m 1s, etc. with such units all actual magnitudes are measured as relationships in the real physical world. in reality equation  is a hidden definition of the basic constant of electricity the permeability of free space mo: the experimental definition of electric current illustrates the ubiquitous fact that electromagnetism can be adequately assessed through simple interactions between material electric systems. while classical mechanics deals with gravitational interactions electromagnetism focuses on electromagnetic interactions. both kinds of interactions are mediated by fields  they are actions at a distance  so that any material system can simultaneously exhibit gravitational and electromagnetic properties. all kinds of interactions observed in physics are energy interactions. force f is a useful mathematically defined quantity with which any energy interaction can be properly assessed. when one speaks in physics for instance of the four fundamental forces one means in reality the corresponding basic energies such as gravitational electromagnetic weak or nuclear energy. force is often used in physics as a synonym for energy although it is a different mathematical quantity f  this is another common verbal descriptive inconsistency in mathematical definitions that biases the theory of physics and hinders its axiomatic unification. the measurement of the electromagnetic force that is acting on the two segments is therefore a measurement of the field energy resulting from this interaction: e  fs  f when s  m  . according to the fundamental mathematical axiom of reducibility ref. this energy can be mathematically expressed as the product of the interaction of the two currents e  ii. departing from the principle of circular argument we can assign this energy the primary number  e.g. as  joule with respect to the si system: we have deduced this equation axiomatically from our mathematical consciousness. it is valid for all energy interactions in the real physical world. the axiom of reducibility is thus the universal mathematical procedure with which all physical laws and other mathematical equations are derived in physics. this theoretical insight results from the consistent implementation of mathematical formalism in current physical theory as it has evolved throughout history. this elementary formalistic finding which any person with a modest knowledge of physics can easily deduce for himself is at present not explicitly comprehended by scientists. this is especially true for the mathematical definition of all si units. as discussed above the method of definition and measurement of the current si unit ampere is entirely based on mathematics respectively geometry  therefore it should confirm the above equation. indeed when we solve equation  for the energy: we obtain our axiomatically anticipated result see also equation . from a formalistic mathematical point of view the actual definition of the current si unit  ampere can be rewritten as follows: when the exchanged energy between two equal arbitrarily defined electric currents segments placed at a distance of m is  joule per second explicit introduction of the si system as a mathematical method of measurement m for space 1s for time and joule ms for energy space-time the energy of each electric segment can be defined as a basic unit of  ampere: when t  1s, the si unit of current is ampere  m  d-space  area within mathematical formalism. the current definition of ampere is thus an arbitrary decision with respect to the surrogate si system meter and second and can be substituted by any other definition and system of reference. it is important to observe that this definition is independent of the wire material  it holds in any kind of conductor. the implications of this well known fact have been overlooked in the theory of electromagnetism. it reveals the a priori mathematical character of this or any other physical definition which can be confirmed by an experiment in a secondary manner. another important theoretical aspect of the conventional definition of the basic unit ampere is the assumption that the interaction occurs between two very long actually infinitely long wires. this definition is based on the idea that the parallel axiom of geometry is correct. however this basic axiom could not be proven so far. this physical definition is thus a definition by abstraction  by erroneously assuming the validity of the parallel axiom within empty euclidean space which is generally used as a reference system in physics. this becomes evident when we consider the fact that the two electric segments either attract or repel themselves. when this motion is considered it is obvious that the real wires cannot remain parallel to each other in the infinity of real space-time that is different from empty euclidean space. it is a well known fact that real space-time exhibits gravitational and electromagnetic forces energies in the form of long range correlations fields at any time and point  for instance space is bent by gravitational forces. this knowledge is basic to the theory of relativity. precisely for this reason the parallel axiom cannot be valid in the real physical world. if we now present the conventional circular definition of the electric current i   in terms of geometry we acquire in a logical manner the following simple statement: electric current i is geometric area q per time t. however this formula is incomplete  as already said it does not include the cross-sectional area a without which the definition of the current is meaningless. when we consider this quantity we arrive at the following consistent definition of charge: electric charge is a two-dimensional quantity of space d-space which is obtained in relation to a well defined area according to the principle of circular argument usually measured as a cross-sectional area of the conductor: at this place it is very important to observe that when we compare two d-space-quantities we can either write d-space or a dimensionless number for this relationship. for instance the area of a soccer field xm is a ratio to the arbitrary unit area of m which can either be expressed as a number n    in mathematics or an area  d-space  m in geometry. alternatively we can substitute the meter with an inch the relationship between the two areas the soccer field and the square meter remains the same. we conclude: all physical quantities are numerical dimensionless relationships between two real systems one of them being usually defined as a reference system and are thus independent of the choice of the reference unit. it is precisely this universal formalistic procedure with which all kinds of numbers are introduced and defined in the theory of mathematics see meta-mathematics. purely for this reason we can eliminate the surrogate si system and operate only with dimensionless numbers without changing anything in physics. this insight affects probably the greatest simplification in science as the application of the si system extends throughout the whole edifice of natural sciences. in equation  the cross-sectional area a is the reference magnitude that can be easily determined. the actual area of the charges in motion e.g. the cross-sectional area of the electromagnetic waves in motion in the conductor as geometrically assessed by the wave equation of classical and quantum mechanics is practically not known. it is obtained in relation to the cross-sectional area of the conductor which we can precisely measure principle of circular argument. thus the measurement of the electric current is in reality an indirect measurement of the area of the particles or waves in motion see wave-particle dualism. these can be electrons protons ions or macroscopic assemblies of particles such as solenoids of electric generators motors or transformers. these devices can only operate when they are in circular motion. when there is no motion that is when no charge cross-sectional area flows there is no current and hence no visible energy interaction. this holds true for the electric current as well as for the water current  both are distinct sources of energy. based on the conventional definition we have proven that charge is area. we shall now present some fundamental derivations that confirm this conclusion. these derivations are based on well known experimental and theoretical results. in particular we shall prove that the equivalence between one coulomb and one square meter holds for the charge of the electron which is defined as the fundamental unit of charge e or elementary charge e to which all other charges are set in relation  n. . the charge of the basic photon qp is a new fundamental constant all natural constants in physics are the result of mathematical equations that can be experimentally verified in the real physical world. some constants are defined as fundamental fundamental constants others are expressed as derivatives of one or several already known constants. this discrimination is artificial and does not take into account the fact that all constants and physical quantities being linked to each other in mathematical equations are obtained in a circular mathematical manner as already shown for the si system above. we shall now prove both mathematically and physically that the charge area qp of the basic photon h also known as plancks constant is the elementary area that builds the charge area e of the electron. in this way we shall prove the inhomogeneity of electric structures as this is observed for the electric charges of quarks. the knowledge that charge is area is very useful in explaining the charges of quarks which are fractions of e. until now this fact cannot be explained by qcd. thus the new correct interpretation of the quantity charge has a fundamental theoretical impact not only on electromagnetism but also on qed quantum electrodynamics and qcd quantum chromodynamics. this idea is basic to bohr model of energy quantization of the hydrogen atom. the charge area of the basic photon qp is a new fundamental constant that can be obtained within mathematical formalism being the universal method of definition and measurement of all physical quantities and natural constants from the charge of the electron e by introducing according to the principle of circular argument another natural constant  the compton wavelength of the electron ce  .  m ref. presented as compton frequency fce   .s- the charge of the basic photon can be therefore regarded as the most elementary area of matter which we can measure or discriminate at present. we shall now perform a collection of derivations within mathematics that will include some basic quantities and equations of electricity to prove this mathematical conclusion. for this purpose we can imagine qp as the cross-sectional area of the basic photon h when the latter is defined as a transversal electromagnetic wave that is propagated with the speed of light c. we can thus present the structure of the basic photon as an area integral of the basic photon when it is considered a standing wave with the wavelength of l  xm. this quantity is obtained within geometry and can be replaced by any other quantity of area. this geometric procedure is very common in wave theory notwithstanding the fact that this has not been apprehended by physicists from a formalistic point of view. the discussion of this important theoretical aspect is however beyond the scope of the present disquisition. we use this quantity because it is basic to the conventional geometric derivation of some important quantities of magnetism such as bohr magneton ref.: in this case qpa  nxm  a is square circumference and bohr magneton is defined as the area of a circle. we shall show below that this circle is attributed to the electron. we must observe on this occasion that physicists are not aware of this hidden geometric definition of bohr magneton which is a fundamental constant of electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. they believe that this quantity is an intrinsic property of matter as is the case with any other physical quantity at present. from bohr magneton the atomic magnetic moments are derived in the theory of magnetism of matter. equation  confirms that any traditional quantity of material particles can only be defined in relation to the space-time of the photon level in most cases to the space-time of the basic photon h. this system appears to be the initial real reference system to which all other basic physical quantities and si units are compared for further information see the current definition of second and meter in si system. bohr magneton is a fundamental constant area from which the magnetic moments areas of the elementary particles are obtained within mathematical formalism and subsequently confirmed in experiments ref.. thus equations  and  include the derivation of five basic constants of physics from the new constant the charge area of the basic photon qp by employing the formalistic principle of mathematics:  the fundamental unit of charge e  bohr magneton mb the magnetic moments of: the formulae and values of the last three constants can be obtained from any textbook on physics. the unification of these five basic constants was made possible for the first time in the history of physics by introducing the new basic constant qp. this is a powerful confirmation of the validity of our methodological formalistic approach as the above mentioned constants can be experimentally measured. thus the validity of the new constant the charge area of the basic photon qp can also be experimentally confirmed. ultimately the axiomatic mathematical principle of inner consistency and lack of contradiction which we have followed in the present elaboration is confirmed by experience in an irrevocable manner. mathematical theory formalism and empiricism are hence dialectical aspects of the unity of nature. this is true science. in the formula of bohr magneton  the wavelength a of the basic photon is intuitively assessed as a circumference. this seems logical when one considers the fact that each wave is a product of rotation. as all motions are rotations any distance which we define as a d-space-quantity is in fact a closed path that can be ideally expressed as the circumference of a circular motion. this approach has been used for the first time by kepler to formulate his third law of gravitation. it is indeed a very common practice in physics. particularly in electromagnetism it leads to the definition of magnetic moments see above. the classical and quantum wave equation is entirely based on this simple geometric idea. as any straight line is a section of a circumference when it is assigned to real space-time we can present any amplitude a maximal expansion of a wave as a circumference. the square circumference is thus an abstract quantity of d-space called charge. this is the degree of freedom of mathematical consciousness  or in the context of current physics the degree of freedom of the unanalysed consciousness of physicists max born. this approach is the actual method of definition of the elementary charge e. geometry is obviously the hidden method of the current definition of this basic constant of electricity. we shall prove this fact below in detail. . the fundamental unit of charge e is geometric area of the electron. in equation  the spatial structure of the basic photon a  qpa is presented as square circumference a in this case qp  n see the principle of mathematical presentation above. this geometric quantity assesses the maximal extension of this system of space-time in terms of area. it is simple geometry applied to the real world. although this fact has not so far been realized by physicists the same mathematical approach has been used to assess the spatial structure of the electron. in order to unveil this hidden definition we must depart from pauli exclusion principle pauli-verbot. it postulates that no two electrons of an atom can acquire the same quantum condition that is determined by the four quantum numbers n l m and ms. these numbers are believed to describe the spatial configuration of electrons in the atom. in fact pauli principle is an interpretation of schrdinger wave equation of quantum mechanics as presented in fermi-dirac statistics. according to it all fermions e.g. electrons protons and neutrons have an asymmetric function that is they have a half-integral spin and obey the exclusion principle while all bosons e.g. photons have a symmetric function ref.. what is the vested knowledge behind such cryptic definitions which are evidently of mathematical origin? we shall explain this for the first time for the basic photon and electron. the basic photon h is regarded as a transversal harmonic wave that results from a circular motion. although the actual sources of this circular motion are not an object of study in modern physics the basic photon is actually regarded as a sphere with the square circumference of a  qpa see equations   . according to pauli exclusion principle the electron is considered a standing asymmetric wave that acquires the form of a hemisphere with the surface area se of where so is the area of the sphere and d is the diameter. if we set the compton wavelength of the electron lce which is d-space-quantity of this system equal to the hypothetical diameter of the electron we obtain for the area of the electron hemisphere a value that is almost equal to that of bohr magneton : the small difference results from the fact that real systems are open and cannot have the form of real spheres which are abstract closed systems but are rather elliptical see keplers laws. from the equivalence between the area of the electron hemisphere and bohr magneton  se  mb  we obtain the following equation see also equation : qpa   a    ce  when we solve this equation for the elementary charge e: we obtain the area charge of the electron in relation to the area charge of the basic photon according to the principle of circular argument: ce a  squared wavelength  d-space  n in this case fce  n. observe that  is also a length relationship p  c is circumference so that it should be strictly speaking given in meters in geometry as is done with all other length quantities. this is another basic formalistic inconsistency in physics which has hindered an understanding that this discipline is essentially applied geometry to the real physical world. we conclude: the elementary charge e is area: e  .x-m. the si unit of charge coulomb is identical to the square si unit of space meter: this irrevocable physical and mathematical result explains for the first time why coulomb is considered a very big unit when applied to particles and has been largely replaced with the si unit electronvolt ref.. this new insight affects probably the greatest simplification of our physical outlook not only from a theoretical but also from a practical point of view as many motors and machines used in daily life are electrically driven. at the same time it reveals the most awkward mistake of physics  its decision to introduce the term electric charge as a synonym for geometric area without realizing the epistemological background of this fundamental quantity of electricity. from this disquisition we can finally conclude that electricity and electromagnetism are applied geometry to the electromagnetic levels of space time  they are simple studies of the geometric form of electric systems. the same holds true for most of physics. since this kind of geometry has been fully developed in antiquity it is difficult to perceive what kind of progress science in general and physics in particular have actually accomplished in the meantime. . tipler pa physics worth publ. new york p. . . tipler pa p. . . tipler pa german ed. p.

13	 the electron microscope can magnify very small details due to the use of electrons rather than light to scatter off material magnifying at levels up to . times.
 the first electron microscope was built in  by ernst ruska.
 it was greatly developed through the 1950s and has allowed great advances in the sciences.
 the advantage of an electron beam is that it has a much smaller wavelength see wave-particle duality which allows a higher resolution  the measure of how close together two things can be before they are seen as one.
 light microscopes allow a resolution of about . micrometres whereas electron microscopes can resolutions below  nanometer.
 electron beams from a cathode are focused by magnetic lenses on to the specimen. they are then magnified by a series of magnetic lenses until they hit photographic plate or light sensitive sensors  which transfer the image to a computer screen. the image produced is called an electron micrograph em.
 the transmission electron microscope tem produces d images for example of biological while the scanning electron microscope sem produces d images or models.
 as its name implies the tem image is produced by detecting electrons that are transmitted through the sample.
 by contrast the sem usually monitors secondary electrons which are emitted from the surface due to excitation by the primary electron beam.
 generally the tem resolution is about an order of magnitude better than the sem resolution however because the sem image relies on surface processes rather than transmission it is able to image thicker samples and gives better d contrast.
 samples viewed under an electron microscope have to be treated in many ways:
 fixation  is preserving the sample to make it more realistic. glutaraldehyde  for hardening  and osmic acid  which stains lipids black  are used.
 dehydration  is the removing of water to be replaced with an embedding medium such as ethanol or propanone.
 embedding  supports the tissue for sectioning in a resin such as araldite.
 sectioning  produces thin slices for mounting. these can be cut on an ultramicrotome with a diamond knife to produce very thin slices.
 staining  uses metals such as lead and uranium to reflect electrons to give contrast between different structures.
 the samples have to be viewed in vacuums as air would scatter the electrons. this means that no living material can be studied.
 the samples have to be prepared in many ways to give proper detail resulting in artifacts  objects purely the result of treatment and this gives the problem of distinguishing artifacts from material. electron microscopes are also very expensive to buy and maintain.

13	orz also seen as otl or orz otz oz sto jto no is a japanese emoticon representing a kneeling or bowing person with the o being the head the r being the arms and part of the body and the z being part of the body and the legs. this stick figure represents failure and despair. it is also commonly mis-used for representing a great admiration for sometimes with an overtone of sarcasm someone else's view or action. it was first seen in late . it was first used at the forum on techside japanese personal website. at the techside faq forum techsidebbsbbs  a poster asked about a cable cover typing to show a cable and its cover. others commented that it looked like a kneeling person and the symbol became popular. these comments were soon deleted as they were considered off-topic. however one of the first corresponding reactions can be found on the thread on chitchat forum techside on december   and spawned a subculture in late . cite about orz orz is associated sometimes with the phrase nice guy mdash that is the concept of males being rejected for a date by girls they are pursuing with a phrase like youre a nice guy or id like to be your friend. though people generally use the pictograph to show that they have failed they are in despair some users use it to imply being doubled over in laughter. it is not to be read phonetically the letters are spelled out. orz should not be confused with mnbspm which means an apology. another common posture emoticon is ogc which depicts a man in the process of masturbation. the emoticon is used to express appreciation or sarcasm toward a sexual topic or image it became widely used after awareness was raised by a subsequently revised logo for the office of government commerce.cite unveils new logo to red

13	first english civil war image:english civil war map  to of territory held by royalists red and parliamentarians green   . :main article first english civil war. the long parliament having controverted the king's authority raised an army led by robert devereux rd earl of essex with the intention of defending parliament against the king and his supporters. charles i in the meantime had left london and also raised an army using the archaic system of a commission of array. he raised the royal standard at nottingham in august. in september  king charles i raised his standard in the market square of wellington a small though highly influential market-town in the english midland county of shropshire and addressed his troops the next day at nearby orleton hall. he declared that he would uphold the protestant religion the laws of england and the liberty of parliament. at the outset of the conflict much of the country remained neutral though the royal navy and most english cities favoured parliament while the king found considerable support in rural communities. historians estimate that between them both sides had only about  men. however the war quickly spread and eventually involved every level of society throughout the british isles. many areas attempted to remain neutral some formed bands of clubmen to protect their localities against the worst excesses of the armies of both sides but most found it impossible to withstand both the king and parliament. on one side the king and his supporters thought that they fought for traditional government in church and state. on the other most supporters of the parliamentary cause initially took up arms to defend what they thought was the traditional balance of government in church and state which had been undermined by the bad advice the king had received from his advisers before and during the eleven years tyranny. the views of the members of parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the king ndash at one point during the first civil war there were more members of the commons and lords in the king's oxford parliament parliament than there were at palace of ndash through to radicals who wanted major reforms in favour of independence and the redistribution of power at the national level. the parliamentary faction which remained in westminster did however have more resources at its disposal due to its possession of all major cities including the large arsenals at kingston upon and london. for his part charles hoped that quick victories would negate parliament's advantage in materiel. this precipitated the first major siege the siege of hull siege of hull in july  which provided a decisive victory for parliament. the first pitched battle at battle of proved inconclusive but both the royalist and parliamentarian sides claimed it as a victory. one of the king's outstanding officers his nephew prince rupert of the rupert of the palatinate proved himself a dashing cavalry commander. a parliamentarian cavalry troop raised by a country gentleman evangelical puritan and member of parliament named oliver cromwell also played a minor part in the battle. cromwell would later devise the new model army system still evident in military organisation today. the new model featured a unified command structure and professionalism which would swing the military advantage firmly towards parliament. the second field action of the war the stand-off at turnham green battle saw charles forced to withdraw to oxford. this city would serve as his base for the remainder of the war. in  the royalist forces won at battle of adwalton moor and gained control of most of yorkshire. in the midlands a parliamentary force under sir john gell 1st baronet besieged and captured the cathedral city of lichfield after the death of the original commander lord brooke and subsequently joined forces with sir john brereton to fight the inconclusive battle of hopton heath where the royalist commander the earl of northampton was killed. subsequent battles in the west of england at battle of and at battle of roundway down also went to the royalists. prince rupert could then take bristol. in the same year oliver cromwell formed his troop of ironside a disciplined unit that demonstrated his military leadership ability. with their assistance he won a victory at the battle of gainsborough in july. in general the early part of the war went well for the royalists. the turning point came in the late summer and early autumn of  when the earl of essex's army forced the king to raise the siege of gloucester and then brushed the royalist army aside at the first battle of newbury  september  in order to return triumphantly to london. other parliamentarian forces won the battle of winceby giving them control of lincoln political manoeuvring on both sides now led charles to negotiate a ceasefire in ireland freeing up english troops to fight on the royalist side while parliament offered concessions to the scots in return for aid and assistance. with the help of the scots parliament won at battle of marston moor in  gaining york and the north of england. cromwell's conduct in this battle proved decisive and demonstrated his potential as a political or military leader. the defeat at the battle of lostwithiel in cornwall however marked a serious reverse for parliament in the south west of england. subsequent fighting around second battle of though tactically indecisive strategically gave another check to parliament. in  parliament reaffirmed its determination to fight the war to a finish. it passed the self-denying ordinance by which all members of either house of parliament laid down their commands and reorganized its main forces into the new model army army under the command of sir thomas fairfax rd baron fairfax of fairfax with cromwell as his second-in-command and lieutenant of horse. in two decisive engagements  the battles of battle of on june  and of battle of on july   charles's armies were effectively destroyed. in the remains of his english realm charles attempted to recover stability by consolidating the midlands. he began to form an axis between oxford and newark on trent in nottinghamshire. those towns had become fortresses and showed more reliable loyalty to him than to others. he took leicester which lies between them but found his resources exhausted. having little opportunity to replenish them on may  he sought shelter with a scottish army at southwell in nottinghamshire. this marked the end of the first english civil war. the

13	 ephesus was one one of the great cities of the greeks in asia minor. it was colonized principally from athens. it was located in modern day turkey.
 the capital of roman republic proconsular asia which was the western part of asia minor. in the time of the romans it bore the title of the first and greatest metropolis of asia. it was distinguished for the temple of artemis diana who had her chief shrine there for its library and for its theatre which was the largest in the world capable of
 holding  spectators. it was like all ancient theatres
 open to the sky. here were exhibited the fights of wild beasts
 and of men with beasts.
 ephesus is mentioned in the bible. the epistle to ephesians is a letter written by paul of to the christians at ephesus. according to one legend the mary the mother of mary settled in ephesus after the crucifixion. there is also a letter written by ignatius of antioch to the ephesians.
 a part of the site of this once famous city is now occupied by a small turkish village ayasaluk of which name is regarded as a corruption of the two greek words hagios theologos i.e. the holy divine.
 it is a vast site not yet completely excavated but what is visible gives some idea of its original splendour and the names associated with it are evocative of its former life. the amphitheatre is huge and in a very outstanding position which dominates the view down harbour street leading to the harbour long since silted up. the library in its part of the city is still a very large structure built by a roman in memory of his father celsus. that building faces east so that the reading rooms could make best use of the morning light.
 it is unfortunate that the temple of artemis one of the seven wonders of the ancient world  is represented only by one inconspicuous column.
 a house about kms from selcuk which lies just outside ephesus is said to have been the last home of the virgin mary and is a place of pilgrimage. the structure dates back to the 7th century and presumably is built on the site of the house where she lived.

13	 the epistle to the colossians is a book of the bible new testament. it is a letter from paul of to the people of colossae.
 it was written by paul at rome during his first imprisonment there acts :  probably in the spring of ad  or as some think  and soon after he had written his epistle to ephesians.
 like some of his other epistles e.g. those to corinth this seems to have been written in consequence of information which had somehow been conveyed to him of the internal state of the church there :-. its object was to counteract teaching. a large part of it is directed against certain speculatists who attempted to combine the doctrines of oriental mysticism and asceticism with christianity thereby promising the disciples the enjoyment of a higher spiritual life and a deeper insight into the world of spirits. paul argues against such teaching showing that in christ jesus they had all things. he sets forth the majesty of his redemption. the mention of the new moon and sabbath days : shows also that there were here judaizing teachers who sought to draw away the disciples from the simplicity of the gospel.
 like most of paul's epistles this consists of two parts a doctrinal and a practical.
 the doctrinal part comprises the first two chapters. his main theme is developed in chapter . he warns them against being drawn away from him in whom dwelt all the fulness of the godhead and who was the head of all spiritual powers. christ was the head of the body of which they were members and if they were truly united to him what needed they more?
 the practical part of the epistle  enforces various duties naturally flowing from the doctrines expounded. they are exhorted to mind things that are above : to mortify every evil principle of their nature and to put on the new man :-. many special duties of the christian life are also insisted upon as the fitting evidence of the christian character.
 tychicus was the bearer of the letter as he was also of that to the ephesians and to philemon and he would tell them of the state of the apostle :-. after friendly greetings  he bids them interchange this letter with that he had sent to the neighbouring church of laodicea. the apocryphal epistle to the laodiceans is almost universally believed to be a forgery based on this instruction. he then closes this brief but striking epistle with his usual autograph salutation. there is a remarkable resemblance between this epistle and that to the ephesians.
 according to raymond brown an introduction to the new testament new york: doubleday  p.  at the present moment about  percent of critical scholarship holds that paul did not write the letter. the disagreements concern language style and the presence or absence of characteristic pauline concepts however the differences between these elements in this letter and one commonly considered the genuine work of paul e.g.  thessalonians cannot also be explained by human variability.

 nicholas whyte's commentary on colossians
 de:brief des paulus an die kolosser

13	 the epistle to galatians is a book of the bible new testament. it is a letter from paul of to the christians of galatia.
 the churches of galatia were founded by paul himself acts : gal. : : . they seem to have been composed mainly of converts from paganism : but partly also of jewish converts who probably under the influence of jewish teachers sought to incorporate the rites of judaism with christianity and by their active zeal had succeeded in inducing the majority of the churches to adopt their views : :. this epistle was written for the purpose of counteracting this judaizing tendency and of recalling the galatians to the simplicity of the gospel and at the same time also of vindicating paul's claim to be a divinely-commissioned apostle.
 the epistle was probably written very soon after paul's second visit to galatia acts :. the references of the epistle appear to agree with this conclusion. the visit to jerusalem mentioned in gal. : was identical with that of acts  and it is spoken of as a thing of the past and consequently the epistle was written subsequently to the council of jerusalem. the similarity between this epistle and that to the romans has led to the conclusion that they were both written at the same time namely in the winter of ad  during paul's stay in corinth acts : . this to the galatians is written on the urgency of the occasion tidings having reached him of the state of matters and that to the romans in a more deliberate and systematic way in exposition of the same great doctrines of the gospel.
 this epistle addresses the question was the jewish law binding on christians? the epistle is designed to prove against the jews that men are justified by faith without the works of the law of moses. after an introductory address gal. : the apostle discusses the subjects which had occasioned the epistle.  he defends his apostolic authority : :  shows the evil influence of the judaizers in destroying the very essence of the gospel  and   exhorts the galatian believers to stand fast in the faith as it is in jesus and to abound in the fruits of the spirit and in a right use of their christian freedom :  and then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed and with the benediction.
 the epistle to the galatians and that to the romans taken together form a complete proof that justification is not to be obtained meritoriously either by works of morality or by rites
 and ceremonies though of divine appointment but that it is a free gift proceeding entirely from the mercy of god to those who receive it by faith in jesus our lord.
 in the conclusion of the epistle : paul says ye see how large a letter i have written with mine own hand. it is implied that this was different from his ordinary usage which was
 simply to write the concluding salutation with his own hand indicating that the rest of the epistle was written by another hand. regarding this conclusion joseph barber in his commentary on the epistle says: at this point the apostle takes the pen from his amanuensis and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. from the time when letters began to be forged in his name  thessalonians : : it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting as a precaution against such forgeries in the present case he writes a whole paragraph summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse eager disjointed sentences. he writes it too in large bold characters gr. pelikois grammasin that his hand-writing may reflect the energy and determination of his soul.

13	 the epistle to philippians
 is a book of the bible new testament.
 it is a letter from paul of
 to the people of philippi.
 it was written by paul during the two years when he was in bonds
 in rome phil. : probably early in the year a.d.  or in
 the end of .
 the philippians had sent epaphroditus their messenger with
 contributions to meet the necessities of the apostle and on his
 return paul sent back with him this letter. with this precious
 communication epaphroditus sets out on his homeward journey.
 the joy caused by his return and the effect of this wonderful
 letter when first read in the church of philippi are hidden
 from us. and we may almost say that with this letter the church
 itself passes from our view. to-day in silent meadows quiet
 cattle browse among the ruins which mark the site of what was
 most attractive church of the apostolic age. but the name and
 fame and spiritual influence of that church will never pass. to
 myriads of men and women in every age and nation the letter
 written in a dungeon at rome and carried along the egnatian way
 by an obscure christian messenger has been a light divine and a
 cheerful guide along the most rugged paths of life professor
 the church at philippi was the first-fruits of european
 christianity. their attachment to the apostle was very fervent
 and so also was his affection for them. they alone of all the
 churches helped him by their contributions which he gratefully
 acknowledges acts :  cor. :  thess. :. the
 pecuniary liberality of the philippians comes out very
 conspicuously phil. :. this was a characteristic of the
 macedonian missions as  cor.  and  amply and beautifully
 prove. it is remarkable that the macedonian converts were as a
 class very poor  cor. : and the parallel facts their
 poverty and their open-handed support of the great missionary
 and his work are deeply harmonious. at the present day the
 missionary liberality of poor christians is in proportion
 really greater than that of the rich moules philippians
 the contents of this epistle give an interesting insight into
 the condition of the church at rome at the time it was written.
 paul's imprisonment we are informed was no hindrance to his
 preaching the gospel but rather turned out to the furtherance
 of the gospel. the gospel spread very extensively among the
 roman soldiers with whom he was in constant contact and the
 christians grew into a vast multitude. it is plain that
 christianity was at this time making rapid advancement in rome.
 the doctrinal statements of this epistle bear a close relation
 to those of the epistle to the romans. compare also phil. :
 with eph. :  where the church is presented under the idea
 of a city or commonwealth for the first time in paul's writings.
 the personal glory of christ is also set forth in almost
 parallel forms of expression in phil. : compared with eph.
 : : and col. :-. this exposition of the grace
 and wonder of his personal majesty personal self-abasement and
 personal exaltation after it found in these epistles is in
 a great measure a new development in the revelations given
 through st. paul moule. other minuter analogies in forms of
 expression and of thought are also found in these epistles of

13	the polygenism of samuel george morton and louis agassiz which presented human race classification of human as separately created species was rejected by charles darwin who argued for the monogenesis of the species and the recent african origin of modern humans. in contrast to most of darwin's supporters haeckel put forward a doctrine of evolutionary polygenism based on the ideas of the linguist august schleicher in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman urmenschen which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors. these separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man and under the influence of each main branch of languages humans had evolved  in a kind of use-inheritance  as separate species which could be subdivided into races. from this haeckel drew the implication that languages with the most potential formed human species with the most potential led by the semitic and indo-germanic groups with berber jewish greco-roman and germanic varieties to the fore. namettslcite book robert w. tragic sense of life: ernst haeckel and the struggle over evolutionary thought of chicago press  as haeckel stated:natrliche schpfungsgeschichte  p.  quoted after robert j. richards the linguistic creation of man: charles darwin august schleicher ernst haeckel and the missing link in nineteenth-century evolutionary

cosmides john tooby popularized their highly influential  book the adapted mind: psychology and the generation of culture isbn . many fields including in the three and a half centuries since william harvey proved that the purpose of the heart is to pump blood physiologists have revealed the functional organization of the body in blinding detail. their discoveries demonstrate beyond question that the structure of the body serves survival and reproduction. further there is near unanimity among biologists that this functional structure is a product of natural selection. in our century have developed powerful techniques that conclusively demonstrate that cognition too has structure. evolutionary psychologists are proposing that cognitive structure like physiological structure has been designed by natural selection to serve survival and reproduction. evolutionary psychology focuses on the evolved properties of nervous systems especially those of humans. because virtually all tissue in living organisms is functionally organized and because this organization is the product of by natural selection a major presumption of evolutionary psychology is that the brain too is functionally organized and best understood in evolutionary perspective. it is clear that the body is composed of a very large number of parts and that each part is highly specialized to perform a specific function in service of the survival and reproduction of the organism. using the body as a model for the brain it is a fair guess that the brain too is composed of one or more functional parts each of which is also specialized to facilitate the survival and reproduction of the organism. thus according to evolutionary psychology neural tissue is no different from any other tissue: it is functionally organized to serve survival and reproduction. this is the foundational assumption of evolutionary psychology. because vision smell pain and are indisputable functions of the nervous system that clearly have utility for survival and reproduction this assumption has a high degree of face validity. further these examples suggests that the brain may best be conceived not as an organ with a single function but rather as composed of a large and potentially vast number of functional parts. evolutionary biologists refer to the functional components of organisms as adaptations. evolutionary psychologists often refer to brain functions as psychological adaptations although are not qualitatively different from other adaptations. the functional organization of the body has been elucidated primarily by the direct examination of morphology. a detailed analysis of the structure and composition of our organs and tissues has resulted in an excellent understanding of their purpose. unfortunately this has not been the case with the brain. the gross morphology of the brain appears to have little connection with its functional properties. although we have a fair understanding of nerve cells--the primary constituents of neural tissue--the properties of the brain clearly come from higher order assemblages of such cells not just the cells themselves. this is just as true of organs like the heart as is of the brain. because nerve cells can rapidly change state e.g. their firing rate because such state-changes involve little energy and because they can be well insulated from their neighbors it is possible for a nerve cell to be in one state whereas some of its close neighbors may be in completely different states. this is in marked contrast to say muscle cells. if one muscle cell is involved in a contraction then nearby cells almost certainly are as well. neural tissue is quite different. even the individual states of nerve cells in a network depend critically on the topology of the network itself. further assemblages that are actually distinct may have a complex three-dimensional distribution that can be very difficult to untangle. these properties of neural tissue make it exceedingly difficult to see the morphology of neural assemblages--with few exceptions the network topology of virtually our entire brain is currently invisible. it exists at a scale above the individual cell but well below that which can be teased apart with any imaging technology currently available. until recent decades much of our immune system was similarly invisible. evolutionary psychology offers one way around this technological limitation. if researchers had a sound basis for proposing brain functions a priori they could then seek indirect evidence that brains in fact have these functional properties. philosophers and scientists had long wondered why living things are made up of an amazing array of beautifully designed mechanisms an organization which non-living things completely lack. why is it that entities that reproduce manifest overwhelming evidence of design but entities that don't reproduce are utterly devoid of the same? as darwin and wallace first perceived the association of reproduction and design is not accidental. evolution by natural selection is currently accepted as the only process whereby entities can acquire functional properties. functional organization is the consequence of the reproductive feedback that characterizes natural selection. if a population of reproducing entities hereafter organisms varies in some trait if the variations can be passed on to offspring and if as a consequence of possessing a particular variant an organism produces more offspring on average than organisms that lack that variant over evolutionary time then the population will come to consist solely of organisms possessing the reproductively efficacious variant trait. in this way populations of organisms will tend to acquire traits that facilitate reproduction and lose traits that hinder reproduction. we now know that what is passed on to offspring is a large dna molecule that is further partitioned into numerous sections called genes. because the structure of this dna is intimately bound up with the structure of the organism variations in the dna are strongly associated with variations in the organism. changes in dna are referred to as mutations and result from environmental hazards such as radiation toxins etc. reproduction is an enormously complex process. at any given moment in the human body there are thousands of process that should they fail to complete successfully would result in death within minutes. for this reason any given random change in the body is likely to hinder survival and reproduction not facilitate it. there are far more ways for a mechanism to fail than there are ways to improve it. how many times has a change occurred to your car so that it got much higher than the epa estimated miles-per-gallon rather than much lower? thus the vast majority of dna mutations result in changes to the body called the phenotype that hinder reproduction. occasionally however a mutation occurs that results in a change to the phenotype that facilitates reproduction. because this mutation can be passed on to offspring and because this mutation tends to result in more offspring the mutation becomes more frequent in the population. over time this process will result in organisms that have a sophisticated repertoire of mechanisms that facilitate reproduction we now have the answer to the question posed above: what functions is the brain likely to perform? if brain tissue is organized all other tissue it will perform precisely those functions that facilitate reproduction. more accurately because evolution by natural selection is an historical process and because the future cannot be predicted the brain and body will perform functions that facilitated reproduction note the past tense. whether they currently do so will depend on how closely the present resembles the past. if we can develop an accurate picture of a species reproductive ecology--the set of physical transformations that had to occur over evolutionary time for individuals to reproduce--we can infer those properties the organism is likely to have in order to ensure that those transformations reliably took place. evolutionary time the time it takes for reproductively efficacious mutations to arise and spread in the population is often taken to be roughly  generations for humans that equals about  years. over the last  years humans regularly encountered spiders and snakes creatures whose toxins would have significantly impeded the reproduction of individuals unlucky enough to get injected with them. over the last  years humans have regularly encountered automobiles encounters that also can seriously impede reproduction e.g. by getting run over. because  years is long enough for humans to evolve protective mechanisms but  years isn't we can predict that humans may well possess an innate aversion to spiders and snakes but not to automobiles--even though far more people are currently killed by cars than by spiders or snakes. once we have firmly established that avoiding spiders and snakes would have reliably facilitated the reproduction of ancestral humans we can then design experiments to determine whether humans in fact possess an innate cognitive ability to detect and avoid these animals more on how to do this below. a major lesson of is that if you want to understand the brain look deeply at the environment of ancestors as focused through lens of reproduction. if presumptions of evolutionary psychology correct the structure of our brains should closely reflect reproductive ecology. thus evolutionary psychology provides a method for perceiving the functional organization of studying the world--currently a far more tractable problem than disentangling neural assemblages. application evolutionary theory to human psychology innate cognitive however is controversial. leda john 
13	specifically ep proposes that the brain comprises a large number of functional mechanisms called psychological adaptations that evolved by natural selection to effect or faciliate the reproduction of the organism. these mechanisms are universal in the species with the exception that some will be specific to one sex or the other. uncontroversial examples of psychological adaptatations include vision hearing memory and motor control. more controversial examples include male and female mating preferences and strategies incest avoidance mechanisms and cheater detection mechanisms. 
13	it is claimed this criticism ignores the fact that most evolutionary psychological research is based on certainties about the past such as the fact that women got pregnant and men did not and that humans lived in groups. critics claim that label pseudoscience. yet evolutionary psychologists use the same methods that other psychologists use to test their theories. further functional hypotheses for other evolved body functions are routinely tested and falsified. mates. yet the opposite argument could also be made: that sociologists attribute elements of the human condition to sociology that may be attributable to biology most evolutionary psychologists would argue that this is a false distinction in any case. 
13	the idea that organisms are machines that are designed to function in particular environments was eloquently argued by william paley who in turn drew upon the work of many others. this idea is the foundation of modern medicine and biology. prior to darwin and wallace it was thought that the design evident in organisms was evidence for god. darwin and wallace's theory of evolution by natural selection provided a scientific account of the origins of function. just like hearts lungs livers kidneys and immune systems cognition has functional evolved by natural selection and therefore has a genetic basis. like other organs and tissues this functional structure should should solve important problems survival reproduction. understanding evolved functions serve. 
13	many alternative hypothesis and lack of predictability critics say that too many valid hypotheses including contradictory ones can be drawn from the same evolutionary principles. they predict many or all possible behaviours including contradictory ones. therefore many human behaviours will fit some hypotheses by pure chance. central paradigm of evolutionary psychology is impossible to prove and predicting power of evolutionary psychology is trivial. an example: human which is egoistic fits selfish gene hypothesis. if is altruistic this fits kin selection or reciprocal altruism. if is altruistic towards complete stranger this fits handicap princliple. every possible behavior of that human would fit some hypothesis and contradict another. it is hard to predict how a human will act is a situation and if central paradigm of evolutionary psychology is true. critics say that most explanations of evlutionary psychology are trivial like men will like beautiful women. more complex explanations run into conflict of contradictory hypothesis. therefore practical usefulness of evolutionary psychology is doubtful. 
13	the relevant proximate mechanisms that mediate this cooperation discrimination of genetic relatedness vs. circumstantial cues that have correlated with relatedness in ancestral environments are debated and sometimes misunderstood. here is one recent example of attempted clarification from west et al. : his original papers on inclusive fitness theory hamilton pointed out a sufficiently high relatedness to favour altruistic behaviours could accrue in two ways  kin discrimination or limited dispersal  hamilton   . is a huge theoretical literature on the possible role of limited dispersal reviewed by platt  bever  and west et al. a as well as experimental evolution tests of these models diggle et al.  griffin et al.  kmmerli et al.  . however despite this it is still sometimes claimed that kin selection requires kin discrimination oates  wilson  silk  . furthermore a large number of authors appear to have implicitly or explicitly assumed that kin discrimination is the only mechanism by which altruistic behaviours can directed towards relatives there is a huge industry papers reinventing limited dispersal as an explanation for cooperation. the mistakes in these areas seem to stem from the incorrect assumption that kin selection or indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination misconception  despite the fact that hamilton pointed out the potential role of limited dispersal in his earliest papers inclusive fitness theory hamilton  hamilton  hamilton  hamilton . west et al.  p. and supplement namewwest et al. . sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans. evolution and social behaviour    to the extent that cues based on co-residence and familiarity play the major role in mediating social ties and cooperation as they do social mammals  it may not be necessary to invoke active discrimination of relatedness as the main proximate mechanism. hamilton himself had this to say on the point: do not expect anything describable as an innate kin recognition adaptation used for social behaviour other than mating hamilton   namehhamilton w.d.  discriminating nepotism: expectable common and overlooked. in kin recognition in animals edited by d. j. c. fletcher and c. d. michener. new york: wiley. following this line of argument a holland maximilian social bonding and nurture kinship: compatibility between cultural and biological approaches london school of economics phd thesis  has been made between inclusive fitness theory psychological attachment theory and cultural anthropology's findings on human kinship patterns which resolves the apparent lack of compatibility between the biological and cultural perspectives on human social behaviour. in this view human bonding and social cooperation in many societies often continues to correlate with genetic relatedness due to the fact that in most societies circumstances usually place genetic relatives in close proximity from the earliest developmental stages. but the key proximate mechanisms  familiarity nurture bonding and cooperation  are non deterministic in relation to genetic relatedness in particular symbolic historical economic or other circumstances certain societies may display patterns of social kinship that do not necessarily closely coincide with genetic relatedness. inclusive fitness theory is compatible with both patterns. 
13	 some flaws discovered on proposed mating systems at sexual selection  some modern evolutionary biologists believe the idea of selective females and promiscuous males is incorrect for such a large percentage of species that it should no longer be considered a valid principle. olivia judson : argues that the formulation of bateman's principle was limited by such things as short observation time in his experiments. tim birkhead  has also documented extensive examples of exceptions to sexual selection with a focus on sperm competition. that is reproductive success is positively and significantly correlated with number of mates in both males and females though the trend as predicted is greater in males because they can't be pregnant. both sexes benefit from mating with multiple partners though males can't be pregnant so they are capable of more so. batemans principle implies that females are choosy because there is little advantage for her to mate with multiple males. observation of many species from rabbits to flies has shown that females have more offspring if they mate with a larger number of males. this seemingly contradicts bateman's theory specifically his conclusion that while males had more children the more partners they mated with females did not exceptions to bateman's principle abound as do hypotheses explaining the evolution of female promiscuity. females in fact have a lot to gain depending on the species: some combinations of male and females genomes are incompatible causing abortion or reduced offspring viability. mating with multiple males can increase likelihood of finding a compatible partner. for example in the pseudoscorpion cordylochernes scorpioides females that mate once with two mates tend to have more offspring surviving to adulthood than females that mate twice with one mate. this is presumably because the female is putting her proverbial eggs in multiple baskets reduced risk of inbreeding incompatibility and low offspring fitness is common in inbred populations where genetic diversity is low. splendid fairy-wrens malarus splendis are relatively sedentary and have a low dispersal rate. though the species is socially monogamous mating within the social group would lead to a highly inbred population. females sneak copulations with males outside the group resulting in more successful genetically diverse offspring male chimpanzees lions and many other mammals will kill unrelated offspring in order to bring the female into estrus providing a mating opportunity for the male. by mating with multiple males a female can confuse the paternity of her offspring and males are less likely to commit infanticide if they may have sired the offspring in some species like the shiner perch cymatogaster aggregata copulation and fertilization are separated by several months. if the female mated once and the males sperm was unviable she would have to wait until the next breeding cycle to mate again. instead the promiscuous female mates with multiple males to ensure that her eggs will be successfully fertilized bateman bases his hypotheses on the assumption that males are promiscuous as results in sexual selection because their gametes are inexpensive and unlimited. however the male reproductive expense can be great and often this results in males choosing mates carefully. several hypotheses explain the evolution of these behaviors. copulation can be demanding females of many species require multiple copulations in order to stimulate ovulation or to produce hormones to initiate pregnancy. this requires a high energy investment on the part of the males. lionesses for example may require the stimulation from over  copulations to produce a single litter of cubs. this adaptation may ensure the strength and fitness of the lioness mate which would result in higher quality offspring sarah hrdy an american anthropologist and primatologist who has made several major contributions to evolutionary psychology and sociobiology asserts that chimpanzees bonobos and langur monkeys and probably humans are exceptions to sexual selection. in her book: langurs of abu she discovered that infanticide was independent of overcrowding  it was possibly an evolutionary tactic: when an outside male takes over a group he usually proceeds to kill all infants. this postulated tactic would be very advantageous to the male langurs who practiced infanticide. turnover in a langur tribe occurs approximately every  months. the male who is taking over has a very small window of opportunity to pass on his genes and if the females are already nursing infants it's likely that they won't ovulate again for another year. killing their dependent infants makes the females once again receptive to mating. female choice is subverted as females are put under pressure to ovulate and are forced to breed with the infanticidal males. this is where the idea of sexual counter-strategies comes into play. hrdy theorized that by mating with as many males as possible particularly outside males who are not part of the colony mothers are able to successfully protect their young as males were unlikely to kill an infant if there was the slightest chance that it might be their own. today her results and conclusions are widely received. even trivers who once dismissed her apparently illogical convictions admits that her theory regarding female sexual strategies has worn well.

13	existentialism in the post-nachkriegsliteratur return of existentialism although existentialism is still a movement with many followers it no longer attracts the prestige it once had. there have been many critics of existentialism one famous example is the philosopher adorno who attacked existentialists in this case heidegger on the grounds that they misuse language. nevertheless existentialism still exerts a strong influence on philosopy and art. one will find many existential themes in post-modern thought one is reminded of derrida's work on death and it also exerts a strong influence in popular culture. hollywood films such as dead poet's society american beauty and the united states of leland all make reference to various existential themes. in literature books such as toilet: the novel by michael szymczyk  have attracted attention in the united states as being a return of existentialism. excrement literature as it is so-called uses the symbol of excrement to evoke the existential themes of loneliness and death. popular in russia in the late 90s, it has come in vogue in the states popularized by toilet: the novel which relates the exploits of the two generations of toilet people that still retain the smell of excrement exploring the alienation from society that ensues. the 
13	one should however not confuse post-modernism with existentialism. films with post-modern themes mimic the idea of a simulacrum which has to do with reality and appearence and how the latter makes the former indistinguishable if it can sufficentily mimic it the matrix film even going so far to make this point clear as to include a copy of baudrillard's simulacra and simulation in the background of the protagonist's apartment. existential films on the other hand deal more with the themes of: retaining authenticity in a mechanical apathetic world something post modernism would stauntly reject as authenticity relates to a reality that does not exist.  the consciousness of death heideggers being towards death exemplified in the swedish film the seventh seal.  the feelings of alienation and loneliness that come about from being unique in a world of many or to use nietzsche's phrase herd-animals  the concept which heidegger explicated in sein und zeit being and time of alltagliche selbstsein everydayness. however a great deal of cultural activity in art film and literature since  contains both post-modern and existential elements which ironically would support the post-modern thesis of borderlessness between concepts. books and films such as palahunik toilet: novel szymczyk blade runner scott the neverending story ende distort the line between reality and appearence but at the same time espouse strong existential themes. in the film industry post-modern techniques of editing to show the displacement discontinuity and perspectiveness of time that is typical of post-modernism can go hand-in-hand with a purely existential story thus serving as a synthesis between the two in terms of technique and function. moreover this has served to brand a new term neo-existentialism that combines both the epistemological elements of post-modern thought with the reflective ontological beliefs of existentialism. the annual meeting of the commitee for existentialism in  which brings together some of the top philosophers thinkers and writers from around the world to discuss the current state of existentialism declared that in  existentialism had evolved into what the philosopher michael szymczyk called neo existentialism. the commitee published a paper of its annual conference that stated that post-modernism in no way hindered or conflicted with existentialism. in fact they said books such as fight club toilet: the novel which combined dreary and confused sense of time and identity along a consciousness of individuality and death served to promote existentialism in that it taught people to question think and above all live extraordinaraly. but they said the avant garde in should never replace such impeccable gems like crime and punishment or the film dead poet's society that never stray afar from the dictum carpe diem. after all as committee's paper said in conclusion  if one thinks too much one may find that when all is said and done one has lived too little. as for the future state of existentialism it is sure that so long as there are men that live there will be men that die and so long as there is that there will be existentialism for those who think ponder and become nauseated over that unfortunate if not liberating fact. 
13	freedom.  another view is simply that existentialists are insane which many existentialists would reply is correct but they would retort only if you considered a lack of desire live the traditional office life as reducible to insanity.  and the most famous criticism of existentialism is by adorno who in the fashion of schopenhauer's critique of hegel regarded existentialism as inane mostly in regards to heidegger's usage of language. however there are thinkers as camus who write rather simplistically and without artifice and whose terms nothingness are linguistically justified by simple glance to the past the future. 
13	god sartre unlike kierkegaard denies the existence of god. sartre argues that without god there is no higher power to define man. however there are versions of existentialism that are religious. theological existentialism as advocated by philosophers and theologians like paul tillich gabriel marcel and martin buber posits god's existence as well as accepting many tenets of atheistic existentialism. belief in god is a personal choice made on the basis of a passion of faith an observation or experience. just as atheistic existentialists can freely choose not to believe theistic existentialists can freely choose to believe in god and could despite one's doubt have faith that god exists and that god is good. a third type of existentialism is agnostic. again it is a matter of choice to be agnostic. the agnostic existentialist makes no claim to know or not know if there is a greater picture in play rather simply recognizes that the greatest truth is that which he chooses to act upon. the agnostic existentialist feels that to know the greater picture whether there is one or not is impossible for human minds--or if it is not impossible that at least has not found it yet. like christian existentialists the agnostic believes existence is subjective. however one feels about the issue the act of finding knowledge of the existence of god often has little value because feels it to be impossible and believes it is useless.

13	symbolism but more important the initial ritual also depicts the passing of the secret knowledge through the ages from mouth to mouth as symbolized by the participants passing the kiss of knowing along in the circle and then later to individual members. interesting to note is also that the priest always moves counter-clockwise inside the circle of women exactly as the sun astronomically moves counter clock-wise through the zodiac from one age a sign in the zodiac to another. thus freemason or evident is a strong emphasis in the movie on solar freemason symbolism spread throughout the movie found in minor details such as on doors and walls etc. 
13	most telling scenes of the movie show the protagonist penetrating the religious celebrations of a secret society comprised of an occult ritual preceding a sexual orgy. in the ritual twelve women wearing black robes kneel in a circle around a priest in a red robe who during the entire ritual will continously incantate a certain invocation. the priest is holding a censer in his right hand and a golden staff in his left. during the entire ritual the priest moves counterclock-wise through the circle. the most notable element of the ritual as portrayed in the movie is when a kiss is passed from one woman to another along the circle due to the mask worn in the ritual the kiss is only mimed. the movie does not show the number of times the kiss is passed from woman to woman and therefore it is unknown whether the kiss is intended to be passed along the entire circle or only a specific number of times. at the end of the ritual the priest releases one woman after another from the circle into the audience where she selects one member of that audience and mimes a kiss with that person. after the ritual a sexual takes place among members of the orders. it is possible that part of the ritual is also in preparation of the orgy introducing the element the expectation that certain gods or godlike entities take possession of participants in the rituals allowing sexual intercourse between members of the order and those astral entities. the ritual itself can be interpreted as follows: each of the women embodies a sign of the zodiac which in turn designates an age. in astrotheology and astrology these ages are defined by the twelve constellations the sun is found at sunrise. at the moment of this writing the sun rises in the zodiacal constellation of pisces is on verge crossing over into constellation of aquarius. this gradual change of the sun's location in the zodiacal constellations at sunrise is due to the precession of the equinoxes a circular movement of the rotational axis of our planet. the sun enters into a new zodiacal constellation roughly every  years. it can be assumed that the women in the circle each represent such an age equivalent to a span of about  years. the kiss that is passed from woman to woman represents that is preserved and passed over the ages. the priest can be assumed to represent the sun it passes through the constellations of the zodiac as during the entire ritual he moves in counter clock direction through the circle just as the sun moves in counter-clock direction through the constellations of the zodiac. at the end of the ritual the symbolism of preserving and passing on the secret knowledge to a chosen few of the order is reinforced fact that women after being released from the circle through the authority of the priest find a member in the attending audience and mime a with an member. apart from the ritual itself the entire movie is replete with the symbolism not only of freemasonry but of other secret societies. most notable is the solar symbolism found in the scenes of the protagonists visit to the mansion where the ritual and celebrations are held but also during other scenes the movie. this symbolism can be found on ornaments on and over doors and walls or for example on the pillars and statues which are placed to the right and left of the doorways of the mansion. rich in masonic symbolism is also the home of the woman protagonist visits with to console her immediately after death of a close relative. notable are aside masonic alcove hallway also seemingly the red benches with white spots in the hallway a pattern which is for example associated by sibirian shamans with the fly agaric amanita muscaria mushroom containing psylocybin a highly psychoactive psychodelic substance. 
13	 altogether added to the plot are the person of victor ziegler and the mandy episode and consequently also the ambiguous conversation between ziegler and bill in which the former claims that he participated in the orgy and that the threat during the orgy was only staged to scare bill off. this also gives bill's visit to the morgue a different slant. in fact the body in the morge is not mandy's but the actress's who had warned and subsequently redeemed bill during the orgy scene.

13	ten robustus euryapteryx and didinus.br it has been long suspected that the species of moa described as euryapteryx exilis e. e. crassus and pachyornis mappini constituted males and females respectively. this has been confirmed by analysis of dna extracted from bone material for sex-specific genetic markers nature  p.. more interestingly the former three species of dinornis d. struthioides d. novaezealandiae and d. struthioides have turned out to be males struthioides and females of only two species one each formerly occurring on new zealands north d. novaezealandiae and south d. robustus island in addition to the nature paper cited above also nature  p. . moa females were larger than males up to  of their size and  of their weight. this phenomenon reverse size dimorphism not uncommon amongst ratites being most pronounced in kiwis.br on a side note the plural form of moa is also moa as maori words do not feature plural-s.

13	 ulietensis. a completely mysterious bird now only known from a photograph and some descriptions of a now lost specimen. its position is unresolvable although for reasons and because of the surviving material it possibly was a honeyeater. the rodrigues starling variously described as fregilupus rodericanus necropsar rodericanus testudophaga bicolor or necropsar leguati was finally identified as a misidentified partially specimen of the martinique trembler cinclocerthia ruficauda gutturalis fleischer et al. poster presentation  at naoc . 
13	nonsense.  no its not complete nonsene. sure not all ira men would have taken a stand but some would have. balaclavas?  so because some members of the ira did wrong all of them do? by the same logic i can prove you would shoot an innocent civilian because at least some paras did on ... themselves?  this question is kinda rhetoric because thats not the way it happened. even if the soldiers took fire they didnt respond to the attackers but attacked civilians in at least a few of cases.
