54	remember that the permutation formulas only calculate the number of needed ways or combinations in cases for which only the order matters and not the components. the following formula looks like this: :ltmathgtnchoose r r r  n!over where n is the total number of components and ltmathgtr r are the numbers of repetitions of each of the components in your data. as a practical example of this we may want to see in how many ways can we rearrange the following row of letters: a a b b c. first of all we have to write out all the repetitions: where ltmathgtr r are the number of repetitions of a's b's and a c respectively. the total number of letters is  so our n  . applying the formula we get the following: ltmathgtnchoose r r r  !over !!!  over   the total number of ways in which we can rearrange the given row of letters is  ways. due to the large number of arrangements it would be quite hard to write out the arrangements by hand as it was done in the example above.

54	death of the universe arrow of  since a finite universe is an isolated system the second law of thermodynamics states that its total entropy is constantly increasing. it has been speculated since the 19th century that the universe is fated to a heat death of the death in which all the energy ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source. if the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy thenas sir roger penrose has pointed outgravity plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars which collapse eventually into black holes. black hole entropy of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the black hole's event horizon.cite new language of university and rev. j e tension hydrophobicity and black holes: the entropic rev e stat phys plasmas fluids relat interdiscip jacob bekenstein and stephen hawking have shown that black holes have the maximum possible entropy of any object of equal size. this makes them likely end points of all entropy-increasing processes if they are totally effective matter and energy traps. hawking has however recently changed his stance on this the role of entropy in cosmology remains a controversial subject. recent work has cast some doubt on the heat death hypothesis and the applicability of any simple thermodynamic model to the universe in general. although entropy does increase in the model of an expanding universe the maximum possible entropy rises much more rapidly moving the universe further from the heat death with time not closer. this results in an entropy gap pushing the system further away from the posited heat death equilibrium.cite the failed other complicating factors such as the energy density of the vacuum and macroscopic quantum effects are difficult to reconcile with thermodynamical models making any predictions of large-scale thermodynamics extremely difficult.cite gal physics and  the entropy gap is widely believed to have been originally opened up by inflation early rapid exponential expansion of the universe.
