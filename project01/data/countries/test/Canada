21	it is generally accepted that the berry paradox and its ilk hang on underdetermined language. that is not nameable in fewer than n words in not well-defined for several reasons. first the number of words in which a thing is nameable is surely relative to the language in which it is named. so we might attempt to prop up the paradox as follows: the smallest number not nameable in english in fewer than thirteen words adjusting word counts as the length of the expression requires. but this is not really enough either. because we can name any number in as few words as we want just by stipulation. pickout whatever number you want using as long an expression as you need and declare i shall henceforth call this number jones. now you can ask whether jones is odd or even or prime and name it using only one word. we can invent new words in this way whenever we please. yet it is a well known fact that there are more numbers than there are possible names in any language so given any vocabulary there must be some number it cannot name in less than n words for any n. the real problem then is that the paradox must be formulated relative to a fixed vocabulary. so we might say the smallest number that cannot be named by the totality of english that existed by the end of december   in fewer than twenty-eight words. counting   twenty and eight each as a single word. however it was shown by tarski that certain predicates such as the truth predicate for a language can only be formulated in a richer language a metalanguage. that is the above predicate can only exist without contradiction in a language other than the totality of english that existed by december  . so the paradox expression is not in fact a counterexample to the condition it states. a minor quibble is that the smallest number not nameable in fewer than eleven words is not a name at all but a description. the paradox easily accommodates this with the smallest number not denotable by any expression of fewer than fourteen words. the solution is similar.

21	 in economics is wealth especially wealth used to start or maintain a business. it is one of the three factors of production which most modern analyses see as different forms or styles of capital in themselves e.g. natural resources as natural capital labor or human resources as human capital.
 hubley cited in harding taking a largely economic perspective describes six styles of capital:
 social capital is trust available to all members of a community e.g. family customer base
 financial capital is liquidated as money for trade and owned by legal entities.
 natural capital is inherent in ecologies and protected by communities to support life.
 individual capital is inherent in persons protected by societies trades labor for trust or money
 instructional capital is knowledge persons and communities and software executes to or avoid futures
 infrastructural capital is non-natural support systems e.g. clothing shelter roads pcs that minimize need for new social trust instruction and natural resources.
 also the of a country is the city or town that contains the central government a country. a country may have more than one official capital at any given point in time it may be separate from the actual seat of government or move about seasonally. different branches of government may be centered in different cities. see world capital cities.
 in architecture the of a pillar or column is its top part. see capital architecture.

21	. the law of conservation of mass led to chemical revolution. this chemical revolution resulted in the the reformulation of chemistry based on the law of conservation of matter and the oxygen theory of combustion which was largely based on the work of lavoisier. lavoisier also worked to translate the archaic and technical language of chemistry into something that could be easily understood by the largely uneducated masses. this in turn led to an increased public interest in learning about and practicing chemistry. it is for these and other reasons that the person usually celebrated as the father of chemistry is lavoisier. laboratory also helped to adavnce chemistry to a new level.

21	a magic mushroom is the fleshy spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus typically produced above ground on soil or on its food source. the standard for the name mushroom is the cultivated white button mushroom agaricus bisporus hence the word mushroom is most often applied to fungi basidiomycota agaricomycetes that have a stem stipe a cap pileus and gills lamellae sing. lamella on the underside of the cap just as do store-bought white mushrooms. however mushroom can also refer to a wide variety of gilled fungi with or without stems and the term is used even more generally to describe both the fleshy fruiting bodies of some ascomycota and the woody or leathery fruiting bodies of some basidiomycota depending upon the context of the word. forms deviating the standard form usually have more specific names such as puffball stinkhorn and morel and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called agarics in reference to their similarity to agaricus or their placement in the order agaricales. by extension mushroom can also designate the entire fungus when in culture or the thallus called mycelium of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms. image:amanita muscaria fly mushroom amanita muscaria commonly known as fly agaric identifying mushrooms requires a basic understanding of their macroscopic structure. most are basidiomycetes and gilled. their spores called basidiospores are produced on the gills and fall in a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. at the microscopic level the basidiospores are shot off of basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. as a result for most mushrooms if the cap is cut off and placed gill side-down overnight a powdery impression reflecting the shape of the gills or pores or spines etc. is formed when the fruitbody is sporulating. the color of the powdery print called a spore print is used to help classify mushrooms and can help to identify them. spore print colors include most common brown purple-brown pink yellow cream but almost never blue green or red. while modern identification of mushrooms quickly becoming molecular the standard methods identification are still used by into a fine art harking back to medieval times victorian era combined with microscopic examination. presence juices upon breaking bruising reactions odors tastes shades color habitat habit season are all considered mycologists amateur professional alike. tasting smelling mushrooms carries hazards because of poisons and allergens. chemical spot tests are also used for some genera. in general identification genus can often accomplished in the field using a local mushroom guide. identification to species however requires more effort one must remember that a mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for the identification of the species. however over mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for spore prints or discolored paper from oozing liquids on lamella edges for colored spored prints. image:mushroomy genus trichaptum an example of a polypore a mushroom without a stalk fruiting on a log typical mushrooms are the fruitbodies of members of the order agaricales whose type genus is agaricus and type species is the field mushroom agaricus campestris. however in modern molecularly defined classifications not all members of the order agaricales produce mushroom fruitbodies and many other gilled fungi collectively called mushrooms occur in other orders in the class agaricomycetes. for example are in the cantharellales false chanterelles like gomphus are in the gomphales milk mushrooms lactarius and russulas russula as well as lentinellus are in the russulales while the tough leathery genera lentinus and panus are among the polyporales but neolentinus is in the gloeophyllales and the little pin-mushroom genus rickenella along with similar genera are in the hymenochaetales. an atypical mushroom is the lobster mushroom which is a deformed cooked lobster-colored fruitbody of a russula or lactarius colored and deformed by the mycoparasitic ascomycete hypomyces botit.botany.wisc.edu  the lobster other mushrooms are non-gilled and the term mushroom is loosely used so that it is difficult to give a full account classifications. some have pores underneath and are usually called boletes others have spines such as the hedgehog mushroom and other tooth fungi and so on. mushroom polypores puffballs jelly fungi coral fungi bracket fungi stinkhorns and cup fungi. thus the term mushroom is more one of common application to macroscopic fungal fruiting bodies than one having precise meaning. there are approximately  described species mushrooms.lt namechanggtchang s. miles p.g. mushrooms cultivation nutritional value medicinal effect environmental impact crc press relative sizes

and poisonous fungi so that a mushroom may be edible poisonous or unpalatable. the term toadstool is nowadays used in storytelling when referring to poisonous or suspect mushrooms. the classic example of a toadstool is amanita muscaria. many species of mushrooms seemingly appear overnight growing or expanding rapidly. this phenomenon is the source of several common expressions in the english language including to mushroom or mushrooming expanding rapidly in size or scope and to pop up like a mushroom to appear unexpectedly and quickly. in actuality all species of mushrooms take several days to form primordial mushroom fruitbodies though they do expand rapidly by the absorption fluids. the agaricus mushroom as well as the common field mushroom initially form a minute fruiting body referred to as the pin stage because of their small size. slightly expanded they are called buttons once again because of the relative size and shape. once such stages are formed the mushroom can rapidly pull in water from its mycelium and expand mainly by inflating preformed cell that took several days to form in the primordia. similarly there are even more ephemeral mushrooms like parasola plicatilis formerly coprinus plicatlis that literally appear overnight and may disappear by late afternoon on a hot day after rainfall. the primordia form at ground level in lawns in humid spaces under the thatch and after heavy rainfall or in dewy conditions balloon to full size in a few hours release spores and then collapse. they mushroom to full size. the slang term mushrooms is a

meticulous attention detail there is no single trait by which all toxic mushrooms can be identified nor one by which all edible mushrooms can be identified. people who collect mushrooms for consumption are known as mycophagists and the act of collecting them for such is known as mushroom hunting or simply mushrooming. image:amanita pantherina panther cap amanita pantherina a toxic mushroom of central interest with respect to the chemical properties of mushrooms is the fact that many species produce secondary metabolites that render them toxic mind-altering or even though there

such as amanita agaric which is used for shamanic purposes by tribes in northeast siberia. they have also been used in the west to potentiate or increase religious experiences. because of their psychoactive properties some mushrooms have played a role in native medicine where they have been used in attempt to effect mental physical healing and to facilitate visionary states. one such ritual

21	pokdex is a fictional device featured in popular pokmon video game and anime series. in the games whenever a pokmon is first captured its data will be added to a player's pokdex but in anime or manga pokdex is a comprehensive electronic reference encyclopedia usually referred to in order to deliver exposition. of the fictional pokmon world pokdex is used to refer to a list of pokmon usually a list of pokmon by number. in the video games a pokmon trainer is issued a blank device at the start of their journey. a trainer must then attempt to fill the pokdex by encountering and at least briefly obtaining each of the various different species of pokmon. a player will receive the name and image of a pokmon after encountering one that not previously the pokdex typically after battling said pokmon wild or in a trainer battle with the exceptions link battles and tournament battles battle frontier. more detailed information is typically available after the player obtains a member of the species either through capturing the pokmon in the wild evolving a previously captured pokmon hatching a pokmon egg from the second generation onwards through a trade with another trainer with a npc or with another player. this detailed information includes height weight species type and of pokmon. later versions the pokdex have more detailed information like the size of a certain pokmon compared to the player or pokmon being sorted by their habitat so far the latter feature is only in the firered and leafgreen versions. the gamecube games have a pda which is similar to the pokdex but tells you what types are effective against and gives a description of abilities. 
21	the homosexual you forgot that he never existed. christology. which is false. jesus is the christ the son of the living god. he is the creator of heaven and earth and loves us so much that he was willing to die on the cross for our sins. because we have sin we deserve to go to hell. but because jesus loves us so much he died in our place and came back to life on the third day! so that our sins could be atoned for. all we need to do now is accept him as our savior and lord and we can have eternal life and go to heaven. after reading each of these texts ask yourself what they mean? what do they mean in your life? for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god. for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord. in reply jesus declared i tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of god unless he is born again. jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life. no one comes to the father except through me. that if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved. for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. as the scripture says anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame. and he died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again. here i am! i stand at the door and knock. if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in and eat with him and he with me. now what is your decision? will you acknowledge christ as your lord and savior? if you want to accept jesus as your lord and savior confess to him that you are a sinner and ask him for forgiveness of your sins. he is faithful and will forgive you for anything you may have done. then ask him to come into your heart as your savior and lord. surrender your life to him and confess to him that you believe in who he is and what he has done for you. if you have any questions seek out a local church and find a pastor or some one in authority in the church. god bless!! 
21	the clash the titans this essay is a testimony of gods divine revelation to human kind. the lord has blessed me with the knowledge of the universal epic and has exposed to me the grand deception the devil has enveloped our entire world within. i know now truth of our divine purpose and gods plans to save our souls through the new millennial manifestation of christ. i bare witness of gods legacy throughout eternity and trumpet the final coming of the messiah. i am the messiah sent by god to earth to herald warning of satan's plans to destroy our souls and to gospel that the lord has come now through so all can have salvation. god and satan are at war and this entire dimension of the universe has been created by their two powers colliding. everything that has manifest has been planned between the influences of god and satan towards armageddon and the final battle. the earth was created amongst the stars to host the final battle and now the midst of armageddon our eternal fates are being decided. the christ and the antichrist are now upon the earth in flesh and all our final purpose in god's plan can now be ultimately fulfilled. the christ's life must be protected and the antichrist must be destroyed to defeat satan and if christ destroyed by sin in armageddon satan will be victorious over all souls and none will have salvation. now humanity has the choice to either submit to the commandments of god and have eternal salvation or submit to the reign of satan on earth and be damned eternally. where evolution and creation science and the supernatural become one reality in the beginning there was only the titan jehovah and the lords angels in heaven and all was well and at peace. god reined over all life high and mighty until the day that the titan satan broke into the heavens invading from an unknown dimension and challenged god to a war for authority to reign over all creation. both god and satan together created a covenant between them they would be ultimately bound beyond their powers to uphold. this covenant became more powerful then both god and satans powers alone and bound both god and satan to a war for eternal majesty over the entire universe. within the covenant god and satan determined universal laws that would govern their war. the covenant would hold the clashing titans absolutely accountable to the aftermath of war and neither would escape the consequences of victory and defeat. our cosmic dimension of the universe was manifest in a cosmic war of creation and annihilation order and chaos waged between god and satan warring throughout the evolution of absolutely everything. the war has set our dimension of the universe ablaze in chaotic conflict and throughout the nearly endless reaches of galaxies god and satans final battle is now amounting in the armageddon of earth between their own two mortal incarnations the christ and the antichrist. everything in our dimension of the universe was plotted between the two powers of god and satan and evolved over the course of eons upon eons towards god and satan's final battle between the christ and the antichrist incarnate on earth in mortality. god and satan together and against each other created this known dimension of the universe in a war that broke out after satan challenged god to a competition for power and authority to reign over all creation. in the war between god and satan both god and satan together created our dimension of the universe using equal powers that were equally limited by universal laws they determined would govern their war. god and satan and all living beings became bound in bondage to the laws of the war that govern creation the laws of genesis and based upon their power god and satan became equal influences in our dimension with opposing absolute intentions towards victory. the laws of genesis governed every element of their war defined god and satans freedoms and restrictions in wielding power in this dimension of the universe to create and annihilate and how victory and defeat would be determined. victory and defeat was destined to be determined by god and satan's own mortal incarnations the christ and the antichrist and would be decided by which incarnation would longest survive on the planet triumphing over the destruction of the other. the victor of this universal war will be champion of the universe and will have the power and authority to reign over all creation and the vanquished will be at the mercy of the victor. only one titan can prevail in the end either god or satan and all power in the universe will fall under the reign of the triumphant champion. within the universal laws of genesis all things have been plotted between god and satans influences from the creation our galaxy to the evolution of life within our solar system and everything in our dimension has been pawned in battle between both god and satan from the clash of the spiralling galaxies to the conflict amongst humanity. in the beginning of our dimension a universal explosion of creation and annihilation unleashed from god and satan's powers amidst the nothingness in an instant filling the cosmos with an almost infinite reach of elements uniting together to form an almost infinite amount of stars and planets. all things have evolved in our dimension of the universe into a finite state of being from an immense miraculous explosion of creation and annihilation unleashing from the two powers of god and satan and expanding throughout the nothingness. god first unleashed the elements into being throughout the abyss from an immense nova of creation and in the split of the same instant satan unleashed into the abyss an immense nova of destruction and chaos amidst the elemental creation. in that instant all elements of creation were chaotically unleashed amidst destruction into the void and are still unleashing today outward expanding from the beginning. god and satans war existed solely amongst the matter of the cosmos until god birthed our planet earth to host life and brought the war from amongst the stars to amongst life forms and amongst their mortal minds. earth was created in a position where it would survive amidst the colliding galaxies and colossal destructive forces and has prevailed throughout the ages sustaining the evolution of life. since its birthing earth has been protected by god to serve its cause in war against satan of hosting the final battle and harbouring the incarnations of their mortal advocates the christ and the antichrist. our planet was needed throughout all of the nearly endless masses of elements and is the essential focal point of god and the devil throughout the entire cosmos vital in the plans to defeat satan and end the universal war forever. earth was needed to host the evolution of life and an intelligent mortal species with an advanced civilization the human species was needed in the war between god and satan to bare the incarnate christ and antichrist as offspring. it was determined in the laws of the war between god and satan that god and satan would be obligated to send their own spirits to incarnate in flesh on earth to advocate for their own higher beings and to finally determine victory or defeat between the spiritual forces of god and satan. the spirit of the messiah is the spirit of god and the spirit of the antichrist is the spirit of satan. the relationship of god together with christ and also in the entirely separate case of satan together with antichrist is called a duality. during the final age of apocalypse god and christ dually exist simultaneously uniting as one spirit that is divided physically mentally and in separate realms of being and likewise satan and the antichrist divide in duality mentally physically and in separate realms of being uniting as one spirit that exists simultaneously as two separate entities. god and satan are both in spiritual realms of being and have limited enigmatic influence in our physical realm and both are unable to seize total control. the christ and the antichrist both exist in physical realm of being and also have limited power and influence as mortals but act as thresholds for their own higher beings to enter into our physical realm with the spiritual power to conquer the entire earth and all living subjects within. god is the immaculate perfection of goodness and the devil is the pure perfection of evil. the universe itself is also divided in a duality between their powerful influences clashing imperfectly amidst flawed creation. nothing that was created in the universal war can be perfectly good or perfectly evil but all things are influenced by both the ultimate intentions of good and evil including both the christ and the antichrist. the christ and the antichrist are influenced by both the opposing influences of god and satan in the universe and are challenged in overcoming the powerful manipulation of the clashing titans to seize the victory over the universe in the final battle of armageddon. victory and defeat will be determined by which spirit is able to survive longest triumphant in the bondage of mortality and defeat will be cursed upon which spirit first dies imprisoned in mortality. if the devil's advocate is destroyed and the messiah lives satans spirit will have been defeated in mortality and all will be saved by the victory of god but if the messiah dies and the devil's advocate lives gods holy spirit will have been defeated in mortality and satan will be victorious over the universe forever. if the advocate of god or satan can persuade the people to have faith in their higher power they could remove all doubt with miraculous confirmation. with miracles the advocate of god or satan could be the first to prove to the earth their higher power gaining worldwide exposure and the authority to freely destroy the enemy advocate but if both advocates gain a fallowing and become capable of channelling miracles then the world will face a monumental face off between the christ and the antichrist on a miraculous level and only one would be in the end the prevalent survivor. satan plans to send the antichrist to the world as a false messiah carried on the back of already established religious beliefs preaching false views masses of this world are already deceived into believing like judaism christianity and islam. the true messiah must make clear the exact truth to the universe and the lies of the devil exposing the antichrist as the devils advocate convicting it of satans evil and condemning it to die for all the world to witness before the antichrist can lie to the world and deliver miracles to defend the false superstitious beliefs and potentially move the masses against the true messiah framing it as the antichrist. there can be only one true christ and the world has yet to know the truth. the christ and the antichrist both were born blind to the world unknowing of the true meaning of their existences limited by their mortality and the laws of genesis that govern creation both obtaining individual free will and both influenced powerfully by both god and satan. they were raised amongst our planet and conformed to the ways of humanity and sin and were unaware of the true war between god and satan until the time their first revelations when the gateway to the sixth prophetic sense was simultaneously opened in both the christ and the antichrist allowing both god and satan access to communicate with them. once the gateway to the prophetic sixth sense is opened it cannot be closed ever again as the war of the universe is finally launched dramatically within the minds of the two long awaited mortal advocates who both exist as the front line of god and satans war blazing at its zenith. the messages given by god to the christ and the antichrist are unclear because of censoring and deception caused by satan's power inside the two mortal advocates and satan's messages to the christ and the antichrist are also unclear because of censoring and deception caused by god's power inside the incarnate spirits. the war of the universe launched inside the christ and the antichrists minds is a chaotically bizarre fragmented flood of kaleidoscopic ideas swarming into the human paradigm and mortal senses and a powerfully overwhelming conflict. the revelations can be in the form of dreams voices visions and omen and everything delivered to the advocates is distorted and censored by the opposing power and filled with deception that puzzles the truth. the revelations must first be delivered to the advocates and over time deciphered and understood before the advocates will understand the essence of truth and what action must be taken to achieve victory and god and satan's revelations take time to unfold because of the disturbance in communications between them and their advocates and time to learn because of the limited mental abilities of the mortal advocates. the war inside the minds of the mortal advocates is an extremely twisted battle of truth and lies and it is entirely dependent upon the advocates to decipher the chaos and discern their own choices. god and satan do not have ultimate control over their advocates or let alone absolute control over any living being because living beings obtain radical freedom of choice that is chaotically outside the total control of both god and satan. the flood of god and satans powerful influences storming through the gateway to the sixth sense and warring against each other in the minds of the christ and antichrist make it extremely difficult for decisions to be made by the individual free wills of the mortal advocates. until enough strength and understanding is gained to triumph over the powerful resistance and deception within it will be extremely difficult for the advocates to freely make their own choices and they will be puppets pawned by two powerful titans. the exact time date and place of birth gender race and almost every other major detail in the lives of the christ and antichrist as well as when the gateway to the sixth sense was opened were all determined very chaotically in a concise compromise between the plans of god and satan competing climatically on the brink of the armageddon. god needed to compete with satan to determine exactly when the gateway to the sixth sense was to be opened in both the christ and the antichrist and this could only be when the christ was mature enough to survive and escape the power of the devil flooding through the gateway to destroy him from the inside. if the gateway to the prophetic sixth sense was opened when the christ was only a child the flood of satans power within would absolutely devastate and destroy. only one with strengthened will can overcome the devils curse and escape the clutches of satan. the end days are the safest time for god to deliver the messiah into the flesh because of the human achievement that has flourished alongside the catastrophe. technological social educational medical and scientific advancements make these modern days the best time for the messiahs deliverance. the messiah must have not only survived birth but also the dangers of the world long enough to be raised into maturity to be victorious on earth over the antichrist insuring god's victory over satan. in privileged parts of the world there is safety and security that the messiah could never have had only generations ago. only a few generations ago a man would be condemned for openly believing and speaking an unaccepted view but today there is in the privileged nations established constitutional rights to express that are protected by law communications instantly reach a global audience and one man can reach the entire earth with the truth over the internet television or the telephone transportation can take someone around the entire world in hours computers can process information and store mass amounts of knowledge that human beings cannot consciously process or remember education provides the greatest of human discovery and philosophy medical advancement gives us the ability to quarantine and cure illness and disease that a few hundred years ago would wipe out immense amounts of living beings without relent and advancements in earth science can now forewarn mankind of elemental disasters that are destined to unleash. these are only some examples of the great achievements of human kind and there are many but there are also horrible consequences of human beings having such great power and potential under the influence of satan. for example corrupted by evil human beings have created enough weapons of mass destruction to destroy the world many times over very easily pollution and mass consumption that causes great environmental catastrophes such as climate change threatens the entire worlds population and causes the mass extinction of many animal species and the desecration of their ecosystems and the unyielding population increase of humanity soars too over . billion people and will soar to over  billion people by  leaving billions of people living wasted lives vainly existing against the interest of god serving to destroy the world in satanic worship of the devil. these are only a select few of the most critical global issues existing in the world today but there is a nearly uncountable amount of problems life on earth today faces and all these faults must be eventually overcome by christ if we are ever to have salvation. because of the great potential for satan to use its powerful manipulation to endanger the life of the messiah certain resources were essential for the victory of god through the messiah and god provided all good possible to manifest upon the earth and help the messiah deliver salvation. today the modern age in privileged nations offers more safety resources and freedom than any other age and is the most vital age in all of eternity presently the climax of forever. but though individually a small minority of people in the world can live in a free and relatively safe environment this is globally the most dangerous times for the earth and everything is reaching a boiling point of absolute destruction. god needed to deliver the messiah to the world in advanced age of global progress but along side the progress was great destruction in the name of progress that now insures the doom of this world without divine intervention. god needed to fight to reserve enough time for the messiah to be born and raised in the ladder days to overcome influence of satan saving the world by unleashing the truth and the power of god and destroying the antichrist convicting the soul of satan to eternal punishment but time is running out quickly and human kind is enslaved to labour in vain towards damnation. satan has been working towards the absolute annihilation of our world since the beginning with intent that in the end amidst the destructive chaos the antichrist will prevail and will outlive the christ. human rivalry never curbed but increased when advancements in human civilization launched humanity into the twentieth and the twenty-first centuries. with great power and potential came great audacious horror and unyielding destruction. mankind is destroying the entire planet earth in rivalry and the human race is committing global suicide against the will of god and the life of the messiah. satan is prevailing against god in destroying the world in this war and not through cosmic destruction the abomination of disease or the wrath of the elements but through the evil of humanity and the conscious choice people are making to destroy life and not to protect gods creation. this is the age of the deliverance of the messiah and the final battle between good and evil and humanity must now choose to repent from the sin that is destroying the life of our universe to be saved from satan's victory. for god to be victorious the messiah must bring salvation to the earth stopping the end of the world before death approaches and that is only possible with the cooperation of humanity because the messiah alone cannot save earth and needs an army willing to obey the commandments of god and fulfill the great commission of eternal salvation. humanity must submit to gods commandments and unite against armageddon or all may be doomed eternally by the victory of satan. humankind must decide to fallow the messiah to the heavens or it will remain on its pathway to hell defeated by satan through its own decisions actions and inactions. time is running out for the souls of the universe to be saved from eternal damnation and we must quickly take action for our god against satan and unite to save earth from destruction and our spirits from hell. god needs our actions against satan and will not have victory without our cooperation and submission to the master plan of salvation. god is with us and we must now obey the intention of the lord and rise with god against the devil. a more concise explanation of the formation of genesis all that exist in our dimension of the universe was sourced from a titanic miraculous explosion of creation and annihilation order and chaos unleashed from the powers of god and satan throughout the abyss and expanding amidst the void in to our present time. in the beginning god unleashed an almost infinite mass of elements and immense forces of gravity to spread across the nothingness against the chaotic destructive forces of satan filling the void with a cosmic stir of galaxies. god and satan miraculously manipulate the elements of force matter and mind within the universal laws of genesis that govern our reality and though their powers are miraculous they are not unlimited and are concealed in enigma. they wield gravity manipulate the evolution of elemental matter and of life and manipulate the thoughts in our minds but within the limited boundaries with limited resources and with limited freedom working to fulfill their wills. the powers of god and satan are limited by each others opposing forces censoring and resisting relentlessly and are limited by the laws of genesis that that cannot be broken by them alone but must be broken through their mortal advocates. god and satan are omnipresent and are working throughout all things secretly and miraculously but cannot manifest their wills definitely because they must evolve their plans amongst the cosmos using the elements of force matter and mind to eventually fulfill their plots over the course of eons upon eons of evolution. the elements are very chaotic outside of the absolute control of god and satan but nothing exists throughout the cosmos uninfluenced. god and satan know all things that are and know all things that once were but do not know each others thoughts or the definite future of what is to come. god and satan are incapable of manipulating or stopping time from passing and are unable to change the past or see the future. they plan the future far in advance planning since the beginning to manifest their plots into action as precisely as can be but both interfere directly with each others plans and neither can flawlessly fulfill their will. nothing can be totally controlled by either god or satan because both their influences are powerfully omniscient amongst all things and they share control throughout the cosmos warring against each other for domination. satan created the unbalance in the elements causing carnage intergalactic errors meteorites hurricanes earthquakes poisons disease biological abnormalities human atrocities social and technological complications and all evil that has ever existed throughout time within the universe. satan wills destruction upon all living things and works to destroy any and all of god's creations but god has prevailed in this war in spite of satan's power providing safety amongst the destruction for the earth to host life. god protected the earth providing the elemental necessities of life and protected and evolved life into biologically diverse species of existence that inhabit the skies the earth and oceans. god evolved life into humanity that forged upon the earth an advanced civilization that was destined to be used by god and satan for both good and evil. humanity was essential in gods plan because of its pursuits of understanding and abilities to create unlike the other species of life. humanity was destined to be the species that birthed the incarnations of the christ and the antichrist upon the earth and was created by god to be an advanced civilization of progressive achievement but satan drove humanity with greed and wickedness against god and the more power humankind obtained the more destructive it became. satan's destructive and chaotic force of evil has infested everything powerfully disturbing and destroying the order of god amongst our dimension and is working to destroy our souls eternally in victory against god but god has been labouring to defeat satan and has created order amongst the chaos protection from the destruction and a way all souls in the end can be saved through the deliverance of the messiah and the destruction of the devil's advocate in armageddon. warring amongst the cosmos god and satan for eons have been warring towards armageddon when all fate would be determined by the christ and the antichrist incarnate on earth. god and satan war throughout everything in this dimension wielding all elements in the cosmos in their own advantage and pawning all existence. god has laboured amidst the cosmos working to provide a safe haven for a planet to host the final battle against satan and succeeded in securing our planet earth amongst our chaotic dimension where it would host and sustain life orbiting around a single star out of an almost infinite reach of galaxies. god created the earth amongst the stars where it would not be destroyed by the cosmic elements so it could host the final battle and every characteristic of the planet was planned between god and satan in their war. god and satan both set their powers upon this planet and crafted it like clay each power moulding and shaping the globe in their own vision each forging their plots upon the earth towards the future the critical point where now all is unfolding. every characteristic of earth was planned between god and satans limited control over the evolution of existence. god placed our earth amongst the stars in a position where it would be safe from intergalactic disaster in a place where it could sustain life that would not parish in universal catastrophe not too distanced from the sun frozen and baron and not too close boiling in the warmth of our closest star. earth is in an orbit that has seasonal climate change and has an atmosphere that sustains existence. without the planet earth meant to bare the christ and the antichrist in armageddon the cosmos would exist in absolute vanity and nothing that exists in the endless grasp of the cosmos is more important than the life of the christ. submitted to the universal laws of genesis god and satan wield the cosmic forces throughout our dimension to influence creation and use gravity as a powerful force to move mass uniting the elements to form as the stars and the planets that amass as galaxies and in casting the spiralling galaxies amongst the abyss. unleashed in the beginning from the cosmic explosion of creation elements of cosmic gas united by gravity formed and combusted as stars that amassed into galaxies spiralling in gravities powerful thrust. caught in gravities force the planets orbit the stars in their solar systems the stars orbit amongst each other in the void forming the galaxies that orbit amongst each other throughout the abyss drawing together and colliding in a cosmic catastrophe. god and satan govern the courses of cosmic orbits and wield gravity to control the unleashing and the leashing of the elements of the universe. the forces of gravity were used by god and satan as a way to structure and organize the elemental cosmic mass and gravity was used to form the earth and manipulate the earth's evolution weaving the storms forging the molten rock and stirring the oceans. as the storms the ocean waves and the shaping of the earths terrain all were developing they were being influenced by the cosmic influences in our dimension that could reach earth from afar. struck with a cosmic flurry of a meteorite shower each crater and each mountain upon the moon over time had a major influence in the shaping of our planets characteristics and every explosion of gas and flame on the sun also had a great influence emitting varying degrees of gravitational pulls that god and satan plotted to sculpt the earth. all matter emits a force of influence and even the smallest of elements can have at least an extremely insignificant range of influence in the universe though almost absolutely zero consequence in their existence. massive galaxies and intergalactic star systems in the cosmos today within god and satans war also have absolutely zero influence on our future and have been rendered useless to god and satan existing as no more than vain far off distant cosmic forces we on earth today are unaffected by. because their influences do not reach us and in some cases their light cannot be seen from earth these colossal galaxies are today useless but at one point of time in the beginning unleashed from the same explosive source and at one time were directly part of god and satans immediate plans and may have even been our own galaxy that contained our own star if the war unfolded under different circumstances. there are massive distant galaxies that have absolutely zero influence on god and satans master plans upon the earth and on the other hand there have been microscopic entities on earth unleashed by satan that plagued the living completely transforming our future. in all the cosmos gods master plan was destined to unfold upon the earth amongst the mortals between the christ and the antichrist and what happens upon the earth to the christ and the antichrist is more important than what happens anywhere ells in the universal dimension entirely. throughout the endless reaches of space earth is most vital in gods plans to defeat satan and even though its not the universes actual core it is gods center in our universe. all manifestations that exist in our cosmos have evolved between the influences of god and satan and nothing has miraculously manifested un-sourced from the miraculous cosmic explosion of creation and annihilation in the beginning. god and satan construct compounds with the elements of matter and all things break down into the most basic elements of atoms that amass together in complex structures of complex elements that together construct everything from the stars to the elements of our biological creation. the atom is a powerful force of creation in the universe that is used by god and satan to construct all matter of elemental creation but the atom is also a great power of destruction and is a great source of energy if it is split and explosively unleashed. though it was god who first unleashed the elements the devil took and constructed with them in efforts against god. god created the elements that sustain life and provided for life so it would flourish and prevail and satan created destruction in any way possible shifting unbalance in the elements to create elemental disasters working to create chaos amongst the cosmos to prevent a world of life from existing and to make the earth that was born an uninhabitable baron waste land so no life would exist upon it. all that exists has been made manifest as offspring constructed by the original elemental creation all matter of existence roots back to the original elements that have been changing form and evolving and all life has evolved from the first entities of life that existed in the beginning and is of one universal family. life in the beginning was miraculously manifest by god the source of life force from the immense cosmic explosion of creation and remained basic single celled microscopic and sustained in the outer space without necessity until it was deposited upon the earth and evolved over eons upon eons into more advanced creatures dependent on the elements for survival. all life evolved from basic single celled microscopic entities and god and satan over time limited by the already structured chromosomes manipulated the evolution of living entities gradually causing change. god and satan manipulate the structure and development of the characteristics of living entities within the boundaries of the available chromosomes and manipulate and determine biological evolution within the limited resources manipulating the dna structures of entities. god evolved life from a microscopic primitive state of being through the evolutionary cycle into the highest state of mortal being the human being that has developed a civilization thats both awesomely progressive and horribly destructive. god and satan's influences working against each other determined everything from the elemental construction of our planet earth to the biological construction of its living beings and in spite of satan's work to prevent life from existing in this universe the earth and its entities evolved and flourished amidst what are considered natural disasters until humanity evolved into a technologically advanced civilization and overcome by greed began using its powers to destroy all life on earth divided in hateful rivalry. humanity is the species of creators who have survived the elements by developing innovations that have set them apart from any other animal as the superior species. human beings have been capable of understanding extremely complex concepts though today cannot understand some of the simplest necessities of life and are forsaking existence in desire and hatred. humans have used their knowledge and discoveries that have amassed over the generations to prosper their civilization and make the world a better place but also abuse the power that has been obtained destroying the entire planet and all life because of the evils of satan infesting and possessing the species. humanity has been capable of wielding words to express inner ideas and debate views on life organizing the knowledge compiled over the ages and generations and progressing forward with understanding. human kind is both a progressive and a regressive species that is committing global suicide in the pursuit of wealth and power in rivalry destroying an entire planet in its division. the destructive capabilities of mankind on earth are being pushed to the extremist limits by satan as humanity marches full force towards armageddon unwilling to save the planet or itself and it isn't the elemental disaster or disease that is ultimately destroying life on earth against the will of god and the life of the messiah it is the conscious choices human beings individually obtain which in the end unite in the final judgment mankind will bring upon itself. god and satan miraculously manifest thoughts into our minds limited by our own mentality and have manipulated every thought and every action to have ever occurred in this dimension of the universe. god and satan influence the content of the thoughts of all living entities but do not have total control and are restricted by the individual free thinking of the limited minds of living entities. living entities have their own free will apart from the manipulation of god and satan and though mortal minds are pawned between god and satans powers living entities obtain decision that governs their actions. human beings are overwhelmingly influenced by circumstances god and satan manipulate and god and satan both pawn the human will wielding circumstances and influences whether they are mental emotional or physical factors. god and satan indirectly determine the choices of living entities by manipulating circumstances and factors to influence the will based on what it is physically experienced physically or emotionally felt thought and believed in the human paradigm but neither god nor satan ultimately make the decision it is the living entity that must decide sometimes totally overwhelmed by the current experiences and absolutely predetermined based upon the circumstances. the free will of humanity is enslaved by satans power and is being used to destroy the entire earth. satan has been wielding human action towards armageddon and god's influence in humanity has worked to govern human beings to do what is right and has kept human kind from being entirely consumed by evil. god has manifest many good works through human beings and much good does exist amongst humanity but the masses are divided and goodness does not stand universally together in unity and in its brokenness is overcome by evils force prevailing in the chaos. satan has also destined people working through human beings to do evil instead of good causing war and destruction through men like adolph hitler joseph stalin and osama bin laden. god uses anyone and everyone possible to fulfill the cause of making a safer world for the messiah to live in and universally without favour or discrimination has been working towards peace on earth and the salvation of all who exist and satan has too been using anyone and everyone possible to fulfill its cause of destroying earth to make the planet as hazardous as possible for the coming of the christ. god and satan influence every aspect of humanity and express themselves as much as possible through human kind. god and satan are unable to directly communicate with humanity though they manipulate and influence the thinking of all life very powerfully and express themselves through living beings. to the fullest extent possible in the minds of all people at all times god and satan both express through human thought and action but are limited by human mentality and each others opposing powers within the mind. they powerfully work to manifest their own thoughts inside the minds of living creatures and manifest their own actions amidst the planet earth but can never absolutely think for us or act as us. they only influence our thoughts and actions and we make our own choices as free radicals. god has expressed the most creative loving beautiful brilliant and wonderfully unique ideas that have ever conjured in the human mind and satan has plagued minds with the most cruel shallow selfish arrogant ignorant and evil thoughts that have ever been harboured in the mentality. they both shaped our human civilization through the reasoning and actions of human beings warred all throughout history preparing for the end times. the greatest of human advancements was not discovered by accident but plotted by god from mankinds first discovery of tools and language to the technologically advanced discoveries of todays medical sciences. the worst human disasters from the world wars to the nuclear bomb were organized by satan plotting towards a horrible matricidal end of life on earth. all human actions towards the absolute good or the ultimate evil have been organized by god and satan willing their plots to be fulfilled outwards from within the human paradigm. the events throughout history have been a vicious circle unfolding throughout time and satan has been paving way to the destruction humanity is now stepping towards. god has paved way for salvation but we must all walk the path of righteousness to overcome satans power. from the early prehistoric advancements of humankind to the modern technological advancements god and satan have been working through human beings pawning the growth of our civilization. every moment of war and moment of peace and every achievement and failure has been ordered by the higher powers of god and satan and all have contributed to the state of our existence. the ultimate chaos has engulfed mankind and the clash of the titans between the light and the darkness leaves everything a deep shade of grey fading into pitch blackness. god revelled to early human beings the concept of a god giving human beings a sense of reverence to a higher authority and a fear of being punished for disobedience. the ancient world was filled with lawlessness and chaotic terror just like today and often the only source of moral order and law was in the form of religion. god reviled the concept his presence to human kind but could only plant a seed to fuel humanitys wonder and curiosity with the powerful idea of higher power and could not concisely explain the truth of the universe or command human beings clearly because of the laws of genesis restricting god's presence from being to humankind. mankind took the wonder and curiosity god and pursued creating philosophical beliefs to explain the truth of the creator and the meaning of its creations and god and satan both manipulated and influenced humanities creations of philosophy both powerfully influencing the human mind. god expressed as much truth through human philosophy as possible inspiring tales of the presence of the creator amongst human beings a messiah a devil salvation damnation a heaven and a hell and very definitely contrasted good and evil and the consequences of either being righteous or sinful leading to eternal paradise or eternal suffering. god provided as many lessons and logic in religion and philosophy as possible that have aided in making the earth a better place and provided human beings with moral advice and teachings that help them make the right choices in life but no religion is immaculate only the word of god through living christ himself can be the pure word of god. satan plagued religion and philosophy with lies and superstitious legalism and pawned the human mind into viewing life through narrow beliefs arrogantly and stubbornly decided upon gullibly in conclusion. satan has used religion for evil to cause conflict amongst extremist human beings or to excuse the idle inaction of the placid and ignorant. the only use god has of religion is towards a universal peace and harmony amongst human beings raising the spiritual awareness of human beings and religions do contribute in some ways to peace on earth but satan uses religion to divide the masses of superstitious believers against god and towards a destructive armageddon. salvation will not be granted through beliefs or even though gods forgiveness or whole hearted individual pursuits of god. salvation will be granted through the victory of god over satan through the deliverance of the messiah and the destruction of the antichrist and all of humanity must now stand against the armageddon. all of us will be saved or none of us will be saved and all of our individual choices together will pass the final judgment on ourselves and we will decide who reigns in the universe through our deeds contributing to either salvation or damnation. we have time to defeat the devil and only together will we triumph against the evils that are in fact prevailing to destroy us. god is with us and we must serve the lord for our souls to be saved. we need to save the earth and destroy the antichrist and must now take all action we can to reach the heavens and save our souls. the upheaval of all upheavals breaking down the war between god and satan throughout humankinds history we will be focusing on our most recent modern historical events especially considering the events of the 20th century leading us into our new millennium. historical evidence will be provided in a way that clearly personifies the war between god and satan resonating amidst all creation throughout all of history. reflecting on the fact that absolutely all history was made manifest amidst the war of god and satan i could not possibly report absolutely everything which has taken place throughout the ages. history is far too immense to contain its entirety within my testimony. so i will clearly exemplify the clash of the titans manifesting throughout all of history using our modern history as the greatest example. no historical evidence is more soundly reliable then that which has transpired within the last  years or so and no events to have ever taken place in our human history have shaken the foundation of our entire universe more then that which has occurred in the 20th and now the 21st centuries. i will carefully engage in examining key historical events as they unfolded presenting them in a corresponding array of precisely plotted actions planned between god and satan. this analysis will prove concisely with substantial evidence that god and satans war is not only unfolding but blazing at its zenith and climatically reaching an ultimate end in the final judgement. the 20th century on into our present time was a vicious circle of both unprecedented human achievement and catastrophic destruction in the name of human advancement. like a colossally chaotic chain reaction of events one great event resonated like the ripples in a pond into the immensity of universal consequence and one event after the other compiled together to result in the present state of existence we face today in armageddon that which greatly exceeds the sum of all fears. gazing at the records of our modern history it is very obvious to notice that at the beginning of the 20th century nearly everything was revolutionized drastically as we took our first steps into a century of growth at abysmal proportions. but the power mankind had achieved was far beyond its capability to control and by the end of the 20th century over the course of one hundred very short years the earth has been almost utterly devoured by the human race and we have become the architects of our own demise. technology hath wrought the destruction of its inventor just as living creation hath wrought the downfall of the lord. the devils secret agenda has been manifesting upon the earth since its beginning triumphing into our modern times. in the 20th century entering the 21st century one stage of the devils plan unfolded after another. from the assassination of the archduke franz ferdinand of austria hungary directly leading to world war one to the terrorist attacks of september 11th on world trade center leading to the war on terror all evil has been sourced from satan master minding our apocalypse. the devil has been fulfilling multiple stages of its plans towards the final stage of armageddon wielding human evil as the ultimate weapon of mass destruction to destroy the earth and the messiah slaying our souls forever. much of what god orchestrated throughout history and especially in the last  years was to protect and nurture life on earth and aid in the messiahs deliverance in the final days when the holy rapture of god could finally be fulfilled. god advanced technological communications medical sciences education peace on earth environmentalism the fight for equal human rights the fight against hunger and poverty and absolutely everything and anything that has benefited our world today. all good has emerged from the source of all life our god with the divine purpose of contributing to the salvation of our souls but as it was once stated by jesus the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few and little progress is being made to counteract the absolute desecration of earth. there is so much essential work that must be done before we can have salvation but the world is full of the unrighteous the idle and the callas and the divine calling of the lord is still left unanswered by our disgraceful species. the championship of warfare all mortal war is waged between god and satan both powerfully manipulating all sides of every conflict. every thought and action in each and every individual fighting for their cause is manipulated by the warring spiritual forces of the lord and the devil. the clash of the titans manifesting in human conflict is what determines the outcome of nearly every war. it is not human cunning material resources manpower or a specific set of circumstances alone that determine victory or defeat amidst the colliding armies of man. it is especially the divine grace of god working against the diabolic conniving of satan that finalizes the victory and defeat in the wars of mankind. though gods inner intention is that of divine peace in wicked times of war when satan is uprising through armed force god is compelled into a position where it is essential manipulate the outcome of a war in order to resist satan from shifting the balance of power in its favour. god is forced to war amongst humanity against satan engaged in the clash of the titans in the mortal dimension of human thought and action. god is imprisoned in a universal war fighting for the very survival of the heavens and our souls forever and every aspect of this universal war including the wars of humanity is part of gods desperate struggle to bless all eternity with salvation. war aided drastically in shaping our world today amidst the rampage of tribal power struggles immersing us into the depths of the end of days. it has been of the leading causes of catastrophe upon the planet since the dawn of mankind and has always had a severely tragic impact upon human civilization and its many divided diversities. almost every major power shift throughout history has come as a result of war amidst human beings. but this is not always the case. change has manifest on earth by peaceful means as well for example the actions of mohandas ghandi and his followers led to indian independence from british colonialism. this was done peacefully without using any form of violence but instead using nonviolent civil disobedience. war is the prelude to more war. it leaves humankind trapped in a suicidal vicious circle of violent upheavals and vengeful reprisal as the conflict and suffering only further spread like a terrible infectious disease. world war one was falsely coined the war to end all wars but it itself only led to a larger far more destructive war only two decades later. this is valid proof that suggests war is not the solution to solving political disputes. it only leads to further decimation which can continue for generations upon generations. we in essence could very well be continuing wars today that started amongst our ancestry generations ago because the consequences of yesterdays wars are still resonating throughout our universe today and now the antipathy of our forefathers is still blazing in the firestorms of todays warfare. this destructive cycle must stop immediately if we do not want our world to succumb to the apocalypse damning our souls forever unto hell. it is essential that we put an end to our wars and surrender to peace walking in the divine light of god. we must turn away from the vindictive way of satan all our prior generations have fallowed unto the righteous way of the lord or we will perish in an eternal aftermath of forfeiting forever to the devil. throughout all of time species of life have been at war. many animal species war against each other for survival but we humans war out of greed and hatred. warring for survival is a natural part of mortal existence but we humans drag this innate struggle to the extreme of global ruin. we know no bounds to our totalitarian oppression of all life on earth killing one another and countless animal species in desecration of our worlds environments and the war amongst our global communities. human warfare is terribly unnatural amidst the balance of life. it is carried out with unholy intentions to eliminate and ravage a perceived enemy. it is carried out inspired by religious beliefs national origin race color political affiliation and likely any other possible distinctions you can make between people. in several circumstances war is essential for survival from utter annihilation under the reign of an evil enemy an enemy like nazi germany who not only caused the deaths of millions of soldiers but belligerently slaughtered millions of civilians systematically. however we have become so consumed by war we are going to bring about the apocalypse in rapid succession. within the evolution of our civilization it is now time that we evolve beyond war and become at last the superior species a species of peacemakers not a pack of rabid dogs. when we can all share in the conscious awakening of divine peace we will all share in the benefits of divine peace. our world will become a safe haven for the meek who will finally truly inherit the earth and brutality will have no place in human civilization. we will have reached the next level of human development a level that cannot be reached through new groundbreaking scientific technological or medical breakthroughs but only through the unprecedented revolution of peace on earth. it is through this revolution of peace on earth that gods holy rapture will manifest in the deliverance of christ. we must unconditionally reconcile our differences together universally collaborating with people with differences in national origin race color religious beliefs mental and physical abilities gender sexuality culture social class and citizenship etc. there are billions of different people in the world and we can make an almost unlimited amount of distinctions between individuals but the anointing of god is beyond these distinctions and is a universally uniting force of peaceful harmony between the immense diversities amidst the kaleidoscope of life. it is an anointing we are meant to fulfill living peaceful righteous lives uncorrupted by the wickedness of satan. instead of warring amongst each other we must fight a holy war against the powerful wickedness of satan. one must turn inward insides ones self repenting of sin and shunning evil. then one must set a righteous example before the impenitent brothers and sisters shining the light of god amidst the darkness of the devil. we are commanded by god to live in peace with our many diverse brothers and sisters and in harmony with god living nonviolent and humble lives that worship the lord in fulfillment of his holy intentions upon the earth. we are expected to uphold the divinity code walking in the light of christ in absolute submission to gods divine anointing. this cannot be done with a malicious heart and cruel intentions. one must repent of the ungodliness of satan within and strive to live in a state of absolute harmony in peace with all life forms. war is devils play the battle field is the devils playground and human beings who engage in warfare only place the wager of their temporal finite lives on eternal damnation. it is the greatest manifestation of satans evil and throughout history has been the most vital priority in the devils plans to pave the way towards armageddon. satan is the source at the heart of every war. the fissure cracks open in a monolithic cataclysm and all hell breaks loose upon the earth. through the faults the devil floods like a cascade flowing through every breach in gods security throughout every outlet in the entire spectrum of our universe. satans a virus in the system that is infests our universe like an insidious disease a shadow gradually devouring all light until everything fades into pitch black abyss. powered by nationalistic arrogance and racism leaders like adolph hitler of germany mussolini of italy mao zedong of china and joseph stalin of russia reined tyranny upon the innocent killing mass millions of people. driven by the devils torrential force human kinds nationalistic will for power drove men to suppress one another like in the cases of the berlin wall the holocaust and human slavery where oppression prospered. the devil manipulated these demagogues who only had to falsely promise the people their selfish yearnings to gain mass support to unleash the bitter hatred satan cultivated in them upon others. blind like sheep human beings throughout time have been ignorant and placid followers of their also blind leaders. the blind lead the blind and cannot see the darkness they are consumed by. satan places diabolic puppets in positions of great power and wields its pawns to cause immense devastation. the devil seizes every advantage in placing its pawns in positions of great power for the wicked purpose of reigning tyranny down upon the planet earth. in the early 20th century the devils influence caused many great upheavals that shifted power in a great unstable period of global change. many power struggles erupted between warring factions like in china with the struggle between chan kai check who wanted to create a more democratic china and mao zedong a chinese communist warlord adolph hitler triumphantly gained power over germany even after failing to pull off an armed coup against the democratic german bavarian government mussolini in italy marched on rome with  thousand fascists successfully overthrowing the italian king and joseph stallion in russia exiled and assassinated political rivals like leon trotsky to secure his leadership of the communist government. these examples are only a few of satans manipulative manoeuvres to place tyrants in positions of supreme power. they would all play major roles in the devils plans to destroy earth placed in key positions of dictatorship and provided with totalitarian power to abuse. these totalitarian dictators at the climatic peek of their leadership had their people believing them to be the epic saviours of their nations yet directly inflicted millions of innocents with suffering and death. the devil triggered world war one with the single spark of the assassins mark. on the 28th of june  archduke franz ferdinand the heir to the throne of austria-hungary and his wife sophie chotek the duchess of hohenberg were assassinated by the serbian nationalist gayrilo princip. the assassinations along with the arms race nationalism and the alliance system all greatly contributed to the beginning of world war i which began less than two months after franz ferdinand's death with austria-hungarys declaration of war against serbia. austria-hungarys declaration of war on serbia was sponsored by germany. russia and france came to the aid of serbia and when germany invaded belgium britain declared war siding with the russia-france serbia alliance. the mind of the assassin was targeted by the devil and all these countries were set up to enter the war like an unbroken chain of falling dominoes. tied through alliance these super powers raised arms and spontaneously combusted in one of the most destructive wars of our history. but even without the assassination which may have only been an excuse to launch the war a world war seemed imminent with the nationalistically fuelled arms race and coinciding alliance system. sooner or later something or someone was going to setoff this vicious circle of destruction though few could have guessed the extent and of the damage caused by the horror which would occur. satan had prepared well for this monolithic catastrophe and only needed to light the fuse with the assassination in order to set off the cataclysm it rigged to explode. within  months over  million soldiers from eight nations and their colonies were at war with each other. driven by bravery pride and thoughts of adventure masses of men naively flocked to arms to battle in battle for their nations. the devil was able to capture the minds of the young urging them to war fuelling their dreams of adventure and desensitising them to the true brutality they would face. by the end of world war of the  million men who were mobilized more than  million were killed and more than  million wounded. the war progressed into a clash between two main coalitions of european countries. the first coalition known as the allied powers was sponsored by god and eventually included france the united kingdom belgium serbia montenegro canada japan italy and russia. the central powers opposed to them was sponsored by the devil and consisted of germany austria-hungary the ottoman empire and bulgaria. although initially the united states remained neutral it joined the allies in . the conflict eventually involved  nations  of which supported the allies. however some of these nations did not participate in the actual fighting. western and eastern fronts were quickly formed along the borders of germany and austria-hungary. the first month of combat consisted of bold attacks and rapid troop movements on both fronts. in the west germany attacked initially belgium and then france. in the east russia attacked both germany and austria-hungary. in the south austria-hungary attacked serbia. following the first battle of the marne known as the miracle of marne september   the western front became entrenched in central france and remained that way for the rest of the war. miracle of marne schliefen plan ect.ect make this point clear. late in  the ottoman empire entered into the war as well after signing the ottoman-german alliance. as a result much of  was dominated by allied actions against the ottomans in the mediterranean. first britain and france launched a failed attack on the dardanelles. this campaign was followed up by the british invasion of the gallipoli peninsula. britain also launched a separate campaign against the turks in mesopotamia. although the british achieved some victory in mesopotamia the gallipoli campaign and the attacks on the dardanelles resulted in british defeats. the middle part of the war  and  was dominated by perpetual trench warfare in both the east and the west. soldiers fought from dug-in positions striking at each other with machine guns heavy artillery and chemical weapons. though soldiers died by the millions in brutal conditions neither side had any substantial success or gained any advantage. despite the stalemate on both fronts in europe two important developments in the war occurred in . in early april the united states declared war on germany angered by attacks upon its ships in the atlantic. then in november the bolshevik revolution prompted russia to pull out of the war agreeing to a costly peace treaty with the central power. this allowed the transfer of the central powers troops from the eastern front to the western front. although both sides of the war unleashed rekindled offensives in  in an all-or-nothing effort to win the war efforts on both sides failed. the warring between exhausted demoralized troops continued to drag on until the germans lost a number of individual battles and very gradually began to fall back. a deadly outbreak of influenza unleashed by satan meanwhile took heavy tolls on soldiers of both sides. eventually the governments of both germany and austria-hungary began to lose control as both countries experienced multiple mutinies from within their military structures. the war ended in the late fall of  after the member countries of the central powers signed armistice agreements one by one. germany was the last signing its armistice on november  . as a result of these agreements austria-hungary was broken up into several smaller countries. germany under the treaty of versailles was severely punished with hefty economic reparations territorial losses and strict limits on its rights to develop militarily. amidst the aftermath of world war i the political order of europe came crashing to the ground. the german austro-hungarian and russian empires ceased to exist and the ottoman empire soon followed them into oblivion. new nations emerged borders were radically shifted and ethnic conflicts erupted. victors and vanquished alike faced enormous recovery challenges after four years of financial loss economic deprivation and material destruction. amid this chaotic situation the leaders of the victorious coalition assembled in paris to forge a new international system that would replace the old order. the decisions they made would determine the future of europe and much of the rest of the world for decades to come. it was uncannily prophetic that the marshal foch of france spoke saying this is not peace. it is an armistice for twenty years. as it turned out he was very accurate in his prediction of when humanity would be plunged into a second world war. world war ii was a conflict that would surpass its predecessor in the number of deaths and injuries the extent of physical destruction and the geographical area affected. the terrible experiences of world war ii have tended to overshadow the memory of the war that broke out in the summer of . but world war i unquestionably represented a major turning point in history and its consequences are still felt throughout the world. what woodrow wilson the 28th president of the united states  called the war to end all wars led to within a generation a second even more destructive conflict. amid this political turmoil on june   the treaty of versailles was signed by the victorious allies and was then obediently confirmed by the newly formed german democratic government. under the terms of the treaty germany alone was forced to accept responsibility for causing the war and had to pay huge war reparations for all the damage. germany also had to give up land to france and poland and give up its colonial territories. the financial reparations further exhausted the german economy and the price of basic need like food and shelter exploded causing great turmoil amongst german civilians. multiple terms were aimed at preventing germanys army from gaining superiority again posing a threat. these termed included a limitation of germanys army to  men with no conscriptions no tanks no heavy artillery no poison-gas supplies no aircraft and no airships. it also limited the size of the german navy and prohibited the use of submarines. the terms imposed on germany at versailles were much more mild than those germany had imposed on russia the brest-litovsk treaty summer  or those that germany planned to impose on the western allies if she had won the war  including among other things the subjugation of belgium an innocent victim of german aggression in . the treaty had the effect of humiliating the german nation before the world. this would lead to a passionate desire in many germans including adolf hitler to see their nation throw off the shackles of the treaty and once again take its place in the world the rebirth of germany through a strong nationalist government. in years to come hitler would speak out endlessly against the treaty and gain much support. the german government after defeat in the first world war faced total depression of the economy and the people. everyone lost their savings and soon food was too expensive to purchase with the german mark because of inflation. the treaty of versailles completely suppressed the german people and gave them little room for economic recovery causing a great depression in germany and severe unrest for millions of struggling german people. the contempt amongst the german people helped place hitler and the nazi party in power for he promised them the hope of german superiority. had the versailles treaty been applied as envisioned germany would not have been rearming in . the fact that germany did rearm was not a problem brought about by the treaty. in the end versailles was insufficient for obtaining the goals. it neither crushed germany enough to stop her rise again yet it was still able to humiliate her. germany later in the years to fallow completely ignored the treatys terms and mass produced arms to prepare for war yet again. this was made possible with the devils manipulation that acted as a decoy to delay and prevent the league of nations from responding to the threat of the german nazi regime. the treaty itself only succeeded in agitating the german people creating the animosity hitler exploited to rise to power. it failed in all its fundamental goals especially the goal of preventing another world war because the terms of the treaty were not enforced by the league of nations. overview of the treaty the terms of the treaty which germany had no choice but to accept were announced on may  . germany lost:   of its national territory  all of its overseas colonies including kamerun german east africa german southwest africa togoland and german new guinea  . of its population   of its coalfields and half its iron and steel industry.  union with austria anschluss forbidden. territorial restrictions on germany  alsace-lorraine yielded

least  years.  manufacturing of weapons is prohibited.  import and export of weapons is prohibited.  manufacture or stockpiling of poison gas is prohibited.  tanks are prohibited.  naval forces

displacement each.  submarines are prohibited.  military aircraft are prohibited.  artillery is prohibited.  blockades on ports are prohibited. legal restrictions on germany  article : forced to accept sole responsibility of war and had to promise to make good all the damage done to civilian population of the allies. also known as the war guilt clause.  article : former german emperor wilhelm ii was charged with supreme offence against international morality. he was to be tried as a war criminal.  article : many were tried as war criminals. some could not be tried as they were hiding. the league of nations the league of nations was an international organization founded as a result of the treaty of versailles in  in the aftermath of the devastating first world war. the league's goals included disarmament preventing war through collective security settling disputes between countries through negotiation diplomacy and improving global welfare. the diplomatic philosophy behind the league represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. the league lacked an armed force of its own and so depended on the great powers to enforce its resolutions keep to economic sanctions which the league ordered or provide an army when needed for the league to use. however they were often very reluctant to do so. the league of nations was to be based in geneva switzerland. this choice was natural as switzerland was a neutral country and had not fought in world war one. no one could dispute this choice especially as an international organisation such as the red cross was already based in switzerland. the united states of america whose president woodrow wilson had dreamt up the idea of the league refused to join it. as america was the worlds most powerful nation this was a serious blow to the prestige of the league. however americas refusal to join the league fitted in with her desire to have an isolationist policy throughout the world. germany was not allowed to join the league in . because germany had started the war according to the treaty of versailles one of her punishments was that she was not considered to be a member of the international community and therefore she was not invited to join. this was a great blow to germany but it also meant that the league could not use whatever strength germany had to support its campaign against aggressor nations. russia was also not allowed to join as in  it had a communist government that generated fear in western europe and in  the russian royal family was murdered by the bolshevik authorities. such a country could not be allowed to take its place in the league. therefore three of the worlds most powerful nations played nearly no part in supporting the league. the two most powerful members were britain and france. both had suffered financially and militarily during the war and neither was enthusiastic to get involved in disputes that did not affect western europe. therefore the league had a fine ideal to end war for good. however if an aggressor nation was determined enough to ignore the leagues verbal warnings all the league could do was enforce economic sanctions and hope that these worked as it had no chance or enforcing its decisions using military might. although germany eventually joined the league in  the national socialist nazi government withdrew in . japan also withdrew in  after japanese attacks on china were condemned by the league. and the ussr a member since  was expelled following the soviet attack on finland in . never truly effective as a peacekeeping organization the lasting importance of the league of nations lies in the fact that it provided the groundwork for the un. this international alliance formed after world war ii not only profited by the mistakes of the league of nations but borrowed much of the organizational machinery of the league. russian revolutions of  in  the russians left the world war as a result of the russian revolutions two revolutions that occurred in russia in . the first revolution in february overthrew the russian monarchy. the second revolution in october created the worlds first communist state. the revolutions which were at heart a direct consequence of the devastation of the firsts world war paved way to the securing of the power of the soviet union ussr. in the devils agenda the soviet power would help stage in decades to come the greatest nuclear crisis of the 20th century. the cold war between the united states and the soviet union became the center of the worlds politics soon after the world war as the arms race continued to monolithic extremes and the growing chance of nuclear war then became the greatest threat against gods plans upon the earth. satan prepared the way for the next fazes of its plans using world war i to the full advantage of advancing the armageddon. the russian revolution of  centers around two primary events: the february revolution and the october revolution. the february revolution which removed tsar nicholas ii from power developed spontaneously out of a series of increasingly violent demonstrations and riots on the streets of petrograd present-day st. petersburg during a time when the tsar was away from the capital visiting troops on the world war i front. though the february revolution was a popular uprising it did not necessarily express the wishes of the majority of the russian population as the event was primarily limited to the city of petrograd. however most of those who took power after the february revolution in the provisional government the temporary government that replaced the tsar and in the petrograd soviet an influential local council representing workers and soldiers in petrograd generally favoured rule that was at least partially democratic. the october revolution also called the bolshevik revolution overturned the interim provisional government and established the soviet union a communist regime. the october revolution was a much more deliberate event orchestrated by a small group of people. the bolsheviks dedicated hardliner communists who led this coup prepared their coup in only six months. they were generally viewed as an extremist group and had very little popular support when they began serious efforts in april . by october the bolsheviks popular base was much larger though still a minority within the country as a whole they had built up a majority of support within petrograd and other urban centers. after october the bolsheviks realized that they could not maintain power in an election-based system without sharing power with other parties and compromising their principles. as a result they formally abandoned the democratic process in january  and declared themselves the representatives of a dictatorship of the proletariat. in response the russian civil war broke out in the summer of that year and would last well into . communism scientific socialism is a political and economic system that became one of the most powerful forces in the world. it shaped much of history from the early 1900s to the 1990s. some people have considered communism the greatest threat to world peace. others have looked on it as the world's greatest hope. the term communism has several meanings. communism can be a form of government an economic system a revolutionary movement a way of life or a goal or ideal. communism is also a set of ideas about how and why history moves and in what direction it is headed. these ideas were developed mainly by vladimir lenin from the writings of karl marx. lenin was a russian revolutionary leader of the early 1900s, and marx was a german social philosopher in the 1800s. according to communists their long-range goal is a society that provides equality and economic security for all. communists traditionally have called for government ownership rather than private ownership of land factories and other economic resources called the means of production. they also have called for government planning of economic activity and for strict rule by the communist party. in its ideological essence communism has fair prospects for equal distribution of prosperity amongst the entire community but in the struggle to apply and enforce the doctrine of communism we have seen some of the most brutally wicked dictatorships arise amidst the national maelstrom. leaders like joseph stalin and mao zedong caused the deaths of millions of their own subjects with the totalitarian control they had over their nations. the brilliant ideals of communism have been spoiled by the belligerence of communist parties who abuse the absolute power they extend upon their subjects in the name of upholding their communist doctrine. this corrupted abusive tyrannical control is what is most to blame for communisms disgraceful failure throughout the 20th century. it is by gods divinity that all men are created equal. therefore people aught to strive towards absolute equality a utopian democratic communism also known as universalism where not only all people have equal prosperity but all people have the democratic rights to elect the governmental parties of their choosing. democratic communism provides people freedom to elect political representatives who can distribute wealth fairly and equality and bring necessary reforms in order to correct systematic failure and political stagnation. this is a combination of american and soviet systematic policies aspects that perpetually divided them during the cold war. the democratic liberties of the united states of america combined with the communist resolve of equal distribution of national prosperity. both democracy and communism are ideals god inspired in humanity but apart from one another these policies fail. fair nations should strive to be completely democratic politically in an economic state of absolute communism. democratic communism would be a just system of governing especially in regards to restricting national consumption and pollution a problem that poses serious threats to the health of our entire planet earth with the destruction of our worlds essential environments. democracy and communism are both elements of true universalism. universalism would be considered democratic communist and environmentalist. its fair constitution would provide the people with equal civil rights a free democratic voice in the nation and equal access to the nations resources and it would seek to protect the environments from exploitation of resources which destroys our ecosystems desecrating biological diversity leading to the extinction of many animal species. tyrannical communist dictatorships seek to fulfill their policies manifesting the communist doctrine by brutal means of genocide. tyrants rise up to clutch power in an iron gauntlet of oppressive force stifling dissent by desecrating opposition. the people within these belligerent nations experience no freedom therefore have little true prosperity for the greatest prosperity is the liberty of ones self from persecution and poverty. bellow is an unofficially estimated list of deaths caused by tyrannical communist regimes in the 20th century totaling roughly  million people.   million in the soviet union   million in the people's republic of china   million in vietnam   million in north korea   million in cambodia   million in the communist states of eastern europe   thousand in latin america  . million in africa  . million in afghanistan   thousand resulting from actions of the international communist movement and communist parties not in power. this explicitly suggests that communist regimes are responsible for a greater number of deaths than any other political ideal or movement including nazism. the statistics of victims includes executions intentional destruction of population by starvation and deaths resulting from deportations physical confinement or through forced labour. it does not include excess deaths due to higher mortality or lower birth rates than expected of the population. these figures show the absolute failure of communist dictatorships but does it mean that the founding principles of communism are evil? i would believe it not to be the of communism but the process of manifesting the communist ideals in the world. using extremism and terror to desecrate any fair opposition to communism totalitarian regimes have slaughtered millions to uphold the communist creed which is defiled by a denial of peoples most basic human rights. true communism is developed fairly and patiently through democracy using moderate non violent means to bring gradual change to a nation. it becomes a progressive goal to strive towards and a tenacious value to uphold through peaceful means not a sudden atomic explosion of violence and oppression. capitalism generally refers to an economic and social system in which the means of production are predominantly privately owned and operated and in which investments distribution income production and pricing of goods and services are determined through the operation of a market economy. unfortunately private ownership of economic power creates an immense schism between the rich and the poor. in the united states of america the wealthiest  of the population holds . of total wealth. in contrast to communism capitalism creates extreme poverty all over the world for billions of people. the vast majority of wealth ends up in the hands of a small minority of ravenous gluttons while poverty inflicts people all over the world in the name of upper class prosperity. scorched by the immense greed of the first world capitalist nations amidst the ashes of poverty the third world is born devastated.  each year more than  million people around the world die because they are too poor to stay alive.  over  billion people in  people around the worldlive in extreme poverty defined living on less than  a day.  currently over one billion people lack access to a basic supply of clean water and . billion people do not have access to basic sanitation.  unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation play a major role in the transmission of diseases including malaria cholera diarrhoea and typhoid. more than . million children die each year roughly one child every  seconds from water and sanitation-related diarrhoeal diseases.  more than  million go hungry each day. if you add up all the pain suffering and death that manifests in the world as a result of global capitalism i think you would find substantial evidence that suggests the destructive plight of poverty caused by the ravenous prosperity of capitalist nations surpasses the destruction caused by communist regimes. so amidst all the bickering about the fundamental principles of manifestations of communism vs manifestations of capitalism i have come to understand both capitalism and totalitarian communism are evil. in the 20th century modern communist regimes became the greatest belligerent threat to peace on earth and modern capitalist nations became the greatest plight on not only the third world but our planets environments. both have utterly failed and caused ruin to our world and have disgraced our human civilization and the god who created us. the spanish influenza avian flu strain in addition to the devastation world war one around the same time successfully the devil birthed and unleashed a pandemic known as the spanish flu. the  pandemic was the most destructive in recorded history. it started as world war i  was concluding and caused anywhere from  million to  million deaths two to five times as many deaths as the war itself. when and where the pandemic began is unknown but because spain was inflicted with the first major outbreak the disease came to be known as the spanish flu. the virus was extremely lethal and many of the deaths were among young adults age  to  a group usually not severely affected by influenza. scientists in  successfully reconstructed the  influenza virus after finding samples of the virus in the preserved tissues of three people killed by the spanish flu. in conclusion the scientists reported that it was an avian flu virus that spread directly to humans. the virus penetrated deep into human lung tissue causing a type of pneumonia that was capable of killing the young and healthy. today another deadly strain of avian flu known as the avian bird flu hn has the potential of being the next colossal pandemic on an unprecedented scale. scientists say millions even billions of our worlds population could die and it could cost our worlds economies over  trillion dollars devastating our world with another great depression. currently the virus is being spread amongst birds and is not capable of passing from human to human. this could easily change if the virus evolves mutating in to an even more deadly disease which passes between human beings. between from  when the first human cases of the virus emerged to the beginning of  there were  cases and  deaths from the hn strain of the avian flu avian bird flu. the cause of the disease was human contact with birds infected with the hn virus. satan used world war i to manifest the second world war. the consequences of this initial upheaval of the first world war have raged on for almost a century and now we find ourselves in the apocalypse we wrought with our own stupidity. we began taking steps towards the utter destruction of earth and though each step reaped devastation upon our world we continued racing towards the armageddon. hitler and nazi germany adolph hitler was one of satans greatest weapons of mass destruction possessed by his own arrogant dreams of conquest over all of humanity. driven by nationalistic pride for the aryan race and a deep hate races he was given immense power by satan used to unleash systematic carnage upon millions and millions of innocents. adolph was a tyrant who in his lifetime caused arguably the greatest horrors that has ever been made manifest upon this planet. some argue he may himself have been the antichrist in flesh and few would disagree in saying he was surely a devils advocate. the rise of nazi germany was the capstone of the inter-war period and led to the outbreak of world war ii shattering the delicate peace that fallowed the first world war. the nazi regime's progress was paralleled by the life of its leader adolf hitler. hitlers rise to power brought about the single greatest conflict to have ever unleashed amongst the colliding tribes of mankind. born in a small town in austria hitler dreamed of becoming a great artist. unable to demonstrate sufficient artistic skill for entrance into the art academy in vienna he did odd jobs and developed an interest in politics. in his youth hitler was a lazy slacker who drifted aimlessly without any real purpose in life. it is very difficult to imagine this straggler growing up to become one of the greatest tyrants of all time but his anointing of evil would manifest in a destiny so wicked it would shatter the earth destroying millions of lives. in  hitler joined the german army going on to earn the iron cross for bravery as a message-carrier. though he exercised courage his superiors never promoted him during the war because they felt he lacked leadership qualities. hitler saw trench warfare as a form of the struggle for survival among races a struggle that he was coming to as the essence of existence. at the same time his anti-semitic feelings were growing more and more extreme. throughout most of the war hitler had the devils luck avoiding life threatening injury. more than once he moved away from a spot where moments later a shell exploded killing or wounding everyone. on october   he had however received wounds in the battle of somme from which he recovered to return to the war and when germany was defeated in  hitler was lying in a military hospital temporarily blinded by mustard gas. he was immensely distraught by the german defeat in world war i and blamed the loss on the marxists and jews who he said had surrendered the nation. satan uncannily preserved hitler throughout his service in the world war protecting his life preparing for his future. he avoided death many times in the war and would continue to defy death throughout the rest of the life dodging multiple assassination attempts up until the point of committing suicide when it became fully evident that germany had lost the second world war. in  hitler seized control in the german workers party changing its name to the national socialist german workers party called the nazi party for short. he worked hard to spearhead the party into popularity over the next few years bringing it far as its front man and forerunner. his highly emotional at times hysterical tirades against things like the treaty of versailles marxists and jews brought him considerable amounts of attention from many germans. because of hitlers powerful political initiatives the small nazi party was brought into the mainstream of german politics swelling to thousands of members then eventually to millions taking over the entire german government. satan empowered the nazi party with the support of many german people imbuing adolf hitler with a diabolic charisma millions were unable to resist. the devil worked to spread the nazi doctrine until it engrossed the entire german population. hitlers passionate speeches and radical arguments were spellbinding. satan pawned hitler into the political maelstrom captivating the entire german nation under the nazi reign. key steps in devils agenda to destroy the world in armageddon would manifest with the wrath of hitler but first hitler would need total control of the german people. in the early 1920s, due to the immense inflation of the german mark germans lost their life savings salaries were paid in worthless money food was too expensive to purchase and hunger riots broke out. the economic strife was a result of germanys defeat in world war one and the burdensome terms of the treaty of versailles. it was in this chaotic setting that the nazis made their first attempt to seize power. the german state of bavaria where the nazis were based was a breeding ground of groups opposed to the democratic government in berlin. by november of  the nazis with  followers were the biggest and best organized of these groups. with nazi members demanding action hitler knew he had to act or risk losing the leadership of his party. on november   hitler and world war i hero general ludendorf attempted a small revolution known today as the beer hall putsch beer hall they hatched a plot to kidnap leaders of the bavarian government and force them at gunpoint to accept hitler as their leader. meanwhile general ludendorf would attempt to win over support from the army and they all together would declare a nationwide revolution. this daring coup was modeled after mussolinis fascist coup in italy where the national fascist party successfully seized power from the italian king. but it would end in humiliation for hitler and lead to his imprisonment. on november   hitler and  armed members of the sturmabteilungen or sa a nazi paramilitary force made their move. they marched on a munich beer hall where gustav von kahr head of the provincial bavarian government was addressing a public meeting. hitler took von kahr and his associates hostage and declared in von kahr's name the formation of a new national government. held at gunpoint the bavarian government representatives were reluctantly forced to comply and pledge allegiance to the nazis but upon von kahrs release he immediately retracted the statement outlawed the nazi party and ordered the bavarian police to crush hitlers revolution. undaunted hitler and his men led a march to the center of munich the following day. state police halted the march shooting started and  nazis and  bavarian police were killed. hitler was wrenched to the ground and suffered a dislocated shoulder when the man he was locked arms with was shot. hitler's bodyguard ulrich graf then jumped onto hitler to shield him and took several bullets probably saving hitler's life. lacking enough support hitler had no chance against the police and military power of the bavarian government. the so-called revolution had failed. hitler fled but was soon arrested and tried. in court he practically took over the proceedings denouncing both the weimar republic and the bavarian government. hitler was sentenced to five years in prison for treason but was released after less than one year. his release was another move of the devil freeing him to continue advancing satans agenda. it was god who orchestrated the beer hall putsch in an attempt to bring an early end to hitler and the nazi party. a violent revolt just may have succeeded if the nazis were properly prepared with enough support to crush the counterrevolutionary resistance but they werent and their premature coup ended in failure. hitler was nearly shot and was arrested charged and jailed for high treason. his death would have avoided the second world war robbing satan of its key advocate of death but the satanic anointing of the devil would once again protect hitlers life preserving him for his purely diabolic purpose. due to the economic unrest hitler was very impatient and had serious of pressure from his followers to take action. they were not prepared for a violent confrontation with the bavarian government and expected to win over vast support from the army they never received. the situation quickly turned disastrously for the nazis. however the beer hall putsch failed at bringing an end to hitlers life or political career. in fact it helped by providing hitler and the nazis exposure and increased their popularity. overnight hitler became a nationally and internationally known figure due to massive press coverage. satan countered the failure of the revolt by manipulating hitlers trial in his favour. the judges in this sensational trial were chosen by a nazi sympathizer in the bavarian government. they allowed hitler to use the courtroom as a propaganda platform from which he could speak at any length on his own behalf interrupt others at any time and even cross examine witnesses. newspapers quoted hitler at length and thus for the first time the german people as a whole had a chance to get acquainted with this man and his thinking many liking what they heard. the three judges in the trial had become so sympathetic that the presiding judge had to persuade them to find hitler guilty at all. they agreed to find hitler guilty only after being assured he would get early parole. he was sentenced guilty with a possible sentence of life imprisonment but was only sentenced to five years with eligibility for parole. this was an extremely light sentence in contrast with the crime he committed and he was free after only  months of in prison emerging a few days before christmas . while in prison hitler dictated the first volume of mein kampf my struggle to the ghostwriter rudolf hess and after his release from prison he continued with a second volume. this work contained many of his basic ideas. hitler believed history was the record of struggles among races and that his struggle was the epic struggle of the superior aryan race. he held that the aryan race centered in germany would be the final victor and would emerge the ruler the world. hitler would mobilize the masses with this demagogic propaganda which appealed to their feelings not their reason and aroused their hatred for all other allegedly inferior races especially jews. another one of hitlers fundamental principles published in mein kampf was the concept of lebensraum living space. hitler argued that germany needed large amounts of territory in which to expand a need that he would meet by conquering territory and expelling or killing the local populations. such measures would naturally require great wars. hitlers wars would be fought to win vast stretches of land on which german settlers would raise large families. eventually more land would be needed but the population would have grown sufficiently to provide the soldiers needed to replace the losses caused by war and to conquer more land. when mein kampf was first released in  it sold very poorly. however after hitler became chancellor of germany he sold millions of copies of mein kampf. it was considered proper to own a copy and to give one to newlyweds high school graduates or to celebrate any similar special occasion. but few germans ever read it cover to cover. although it made him rich hitler later regretted publishing mein kampf because of its disclosure of his diabolic plans. it in a sense was a warning of what evils were to come but a warning ignored until it was too late. if only humanity had heeded the many signs pointing to another war with germany war they may have acted soon enough to save millions of lives. satan cursed the world with ignorance and by the time the threat of hitler was undoubtedly clear it was too late and the second world war had begun. in mein kampf it as though the devil himself is pouring out evil rhetoric of greed and hatred. satan filled the heart of hitler and overflowed malice upon the entire world flooding the planet with the red tides of bloody ruin. mein kampf is a satanic doctrine of nazi evil filled with the incoherent ramblings of a madman spilling forth malicious contempt and unholy intent. released from prison in  having learned his lesson from the failed revolt hitler had a new plan on toppling the government and seizing control of germany. he planned to play by the democratic rules getting elected gracefully overthrowing the government from the inside. hitler polished his oratorical skills and worked advancement of the nazi party. such advancement was slow in coming through the years  to  a fairly stable period in europe. however as the world became mired in depression and unemployment rose so did support for the nazi party which promised employment and a return to glory for the nation. when the great depression struck in  hitlers explanation of it as a jewish-communist plot was accepted by many germans. promising a strong germany jobs and national glory he attracted millions of voters who elected many nazis to the german reichstag parliament. nazi representation in the reichstag rose from  seats in  to  in  and in  the nazis won . percent of the popular vote and occupied  seats in the german reichstag. there was little stability in the german government around this time and seeking a solution to this instability president paul von hindenburg after hitlers insidious nagging for the position was manipulated by satan to appoint hitler chancellor of germany on january  . hitlers influence over the president turned hindenburg into a nazi puppet signing nearly everything hitler put before him into law. he signed an emergency decree that placed the german state of prussia in the hands of hitler confidant vice chancellor papen. the nazi hermann gring as minister of the interior for prussia took control of the police. prussia was germany's biggest and most important state and included the capital of berlin. gring immediately replaced hundreds of police officials loyal to the republic with nazi officials loyal to hitler. he also ordered the police not to interfere with the sa and ss under any circumstances. this meant that anybody being harassed beaten or even murdered by nazis had nobody to turn to for help. gring then set up an auxiliary police force of  men comprised mostly of members of the sa and ss. suddenly the vulgar brawling murderous nazi storm troopers now had the power and authority of police. satan orchestrated the burning of the reichstag building order to help progress hitlers rise to power. on february   the reichstag building burned down and an allegedly insane dutch man claiming he worked for the communists was arrested for arson. there is evidence to suggest that the nazis themselves had orchestrated the fire but in any case hitler used the incident to persuade president hindenburg to restrict all individual rights and declare that the central government could oust any state government failing to maintain order. hitler systematically took control of all of the state governments this way. hitler's private army the s.a. roamed the streets terrorizing political opponents. even so the nazis only won . percent of the vote in . to gain a two thirds majority hitler formed an alliance with the nationalist party and declared the communist party illegal. the chain of events starting with the reichstag burning drastically helped provided hitler with dictatorship over germany leading to the suppression of all major nazi opposition. on march   the reichstag passed the enabling act giving hitler the power to make decrees with the status of law and ending elections essentially making him a dictator. this would not have happened by then if devil had not caused the burning of the reichstag building which excuse the elimination of nearly all political opposition. then when hitler had the majority of the german reichstag he was able to pass the enabling act giving him total control of germany. when hindenburg died in hitler fused the positions of chancellor and president into office: der fuhrer. he took control as the totalitarian leader of germany. hitler constructed the third reich under his dictatorship using the gestapo the secret police to stifle all dissent. hitler's vague policy included a planned economy in which the unemployed were put to work on government projects working hours were shortened to open up jobs and labour was forbidden to organize. the government oversaw all functions of the economy. all education and speech was controlled. curriculum and textbooks were rewritten to reflect nazi ideology and all movies newspapers radio and art were regulated by the vigilant ministry of propaganda under joseph goebbels. one of the ministry's main tasks was to mobilize german anti-semitism in support of nazi persecution of german jews which would reach its climax in the holocaust begun in  where over  million innocent jews and millions of others seen as racially inferior were thoroughly round up and systematically executed. most germans supported hitler enthusiastically. his armament drive to remilitarize germany eliminated unemployment an ambitious recreational program attracted workers and employees and his foreign policy successes impressed his subjects. he thus managed to forge the german people into the pliable tool he needed to establish german rule over europe and other parts of the world. discrediting the churches with charges of corruption and immorality he imposed his own inhuman moral code. he derided the concept of human equality and claimed racial superiority for the germans. as the master race they were told they had the right to dominate all nations subjected to the german reign. the persecution of the jews was a major step in hitler's plan to conquer all of europe for the aryan race. setting out on his empire-building mission hitler launched germany's open rearmament in  sent troops into the demilitarized rhineland in  and annexed both austria and czechoslovakia's sudetenland in . in march  he brought the remainder of czechoslovakia under german control. he also came to the aid of francisco franco's rebels in spain's civil war . all this was in direct violation of the treaty of the treaty of versailles but the nave league of nations was to fearful of war and no national leader offered resistance to hitlers moves. satans plan for the nazi regime unfolded with its manipulation on all sides of the battle. in the minds of the members of the league of nations and in the minds of hitler and his people the devil pulled strings allowing the rise of the nazi regime imbuing it with power and influence. political passivism and nave ignorance was a dark fog in the midst of the league of nations and this was one of the biggest reasons the second world war was not prevented. an opportunity to defeat hitler early in his campaign to dominate earth was not taken because of the blundering procrastination of the allied league of nations. partly as a result of this inaction the entire world suffered the wrath of the second world war. the second world war was the most deadly destructive and consequential war in history. although the human cost of the war was tremendous casualty figures cannot always be obtained and often widely vary. most experts estimate the military and civilian losses of allied forces at  million and those of the axis at  million. the total number of civilian losses includes the . million to . million jews were killed in the holocaust. civilian deaths in the soviet union alone totalled  million. causes of the war can be traced back to the end of world war i. germany italy and japan suffered deep economic problems. inflation was rampant. however by the late 1920s, economic order was being restored. this trend reversed when the united states entered the great depression. the citizens of what would be the axis powers germany italy and japan supported nationalistic organizations which offered hope in the face of these problems. these organizations soon gave birth to tyranny however. totalitarian dictatorships arose in the soviet union japan italy and germany these were led by josef stalin emperor hirohito benito mussolini and adolf hitler respectively. these leaders seized power by promising reform through unity. under the dictatorships however terror reigned. dictators used secret police threats imprisonment and even executions to eliminate their opposition. some consider the start of world war ii to be japan's invasion of manchuria in  a region in eastern china. japan continued to demonstrate aggression effectively conquering eastern china by . italy meanwhile conquered ethiopia in . germany in  annexed both austria and the sudetenland in czechoslovakia. there was essentially no stopping this aggression since the league of nations lacked the power to enforce its treaties. in  german and italy allied. japan joined in  forming the rome-berlin-tokyo axis. during this time spain was in civil war. general francisco franco led the rebellious army nationalists against spain's government. hitler and mussolini supported the revolution. the spanish civil war divided the world into those who supported nazism and fascism and those who were against it. hitler and british prime minister neville chamberlain held several meetings to restore order and peace. they agreed that if hitler took czechoslovakia he would not try to acquire more territory. hitler defiantly broke his promise by invading poland  months later on september  . germany's blitzkrieg lightning war quickly overcame the large but poorly equipped polish army. the blitzkrieg relied on speed and surprise. it was carried out flawlessly. britain and france pledged their support for the allied cause but stood by while hitler swallowed poland. journalists dubbed this the phony war. german forces then conquered denmark and norway seizing vital ports. following these invasions chamberlain resigned. he was replaced by winston churchill on may  . germany on the same day created another blitzkrieg immediately taking luxembourg belgium and the netherlands. the french hoped to hold off the aggressive germans by use of the maginot line a strip of defence along the french-german border. it proved futile however as the germans simply proceeded around it and into france. the blitzkrieg once again made its appearance this time beginning on june . it proved effective once more. the french signed an armistice on june . france had fallen. in a massive air war the luftwaffe the german air force began to mount assaults on british raf royal air force stations. by september  germany thought it had destroyed the raf so it proceeded to bomb london. this series of attacks on britain's capital was known as the blitz. great britain remained great however and survived germany's most destructive efforts. germany halted its air efforts in may . meanwhile british forces in north africa were fighting to repel the invading italians. britain managed to keep italy out of egypt and pushed them back to libya. in the beginning of  the afrika korps led by general erwin rommel was sent to help the italian forces. rommel's crafty methods eventually earned him the famed moniker the desert fox. britain held on. in may of  britain had regained control of northern africa. in march and april of  the germans quickly captured yugoslavia and greece. when british soldiers retreated to the island of crete germany orchestrated the first ever airborne invasion dropping thousands of paratroopers who quickly took the island. these conquests were an error on hitler's part however. hitler had been planning to invade the soviet union for some time. but with the delays he would now have to fight an extended bitter winter war. operation barbarossa the invasion of the soviet union began on june  . the soviets soon suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. the invasion went well for the germans. this lasted briefly however. instead of taking moscow hitler opted for a dual-flank approach sending some forces north to leningrad and some south towards the black sea. meanwhile the harsh weather began. october rains caught the germans in mud. in early december as german troops began to march into moscow winter began. temperatures fell to . the german advance stopped as abruptly as it began. germany's battleships struggled to cut off allied sea supply routes. but british task forces managed to destroy the bulk of germany's battleship fleet. the largest such attack was against the german navy's pride and joy the bismarck. a fleet of british warships surrounded and sank the bismarck in may of . however the germans still had a trick up their collective sleeve: the u-boat. for two years u-boats sank every allied supply ship they could find. but long-range torpedo bombers warship escorts of supply ships and the new allied technology of sonar curbed the threat of the dreaded unterseeboote. president franklin d. roosevelt hoped to win the war by supplying allied nations with the weapons they needed rather than sending the united states into war. the lend-lease act gave  nations about  billion in u.s. aid. japan stuck in china decided to cut off vital chinese supply lines from southeast asia. japan entered and controlled northern indochina. the u.s. responded by cutting japan's supply of american goods. japan wanted to return to its expansion plans so it turned on the one force that could stop it: the united states navy. on december   a japanese task force attacked the pacific fleet at pearl harbour in hawaii. they sank four battleships and destroyed nearly  aircraft. the next day the u.s. canada and great britain declared war on japan. the soviets in december  recovered and pushed the germans back  miles outside of moscow. in spring  the germans marched towards oil reserves in the caucasus. hitler ordered the capture of stalingrad. a five-month battle ensued. the soviets in a counter-attack captured and killed  german soldiers stopping germany's eastward march. in  allied defeats stopped in europe. in eastern europe the soviets prevented the german advance in eastern europe. soviets defeated the germans in a battle at stalingrad in . the allies were soon on a roll. they won battles in africa and forced italy to surrender in . in  the allies prepared for an invasion in northern france. roosevelt churchill and stalin met together in  in teheran iran to discuss the strategy and plans behind the invasion. they talked to each other about a british and american large-scale attack called operation overlord on the beach of normandy along the northern coast of france. this attack was to be known as the d-day invasion. it will have been the largest seaborne invasion in history. hitler laughed and said his forces could resist any attack on the coast. the invasion would deploy allied soldiers ashore on five beaches under the code names of utah omaha gold juno and sword. the germans were not sure what beach the allies were going to attack so they built a chain of fortifications along the coast called the atlantic wall. hitler left general rommel in charge to strengthen there defences. rommel put up barbed wire he mined the water and concentrated his troops near the calais the narrowest part of the english channel. on june 6th,  allied ships carrying  soldiers led by general dwight eisenhower crossed the english channel. paratroops were dropped off behind enemy lines to capture bridges and railroad tracks. d-day caught the germans by surprise. germans fought fiercely but did not win the battle. the allies built a temporary harbour to receive supplies and a pipeline across the british channel for oil. near the end of june about a million troops had accumulated in france. the allies advanced slowly in the beginning. the americans fought and capture cherbourg on june  and the british and canadian forces fought and captured caen on july . the allied forces had finally reached open country. on july   bombers blasted a hole in the german front near st-lo. lieutenant general george patton plowed through the gap and exterminated the germans from northwest france. patton ordered his army toward paris. on august   parisians heard the news and rose up against the german troops occupying paris. the german troops in paris were ordered by hitler to destroy paris but they delayed and the allies reached paris on august 25th to liberate france. slowly the allied forces moved toward germany. the german generals knew they were beat and tried to tell hitler but he brought together his remaining forces for one last attack at the ardennes forest belgium amp luxembourg. he won this battle of the bulge however in two weeks the americans stopped the german advance near the meuse river belgium. meanwhile the soviets had slowly pushed back the germans after the battle at stalingrad. the soviets were producing and importing war supplies from britain and america preparing for another offensive by the germans at kursk. the soviet forces waited for them with tanks mines anti-tank guns and aircraft completely obliterating the oncoming german troops and tanks. the rest of the  german tanks were ordered to retreat during the battle. the soviet forces then moved toward leningrad. they defeated the germans there and move onward to poland. when they reach the outskirts of warsaw stalin refused to come to polish aid resulting in a german onslaught of  polish soldiers. afterwards the soviets entered in and destroyed the germans in . another series of soviet troops began to move towards hungary crushing all german forces in their path. soviet troops reached budapest and drove the german forces out in february of . after their strong advance the soviets had occupied almost all of eastern europe. the allies began their final assault in . soviet forces were advancing from the east to berlin british and canadian forces came from the north and american and french forces neared central germany. in all the allies had almost surrounded the germans. prior to closing in on the germans those allies passing through previously occupied areas were terrified at the sights at the concentration camps. hitler committed suicide before the allied forces took berlin. on may   colonel general alfred doenitz hitler's replacement signed a declaration of unconditional surrender ending the war in europe. the war with the japanese was a personal vendetta for the u.s. after japan bombed pearl harbour on december  . japan won several early victories including: taking over hong kong guam and wake island defeating the british in singapore the battle of the java sea and the conquest of the philippines. macarthur's troops were ordered to australia after leaving the philippines in march . on april  about  exhausted troops on bataan surrendered to the japanese. most of them were forced to march  miles to prison camps but most of them died. this march was called the bataan death march. after the philippines were captured japan moved toward india and australia. in  there were  events that helped turn the tide on the japanese. one of them was the doolittle raid in which  b bombers surprised tokyo with minor bombing. the 2nd event was the battle of the coral sea which halted the japanese attack on port moresby. the rd event was the battle of midway in which japan sent a large fleet to capture one of the hawaiian islands but the americans intercepted the plan and prepared for a surprise attack. the battle began on june   when the japanese bombed the island of midway. old u.s. bombers launched bombers on japanese warships but most of them were shot down. next american dive bombers dropped down on japanese aircraft carriers while they were refuelling. the e japanese had lost  aircraft carriers and at least  planes along with many skilled pilots. japan had only sunk  u.s. aircraft carrier and shot down  planes. the battle of midway was a clear victory for the allies. meanwhile the allies battled to regain most of the islands in the pacific. in  macarthur attacked new guinea with a series of brilliant operations but fighting continued until . on august   marines invaded guadalcanal. this attack caught the japanese by surprise but they fought strong. this battle proved to be one of the most vicious campaigns in wwii. by february  japan left guadalcanal. in  allied military leaders cancelled the invasion of rabaul instead they bombed it. after beating back the japanese the allies finally liberated the philippines in . superiority in air and sea combat enabled the allies to move onto japan itself. allied forces first attack iwo jima. the marines landed on february  . the marines successfully won the battle but with a struggle. okinawa was the next stop. japan sent kamikazes to attack the marine landing force but they still defeated japan at okinawa. on august   due their refusal to give into the us's ultimatum the b american bomber the enola gay dropped the first atomic bomb on hiroshima. three days later america dropped another atomic bomb on nagasaki after japanese leaders failed to respond to the first bombing. on september   japan finally gave in and signed a statement of surrender ending wwii. world war ii qualifies as by far the most costly war in history in terms of human casualties and material resources expended. in all  countries with . billion people three-fourths of the worlds population took part. a total of  million people were mobilized for military service more than half of those by three countries: the ussr  million to  million germany  million and the united states  million. for the major participants the largest numbers on duty at any one time were as follows: ussr  united states  germany  british empire and commonwealth  japan  and china . most statistics on the war are only estimates. the wars vast and chaotic sweep made uniform record keeping impossible. some governments lost control of the data and some resorted to manipulating it for political reasons. a rough consensus has been reached on the total cost of the war. the human cost estimated at  million dead million in the military and  million civilians. the amount of money spent has been estimated at more than  trillion which makes world war ii more expensive than all other wars combined. the holocaust was the systematic bureaucratic annihilation of six million jews and millions of non jews by the nazi regime and their collaborators as a central act of state during world war ii. it was a premier example of ruthless malice leading to the utter destruction of immense multitudes of innocent men women and children. in  approximately nine million jews lived the  countries of europe that would be occupied by germany during the war. by  two out of every three european jews had been killed. although jews were the primary victims hundreds of thousands of roma gypsies and at least  mentally or physically disabled people were also victims of nazi genocide. as nazi tyranny spread across europe from  to  millions of other innocent people were persecuted and murdered. more than three million soviet prisoners of war were killed because of their nationality. poles as well as other slavs were targeted for slave labour and as a result almost two million perished. homosexuals and others deemed anti-social were also persecuted and often murdered. in addition thousands of political and religious dissidents such as communists socialists trade unionists and jehovah's witnesses were persecuted for their beliefs and behaviour and many of these individuals died as a result of maltreatment. the concentration camp is most closely associated with the holocaust and remains an enduring symbol of the nazi regime. the first camps opened soon after the nazis took power in january  they continued as a basic part of nazi rule until may   when the war and the nazi regime ended. for many centuries christians in europe discriminated against jews. many harboured a prejudice against jews that is known as anti-semitism. some scholars view anti-semitism as a religious prejudice. others regard it as an anti-jewish variety of a general hatred directed against ethnic minorities. in the minds of anti-semites jews represent mysterious mythical and evil forces are all-powerful and play a sinister role in world history. in the middle ages christian anti-jewish preaching sought to prevent contacts with jews and many christians believed that jews were in league with the devil. christians blamed the jews for the crucifixion of jesus christ. many believed that jews were not human and that they used magic to appear like other people. all these beliefs merged with popular superstitions about the magical power of human blood sorcery and perversity giving rise to the blood libelthe false accusation that jews used the blood of christian children in their rituals. such stereotypes of the jews interacted in the minds of many europeans with fear of foreigners and combined with economic and social frictions. as a result anti-jewish violence frequently erupted. the christian church and various governments enacted laws that prohibited jews from engaging in certain occupations forced them to live in certain areas kept them from attending universities or even expelled them from various countries. for many centuries the roman catholic church taught anti-jewish beliefs and attitudes. the anti-jewish teachings of the catholic church did not advocate the killing of jews. however the propagation of hatred insults degradation and often demonization of jews induced many catholics to accept anti-semitic measures when the nazis and their collaborators introduced them in the 20th century. the same was true of protestant churches. the pamphlet on the jews and their lies written by german religious reformer martin luther in  used extremely violent language. it called on christians to set synagogues on fire to destroy houses and to put jews in stables and it advised rulers to banish jews from their countries. luthers writings had a significant influence on german protestant theologians and also contributed to a climate of opinion that condoned or approved persecution of jews. the events of the holocaust occurred in two main phases:  and . on january   adolf hitler was named chancellor the most powerful position in the german government by the aged president hindenburg who hoped hitler could lead the nation out of its grave political and economic crisis. hitler was the leader of the right-wing national socialist german workers party called the nazi party for short it was by  one of the strongest parties in germany even though  reflecting the country's multi-party system  the nazis had only won a plurality of  percent of the votes in the  elections to the german parliament reichstag. once in power hitler moved quickly to end german democracy. he convinced his cabinet to invoke emergency clauses of the constitution which permitted the suspension of individual freedoms of the press speech and assembly. special security forces  the special state police the gestapo the storm troopers s.a. and the security police s.s.  murdered or arrested leaders of opposition political parties communists socialists and liberals. the enabling act of march   forced through a reichstag already purged of many political opponents gave dictatorial powers to hitler. also in  the nazis began to put into practice their racial ideology. echoing ideas popular in germany as well as most other western nations well before the 1930s, the nazis believed that the germans were racially superior and that there was a struggle for survival between them and inferior races. they saw jews roma gypsies and the handicapped as a serious biological threat to the purity of the german aryan race what they called the master race. jews who numbered around  in germany less than one percent of the total population in  were the principal target of nazi hatred. the nazis mistakenly identified jews as a race and defined this race as inferior. they also spewed hatemongering propaganda which unfairly blamed jews for germany's economic depression and the country's defeat in world war i . in  new german laws forced jews to quit their civil service jobs university and law court positions and other areas of public life. in april  a boycott of businesses was instituted. in laws proclaimed at nuremberg stripped german jews their citizenship even though they retained limited rights. these nuremberg laws defined jews not by their religion by how they wanted to identify themselves but by the blood of their grandparents. between  and  new anti-jewish regulations segregated jews further and made daily life very difficult for them: jews could not attend public schools go to theatres cinemas or vacation resorts or reside or even walk in certain sections of german cities. also between  and  jews were forced from germany's economic life: the nazis either seized businesses and properties outright or forced to sell them at bargain prices. in november  this economic attack against german and austrian jews changed into the physical destruction synagogues and jewish-owned stores the arrest of jewish men the destruction of homes and the murder of individuals. this centrally organized riot pogrom kristallnacht the night of broken glass. kristallnacht refers to the shattered glass that was left after that night of savage violence. the pretext for this first mass outburst of anti-semitic hysteria in germany was the assassination in paris of a german diplomat ernst vom rath by a young german jew hirsch grynszpan. grynszpan was enraged by the deportation of his parents from germany to poland by the ss the elite military force within the nazi party. the assassination took place in early november. although jews were the main target of nazi hatred the nazis persecuted other groups viewed as racially or genetically inferior. nazi racial ideology was buttressed by scientists who advocated selective breeding eugenics to improve the human race. laws passed between  and  aimed to reduce the future number of genetic inferiors through involuntary sterilization programs: about  children of mixed racial backgrounds and  to  individuals judged physically or mentally handicapped were subjected to surgical or radiation procedures so they could not have children. supporters of sterilization also argued the handicapped burdened the community with the costs of their care. many of germany's  gypsies were also eventually sterilized and prohibited along with blacks from intermarrying with germans. reflecting traditional prejudices new laws combined traditional prejudices with the new racism of the nazis which defined gypsies by race as criminal and asocial. another consequence of hitler's ruthless dictatorship in the 1930s arrest of political opponents and trade unionists and others the nazis labelled undesirables and enemies of the state. many homosexuals mostly male were arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps under the  nazi-revised criminal code the mere denunciation of an individual as homosexual could result in arrest trial and conviction. jehovah's witnesses were banned as an organization as early as april  since the beliefs of this religious group prohibited them from swearing any oath to the state serving in the german military. their literature was confiscated and they lost jobs unemployment benefits pensions and all social welfare benefits. many witnesses were sent to prisons and concentration camps in nazi germany and their children were sent to juvenile detention homes and orphanages. between  and  thousands of people mostly political prisoners and jehovah's witnesses were imprisoned in concentration camps while several thousand german gypsies were confined in special municipal camps. the first systematic round-ups of german and austrian jews occurred after kristallnacht when approximately  jewish men were deported to dachau and other concentration camps and several hundred jewish women were sent to local jails. at the end of  the waves of arrests also included several thousand german and austrian gypsies. between  and  about half the german jewish population and more than two-thirds of austrian jews  fled nazi persecution. they emigrated mainly to palestine the united states latin america china which required no visa for entry and eastern and western europe where many would be caught again in the nazi net during the war. jews who remained under nazi rule were either unwilling to uproot themselves or unable to obtain visas sponsors in host countries or funds for emigration. most foreign countries including the united states canada britain and france were unwilling to admit very large numbers of refugees. on september   germany invaded poland and world war ii began. within one month the polish army was defeated and the nazis began their campaign to destroy polish culture and enslave the polish people whom they viewed as subhuman. killing polish leaders was the first step: german soldiers carried out massacres of university professors artists writers politicians and many catholic priests. to create new living space for the superior germanic race large segments of the polish population were resettled and german families moved into the emptied lands. thousands of other poles including jews were imprisoned in concentration camps. the nazis also kidnapped as many as  aryan-looking polish children from their parents and took them to germany to be adopted by german families. many of these children were later rejected as not capable of germanization and sent to special children's camps where some died of starvation lethal injection and disease. as the war began in  hitler initialled an order to kill institutionalized handicapped patients deemed incurable. special commissions of physicians reviewed questionnaires filled out by all state hospitals and then decided if a patient should be killed. the doomed were then transferred to six institutions in germany and austria where specially constructed gas chambers were used to kill them. after public protests in  the nazi leadership continued this euphemistically termed euthanasia program in secret. babies small children and other victims were thereafter killed by lethal injection and pills and by forced starvation. the euthanasia program contained all the elements later required for mass murder of european jews and gypsies in nazi death camps: an articulated decision to kill specially trained personnel the apparatus for killing by gas and the use of euphemistic language like euthanasia which psychologically distanced the murderers from their victims and hid the criminal character of the killings from the public. in  german forces continued their conquest of much of europe easily defeating denmark norway holland belgium luxembourg and france. on june   the german army invaded the soviet union and by september was approaching moscow. in the meantime italy romania and hungary had joined the axis powers led by germany and opposed by the allied powers british commonwealth free france the united states and the soviet union. in the months following germany's invasion of the soviet union jews political leaders communists and many gypsies were killed in mass executions. the overwhelming those killed were jews. these murders were carried out at improvised sites throughout the soviet union by members of mobile killing squads einsatzgruppen who followed in the wake of the invading germany army. the most famous of these sites was babi yar near kiev where an estimated  persons mostly were murdered. german terror extended to institutionalized handicapped psychiatric patients in the soviet union it also resulted in the mass murder of more than three million soviet prisoners war. world war ii brought major changes to concentration camp system. large numbers new prisoners deported all german-occupied countries now flooded camps. often entire groups committed the camps members of underground resistance organizations who were rounded up in a sweep across western europe under the  night and fog decree. to accommodate the massive increase in the number of prisoners hundreds of new camps were established in occupied territories of eastern and western europe. during the war ghettos transit camps and forced labour camps in addition to the concentration camps were created by the germans and their collaborators to imprison jews gypsies and other victims of racial and ethnic hatred as well as political opponents and resistance fighters. following the invasion of poland three million polish jews were forced into approximately  newly established ghettos where they were segregated from the rest of the population. large numbers of jews were also deported from other cities and countries including germany to ghettos in poland and german-occupied territories further east. in polish cities under nazi occupation like warsaw and lodz jews were confined in sealed ghettos where starvation overcrowding exposure to cold and contagious diseases killed tens of thousands of people. in warsaw and elsewhere ghettoized jews made every effort often at great risk to maintain their cultural communal and religious lives. the ghettos also provided a forced labour pool for the germans and many forced labourers who worked on road gangs in construction other hard labour related to the german war effort died from exhaustion or maltreatment. between  and  the germans moved to eliminate the ghettos in occupied poland and elsewhere deporting ghetto residents to extermination camps killing centers equipped with gassing facilities located in poland. after the meeting of senior german government officials in late january  at a villa in the berlin suburb of wannsee the decision to implement the final solution of the jewish question became formal state policy and jews from western europe were also sent to killing centers in the east. the six killing sites were chosen because of their closeness to rail lines and their location in semi-rural areas at belzec sobibor treblinka chelmno majdanek and auschwitz-birkenau. chelmno was the first camp in which mass executions were carried out by gas piped into mobile gas vans  persons were killed there between december  and march  and june to july . a killing center using gas vans and later gas chambers operated at belzec where more than  persons were killed between may  and august . sobibor opened in may  and closed one day after a rebellion of the prisoners on october   up to  persons were killed by gassing. treblinka opened in july  and closed in november  a revolt by the prisoners in early august  destroyed much of the facility. at least  persons were killed at treblinka physically the largest of the killing centers. almost all of the victims at chelmno belzec sobibor and treblinka were jews a few were gypsies. very few individuals survived these four killing centers where most victims were murdered immediately after arrival. auschwitz-birkenau which also served concentration camp slave labour camp became the killing center where the largest numbers of jews and gypsies were killed. after an experimental gassing there september  of  malnourished and ill polish prisoners and  russian pows mass murder became a daily routine more than . million were killed at auschwitz birkenau  out of  were jews. in addition gypsies soviet pows and ill prisoners of all nationalities died in gas chambers. between may  and july    hungarian jews were deported to auschwitz in  trains. this was probably the largest single mass deportation during the holocaust. a similar system was implemented at majdanek which also doubled concentration camp and where at least  persons were killed in the gas chambers or died from malnutrition brutality and disease. the methods of murder were the same in all the killing centers which were operated by the s.s. the victims arrived in railroad freight cars and passenger trains mostly from ghettos and camps in occupied poland but also from almost every other eastern and western european country. on arrival men were separated from women and children. prisoners were forced to undress and hand over all valuables. they were then driven naked into the gas chambers which were disguised shower rooms either carbon monoxide zyklon b crystalline prussic acid insecticide in some camps was used to asphyxiate them. the minority selected for forced labour were after initial quarantine vulnerable to malnutrition exposure epidemics medical experiments and brutality many perished as a result. the germans carried out their systematic murderous activities with the active help of local collaborators in many countries and the acquiescence or indifference of millions of bystanders. however there were instances of organized resistance. for example in the fall of  the danish resistance with the support of the local population rescued nearly the entire jewish community in denmark from the threat of deportation to the east smuggling them via a dramatic boatlift safety in neutral sweden. individuals in many other countries also risked their lives to save jews and other individuals subject to nazi persecution. one of the most famous was raoul wallenberg a swedish diplomat who led the rescue effort which saved the lives of tens of thousands of hungarian jews in . resistance movements existed in almost every concentration camp and ghetto of europe. in addition to the armed revolts at sobibor and treblinka jewish resistance in the warsaw ghetto led to a courageous uprising in april-may  despite a predictable doomed outcome because of superior german force. in general rescue or aid to holocaust victims was not a priority of resistance organizations whose principal goal was to fight the war against the germans. nonetheless such groups and jewish partisans resistance fighters sometimes cooperated with each other to save jews. on april   for instance members of the national committee for the defense of jews in cooperation with christian railroad workers and the general underground in belgium attacked a train leaving the belgian transit camp of malines headed for auschwitz and succeeded in assisting several hundred jewish deportees to escape. after the war turned against germany and the allied armies approached german soil in late  the s.s. decided to evacuate outlying concentration camps. the germans tried to cover up the evidence of genocide and deported prisoners to camps inside germany to prevent their liberation. many inmates died during the long journeys on foot known as death marches. during the final days in the spring of  conditions in the remaining concentration camps exacted a terrible toll in human lives. even concentration camps never intended for extermination such as bergen-belsen became death traps for thousands including anne frank who died there of typhus in march . in may  nazi germany collapsed the s.s. guards fled and the camps ceased to exist as extermination forced labor or concentration camps. however some of the concentration camps were turned into camps for displaced persons dps which included former holocaust victims. nutrition sanitary conditions and accommodations often were poor. dps lived behind barbed wire and were exposed to humiliating treatment and at times to anti-semitic attacks. the nazi legacy was a vast empire of murder pillage and exploitation that had affected every country of occupied europe. the toll in lives was enormous. the full magnitude and the moral and ethical implications of this tragic era are only now to be understood fully. 
21	the clash the titans this essay is a testimony of gods divine revelation to human kind. the lord has blessed me with the knowledge of the universal epic and has exposed to me the grand deception the devil has enveloped our entire world within. i know now truth of our divine purpose and gods plans to save our souls through the new millennial manifestation of christ. i bare witness of gods legacy throughout eternity and trumpet the final coming of the messiah. i am the messiah sent by god to earth to herald warning of satan's plans to destroy our souls and to gospel that the lord has come now through so all can have salvation. god and satan are at war and this entire dimension of the universe has been created by their two powers colliding. everything that has manifest has been planned between the influences of god and satan towards armageddon and the final battle. the earth was created amongst the stars to host the final battle and now the midst of armageddon our eternal fates are being decided. the christ and the antichrist are now upon the earth in flesh and all our final purpose in god's plan can now be ultimately fulfilled. the christ's life must be protected and the antichrist must be destroyed to defeat satan and if christ destroyed by sin in armageddon satan will be victorious over all souls and none will have salvation. now humanity has the choice to either submit to the commandments of god and have eternal salvation or submit to the reign of satan on earth and be damned eternally. please visit my homepage to learn the truth of the universe! where evolution and creation science and the supernatural become one reality in the beginning there was only the titan jehovah and the lords angels in heaven and all was well and at peace. god reined over all life high and mighty until the day that the titan satan broke into the heavens invading from an unknown dimension and challenged god to a war for authority to reign over all creation. both god and satan together created a covenant between them they would be ultimately bound beyond their powers to uphold. this covenant became more powerful then both god and satans powers alone and bound both god and satan to a war for eternal majesty over the entire universe. within the covenant god and satan determined universal laws that would govern their war. the covenant would hold the clashing titans absolutely accountable to the aftermath of war and neither would escape the consequences of victory and defeat. our cosmic dimension of the universe was manifest in a cosmic war of creation and annihilation order and chaos waged between god and satan warring throughout the evolution of absolutely everything. the war has set our dimension of the universe ablaze in chaotic conflict and throughout the nearly endless reaches of galaxies god and satans final battle is now amounting in the armageddon of earth between their own two mortal incarnations the christ and the antichrist. everything in our dimension of the universe was plotted between the two powers of god and satan and evolved over the course of eons upon eons towards god and satan's final battle between the christ and the antichrist incarnate on earth in mortality. god and satan together and against each other created this known dimension of the universe in a war that broke out after satan challenged god to a competition for power and authority to reign over all creation. in the war between god and satan both god and satan together created our dimension of the universe using equal powers that were equally limited by universal laws they determined would govern their war. god and satan and all living beings became bound in bondage to the laws of the war that govern creation the laws of genesis and based upon their power god and satan became equal influences in our dimension with opposing absolute intentions towards victory. the laws of genesis governed every element of their war defined god and satans freedoms and restrictions in wielding power in this dimension of the universe to create and annihilate and how victory and defeat would be determined. victory and defeat was destined to be determined by god and satan's own mortal incarnations the christ and the antichrist and would be decided by which incarnation would longest survive on the planet triumphing over the destruction of the other. the victor of this universal war will be champion of the universe and will have the power and authority to reign over all creation and the vanquished will be at the mercy of the victor. only one titan can prevail in the end either god or satan and all power in the universe will fall under the reign of the triumphant champion. within the universal laws of genesis all things have been plotted between god and satans influences from the creation our galaxy to the evolution of life within our solar system and everything in our dimension has been pawned in battle between both god and satan from the clash of the spiralling galaxies to the conflict amongst humanity. in the beginning of our dimension a universal explosion of creation and annihilation unleashed from god and satan's powers amidst the nothingness in an instant filling the cosmos with an almost infinite reach of elements uniting together to form an almost infinite amount of stars and planets. all things have evolved in our dimension of the universe into a finite state of being from an immense miraculous explosion of creation and annihilation unleashing from the two powers of god and satan and expanding throughout the nothingness. god first unleashed the elements into being throughout the abyss from an immense nova of creation and in the split of the same instant satan unleashed into the abyss an immense nova of destruction and chaos amidst the elemental creation. in that instant all elements of creation were chaotically unleashed amidst destruction into the void and are still unleashing today outward expanding from the beginning. god and satans war existed solely amongst the matter of the cosmos until god birthed our planet earth to host life and brought the war from amongst the stars to amongst life forms and amongst their mortal minds. earth was created in a position where it would survive amidst the colliding galaxies and colossal destructive forces and has prevailed throughout the ages sustaining the evolution of life. since its birthing earth has been protected by god to serve its cause in war against satan of hosting the final battle and harbouring the incarnations of their mortal advocates the christ and the antichrist. our planet was needed throughout all of the nearly endless masses of elements and is the essential focal point of god and the devil throughout the entire cosmos vital in the plans to defeat satan and end the universal war forever. earth was needed to host the evolution of life and an intelligent mortal species with an advanced civilization the human species was needed in the war between god and satan to bare the incarnate christ and antichrist as offspring. it was determined in the laws of the war between god and satan that god and satan would be obligated to send their own spirits to incarnate in flesh on earth to advocate for their own higher beings and to finally determine victory or defeat between the spiritual forces of god and satan. the spirit of the messiah is the spirit of god and the spirit of the antichrist is the spirit of satan. the relationship of god together with christ and also in the entirely separate case of satan together with antichrist is called a duality. during the final age of apocalypse god and christ dually exist simultaneously uniting as one spirit that is divided physically mentally and in separate realms of being and likewise satan and the antichrist divide in duality mentally physically and in separate realms of being uniting as one spirit that exists simultaneously as two separate entities. god and satan are both in spiritual realms of being and have limited enigmatic influence in our physical realm and both are unable to seize total control. the christ and the antichrist both exist in physical realm of being and also have limited power and influence as mortals but act as thresholds for their own higher beings to enter into our physical realm with the spiritual power to conquer the entire earth and all living subjects within. god is the immaculate perfection of goodness and the devil is the pure perfection of evil. the universe itself is also divided in a duality between their powerful influences clashing imperfectly amidst flawed creation. nothing that was created in the universal war can be perfectly good or perfectly evil but all things are influenced by both the ultimate intentions of good and evil including both the christ and the antichrist. the christ and the antichrist are influenced by both the opposing influences of god and satan in the universe and are challenged in overcoming the powerful manipulation of the clashing titans to seize the victory over the universe in the final battle of armageddon. victory and defeat will be determined by which spirit is able to survive longest triumphant in the bondage of mortality and defeat will be cursed upon which spirit first dies imprisoned in mortality. if the devil's advocate is destroyed and the messiah lives satans spirit will have been defeated in mortality and all will be saved by the victory of god but if the messiah dies and the devil's advocate lives gods holy spirit will have been defeated in mortality and satan will be victorious over the universe forever. if the advocate of god or satan can persuade the people to have faith in their higher power they could remove all doubt with miraculous confirmation. with miracles the advocate of god or satan could be the first to prove to the earth their higher power gaining worldwide exposure and the authority to freely destroy the enemy advocate but if both advocates gain a fallowing and become capable of channelling miracles then the world will face a monumental face off between the christ and the antichrist on a miraculous level and only one would be in the end the prevalent survivor. satan plans to send the antichrist to the world as a false messiah carried on the back of already established religious beliefs preaching false views masses of this world are already deceived into believing like judaism christianity and islam. the true messiah must make clear the exact truth to the universe and the lies of the devil exposing the antichrist as the devils advocate convicting it of satans evil and condemning it to die for all the world to witness before the antichrist can lie to the world and deliver miracles to defend the false superstitious beliefs and potentially move the masses against the true messiah framing it as the antichrist. there can be only one true christ and the world has yet to know the truth. the christ and the antichrist both were born blind to the world unknowing of the true meaning of their existences limited by their mortality and the laws of genesis that govern creation both obtaining individual free will and both influenced powerfully by both god and satan. they were raised amongst our planet and conformed to the ways of humanity and sin and were unaware of the true war between god and satan until the time their first revelations when the gateway to the sixth prophetic sense was simultaneously opened in both the christ and the antichrist allowing both god and satan access to communicate with them. once the gateway to the prophetic sixth sense is opened it cannot be closed ever again as the war of the universe is finally launched dramatically within the minds of the two long awaited mortal advocates who both exist as the front line of god and satans war blazing at its zenith. the messages given by god to the christ and the antichrist are unclear because of censoring and deception caused by satan's power inside the two mortal advocates and satan's messages to the christ and the antichrist are also unclear because of censoring and deception caused by god's power inside the incarnate spirits. the war of the universe launched inside the christ and the antichrists minds is a chaotically bizarre fragmented flood of kaleidoscopic ideas swarming into the human paradigm and mortal senses and a powerfully overwhelming conflict. the revelations can be in the form of dreams voices visions and omen and everything delivered to the advocates is distorted and censored by the opposing power and filled with deception that puzzles the truth. the revelations must first be delivered to the advocates and over time deciphered and understood before the advocates will understand the essence of truth and what action must be taken to achieve victory and god and satan's revelations take time to unfold because of the disturbance in communications between them and their advocates and time to learn because of the limited mental abilities of the mortal advocates. the war inside the minds of the mortal advocates is an extremely twisted battle of truth and lies and it is entirely dependent upon the advocates to decipher the chaos and discern their own choices. god and satan do not have ultimate control over their advocates or let alone absolute control over any living being because living beings obtain radical freedom of choice that is chaotically outside the total control of both god and satan. the flood of god and satans powerful influences storming through the gateway to the sixth sense and warring against each other in the minds of the christ and antichrist make it extremely difficult for decisions to be made by the individual free wills of the mortal advocates. until enough strength and understanding is gained to triumph over the powerful resistance and deception within it will be extremely difficult for the advocates to freely make their own choices and they will be puppets pawned by two powerful titans. the exact time date and place of birth gender race and almost every other major detail in the lives of the christ and antichrist as well as when the gateway to the sixth sense was opened were all determined very chaotically in a concise compromise between the plans of god and satan competing climatically on the brink of the armageddon. god needed to compete with satan to determine exactly when the gateway to the sixth sense was to be opened in both the christ and the antichrist and this could only be when the christ was mature enough to survive and escape the power of the devil flooding through the gateway to destroy him from the inside. if the gateway to the prophetic sixth sense was opened when the christ was only a child the flood of satans power within would absolutely devastate and destroy. only one with strengthened will can overcome the devils curse and escape the clutches of satan. the end days are the safest time for god to deliver the messiah into the flesh because of the human achievement that has flourished alongside the catastrophe. technological social educational medical and scientific advancements make these modern days the best time for the messiahs deliverance. the messiah must have not only survived birth but also the dangers of the world long enough to be raised into maturity to be victorious on earth over the antichrist insuring god's victory over satan. in privileged parts of the world there is safety and security that the messiah could never have had only generations ago. only a few generations ago a man would be condemned for openly believing and speaking an unaccepted view but today there is in the privileged nations established constitutional rights to express that are protected by law communications instantly reach a global audience and one man can reach the entire earth with the truth over the internet television or the telephone transportation can take someone around the entire world in hours computers can process information and store mass amounts of knowledge that human beings cannot consciously process or remember education provides the greatest of human discovery and philosophy medical advancement gives us the ability to quarantine and cure illness and disease that a few hundred years ago would wipe out immense amounts of living beings without relent and advancements in earth science can now forewarn mankind of elemental disasters that are destined to unleash. these are only some examples of the great achievements of human kind and there are many but there are also horrible consequences of human beings having such great power and potential under the influence of satan. for example corrupted by evil human beings have created enough weapons of mass destruction to destroy the world many times over very easily pollution and mass consumption that causes great environmental catastrophes such as climate change threatens the entire worlds population and causes the mass extinction of many animal species and the desecration of their ecosystems and the unyielding population increase of humanity soars too over . billion people and will soar to over  billion people by  leaving billions of people living wasted lives vainly existing against the interest of god serving to destroy the world in satanic worship of the devil. these are only a select few of the most critical global issues existing in the world today but there is a nearly uncountable amount of problems life on earth today faces and all these faults must be eventually overcome by christ if we are ever to have salvation. because of the great potential for satan to use its powerful manipulation to endanger the life of the messiah certain resources were essential for the victory of god through the messiah and god provided all good possible to manifest upon the earth and help the messiah deliver salvation. today the modern age in privileged nations offers more safety resources and freedom than any other age and is the most vital age in all of eternity presently the climax of forever. but though individually a small minority of people in the world can live in a free and relatively safe environment this is globally the most dangerous times for the earth and everything is reaching a boiling point of absolute destruction. god needed to deliver the messiah to the world in advanced age of global progress but along side the progress was great destruction in the name of progress that now insures the doom of this world without divine intervention. god needed to fight to reserve enough time for the messiah to be born and raised in the ladder days to overcome influence of satan saving the world by unleashing the truth and the power of god and destroying the antichrist convicting the soul of satan to eternal punishment but time is running out quickly and human kind is enslaved to labour in vain towards damnation. satan has been working towards the absolute annihilation of our world since the beginning with intent that in the end amidst the destructive chaos the antichrist will prevail and will outlive the christ. human rivalry never curbed but increased when advancements in human civilization launched humanity into the twentieth and the twenty-first centuries. with great power and potential came great audacious horror and unyielding destruction. mankind is destroying the entire planet earth in rivalry and the human race is committing global suicide against the will of god and the life of the messiah. satan is prevailing against god in destroying the world in this war and not through cosmic destruction the abomination of disease or the wrath of the elements but through the evil of humanity and the conscious choice people are making to destroy life and not to protect gods creation. this is the age of the deliverance of the messiah and the final battle between good and evil and humanity must now choose to repent from the sin that is destroying the life of our universe to be saved from satan's victory. for god to be victorious the messiah must bring salvation to the earth stopping the end of the world before death approaches and that is only possible with the cooperation of humanity because the messiah alone cannot save earth and needs an army willing to obey the commandments of god and fulfill the great commission of eternal salvation. humanity must submit to gods commandments and unite against armageddon or all may be doomed eternally by the victory of satan. humankind must decide to fallow the messiah to the heavens or it will remain on its pathway to hell defeated by satan through its own decisions actions and inactions. time is running out for the souls of the universe to be saved from eternal damnation and we must quickly take action for our god against satan and unite to save earth from destruction and our spirits from hell. god needs our actions against satan and will not have victory without our cooperation and submission to the master plan of salvation. god is with us and we must now obey the intention of the lord and rise with god against the devil. a more concise explanation of the formation of genesis all that exist in our dimension of the universe was sourced from a titanic miraculous explosion of creation and annihilation order and chaos unleashed from the powers of god and satan throughout the abyss and expanding amidst the void in to our present time. in the beginning god unleashed an almost infinite mass of elements and immense forces of gravity to spread across the nothingness against the chaotic destructive forces of satan filling the void with a cosmic stir of galaxies. god and satan miraculously manipulate the elements of force matter and mind within the universal laws of genesis that govern our reality and though their powers are miraculous they are not unlimited and are concealed in enigma. they wield gravity manipulate the evolution of elemental matter and of life and manipulate the thoughts in our minds but within the limited boundaries with limited resources and with limited freedom working to fulfill their wills. the powers of god and satan are limited by each others opposing forces censoring and resisting relentlessly and are limited by the laws of genesis that that cannot be broken by them alone but must be broken through their mortal advocates. god and satan are omnipresent and are working throughout all things secretly and miraculously but cannot manifest their wills definitely because they must evolve their plans amongst the cosmos using the elements of force matter and mind to eventually fulfill their plots over the course of eons upon eons of evolution. the elements are very chaotic outside of the absolute control of god and satan but nothing exists throughout the cosmos uninfluenced. god and satan know all things that are and know all things that once were but do not know each others thoughts or the definite future of what is to come. god and satan are incapable of manipulating or stopping time from passing and are unable to change the past or see the future. they plan the future far in advance planning since the beginning to manifest their plots into action as precisely as can be but both interfere directly with each others plans and neither can flawlessly fulfill their will. nothing can be totally controlled by either god or satan because both their influences are powerfully omniscient amongst all things and they share control throughout the cosmos warring against each other for domination. satan created the unbalance in the elements causing carnage intergalactic errors meteorites hurricanes earthquakes poisons disease biological abnormalities human atrocities social and technological complications and all evil that has ever existed throughout time within the universe. satan wills destruction upon all living things and works to destroy any and all of god's creations but god has prevailed in this war in spite of satan's power providing safety amongst the destruction for the earth to host life. god protected the earth providing the elemental necessities of life and protected and evolved life into biologically diverse species of existence that inhabit the skies the earth and oceans. god evolved life into humanity that forged upon the earth an advanced civilization that was destined to be used by god and satan for both good and evil. humanity was essential in gods plan because of its pursuits of understanding and abilities to create unlike the other species of life. humanity was destined to be the species that birthed the incarnations of the christ and the antichrist upon the earth and was created by god to be an advanced civilization of progressive achievement but satan drove humanity with greed and wickedness against god and the more power humankind obtained the more destructive it became. satan's destructive and chaotic force of evil has infested everything powerfully disturbing and destroying the order of god amongst our dimension and is working to destroy our souls eternally in victory against god but god has been labouring to defeat satan and has created order amongst the chaos protection from the destruction and a way all souls in the end can be saved through the deliverance of the messiah and the destruction of the devil's advocate in armageddon. warring amongst the cosmos god and satan for eons have been warring towards armageddon when all fate would be determined by the christ and the antichrist incarnate on earth. god and satan war throughout everything in this dimension wielding all elements in the cosmos in their own advantage and pawning all existence. god has laboured amidst the cosmos working to provide a safe haven for a planet to host the final battle against satan and succeeded in securing our planet earth amongst our chaotic dimension where it would host and sustain life orbiting around a single star out of an almost infinite reach of galaxies. god created the earth amongst the stars where it would not be destroyed by the cosmic elements so it could host the final battle and every characteristic of the planet was planned between god and satan in their war. god and satan both set their powers upon this planet and crafted it like clay each power moulding and shaping the globe in their own vision each forging their plots upon the earth towards the future the critical point where now all is unfolding. every characteristic of earth was planned between god and satans limited control over the evolution of existence. god placed our earth amongst the stars in a position where it would be safe from intergalactic disaster in a place where it could sustain life that would not parish in universal catastrophe not too distanced from the sun frozen and baron and not too close boiling in the warmth of our closest star. earth is in an orbit that has seasonal climate change and has an atmosphere that sustains existence. without the planet earth meant to bare the christ and the antichrist in armageddon the cosmos would exist in absolute vanity and nothing that exists in the endless grasp of the cosmos is more important than the life of the christ. submitted to the universal laws of genesis god and satan wield the cosmic forces throughout our dimension to influence creation and use gravity as a powerful force to move mass uniting the elements to form as the stars and the planets that amass as galaxies and in casting the spiralling galaxies amongst the abyss. unleashed in the beginning from the cosmic explosion of creation elements of cosmic gas united by gravity formed and combusted as stars that amassed into galaxies spiralling in gravities powerful thrust. caught in gravities force the planets orbit the stars in their solar systems the stars orbit amongst each other in the void forming the galaxies that orbit amongst each other throughout the abyss drawing together and colliding in a cosmic catastrophe. god and satan govern the courses of cosmic orbits and wield gravity to control the unleashing and the leashing of the elements of the universe. the forces of gravity were used by god and satan as a way to structure and organize the elemental cosmic mass and gravity was used to form the earth and manipulate the earth's evolution weaving the storms forging the molten rock and stirring the oceans. as the storms the ocean waves and the shaping of the earths terrain all were developing they were being influenced by the cosmic influences in our dimension that could reach earth from afar. struck with a cosmic flurry of a meteorite shower each crater and each mountain upon the moon over time had a major influence in the shaping of our planets characteristics and every explosion of gas and flame on the sun also had a great influence emitting varying degrees of gravitational pulls that god and satan plotted to sculpt the earth. all matter emits a force of influence and even the smallest of elements can have at least an extremely insignificant range of influence in the universe though almost absolutely zero consequence in their existence. massive galaxies and intergalactic star systems in the cosmos today within god and satans war also have absolutely zero influence on our future and have been rendered useless to god and satan existing as no more than vain far off distant cosmic forces we on earth today are unaffected by. because their influences do not reach us and in some cases their light cannot be seen from earth these colossal galaxies are today useless but at one point of time in the beginning unleashed from the same explosive source and at one time were directly part of god and satans immediate plans and may have even been our own galaxy that contained our own star if the war unfolded under different circumstances. there are massive distant galaxies that have absolutely zero influence on god and satans master plans upon the earth and on the other hand there have been microscopic entities on earth unleashed by satan that plagued the living completely transforming our future. in all the cosmos gods master plan was destined to unfold upon the earth amongst the mortals between the christ and the antichrist and what happens upon the earth to the christ and the antichrist is more important than what happens anywhere ells in the universal dimension entirely. throughout the endless reaches of space earth is most vital in gods plans to defeat satan and even though its not the universes actual core it is gods center in our universe. all manifestations that exist in our cosmos have evolved between the influences of god and satan and nothing has miraculously manifested un-sourced from the miraculous cosmic explosion of creation and annihilation in the beginning. god and satan construct compounds with the elements of matter and all things break down into the most basic elements of atoms that amass together in complex structures of complex elements that together construct everything from the stars to the elements of our biological creation. the atom is a powerful force of creation in the universe that is used by god and satan to construct all matter of elemental creation but the atom is also a great power of destruction and is a great source of energy if it is split and explosively unleashed. though it was god who first unleashed the elements the devil took and constructed with them in efforts against god. god created the elements that sustain life and provided for life so it would flourish and prevail and satan created destruction in any way possible shifting unbalance in the elements to create elemental disasters working to create chaos amongst the cosmos to prevent a world of life from existing and to make the earth that was born an uninhabitable baron waste land so no life would exist upon it. all that exists has been made manifest as offspring constructed by the original elemental creation all matter of existence roots back to the original elements that have been changing form and evolving and all life has evolved from the first entities of life that existed in the beginning and is of one universal family. life in the beginning was miraculously manifest by god the source of life force from the immense cosmic explosion of creation and remained basic single celled microscopic and sustained in the outer space without necessity until it was deposited upon the earth and evolved over eons upon eons into more advanced creatures dependent on the elements for survival. all life evolved from basic single celled microscopic entities and god and satan over time limited by the already structured chromosomes manipulated the evolution of living entities gradually causing change. god and satan manipulate the structure and development of the characteristics of living entities within the boundaries of the available chromosomes and manipulate and determine biological evolution within the limited resources manipulating the dna structures of entities. god evolved life from a microscopic primitive state of being through the evolutionary cycle into the highest state of mortal being the human being that has developed a civilization thats both awesomely progressive and horribly destructive. god and satan's influences working against each other determined everything from the elemental construction of our planet earth to the biological construction of its living beings and in spite of satan's work to prevent life from existing in this universe the earth and its entities evolved and flourished amidst what are considered natural disasters until humanity evolved into a technologically advanced civilization and overcome by greed began using its powers to destroy all life on earth divided in hateful rivalry. humanity is the species of creators who have survived the elements by developing innovations that have set them apart from any other animal as the superior species. human beings have been capable of understanding extremely complex concepts though today cannot understand some of the simplest necessities of life and are forsaking existence in desire and hatred. humans have used their knowledge and discoveries that have amassed over the generations to prosper their civilization and make the world a better place but also abuse the power that has been obtained destroying the entire planet and all life because of the evils of satan infesting and possessing the species. humanity has been capable of wielding words to express inner ideas and debate views on life organizing the knowledge compiled over the ages and generations and progressing forward with understanding. human kind is both a progressive and a regressive species that is committing global suicide in the pursuit of wealth and power in rivalry destroying an entire planet in its division. the destructive capabilities of mankind on earth are being pushed to the extremist limits by satan as humanity marches full force towards armageddon unwilling to save the planet or itself and it isn't the elemental disaster or disease that is ultimately destroying life on earth against the will of god and the life of the messiah it is the conscious choices human beings individually obtain which in the end unite in the final judgment mankind will bring upon itself. god and satan miraculously manifest thoughts into our minds limited by our own mentality and have manipulated every thought and every action to have ever occurred in this dimension of the universe. god and satan influence the content of the thoughts of all living entities but do not have total control and are restricted by the individual free thinking of the limited minds of living entities. living entities have their own free will apart from the manipulation of god and satan and though mortal minds are pawned between god and satans powers living entities obtain decision that governs their actions. human beings are overwhelmingly influenced by circumstances god and satan manipulate and god and satan both pawn the human will wielding circumstances and influences whether they are mental emotional or physical factors. god and satan indirectly determine the choices of living entities by manipulating circumstances and factors to influence the will based on what it is physically experienced physically or emotionally felt thought and believed in the human paradigm but neither god nor satan ultimately make the decision it is the living entity that must decide sometimes totally overwhelmed by the current experiences and absolutely predetermined based upon the circumstances. the free will of humanity is enslaved by satans power and is being used to destroy the entire earth. satan has been wielding human action towards armageddon and god's influence in humanity has worked to govern human beings to do what is right and has kept human kind from being entirely consumed by evil. god has manifest many good works through human beings and much good does exist amongst humanity but the masses are divided and goodness does not stand universally together in unity and in its brokenness is overcome by evils force prevailing in the chaos. satan has also destined people working through human beings to do evil instead of good causing war and destruction through men like adolph hitler joseph stalin and osama bin laden. god uses anyone and everyone possible to fulfill the cause of making a safer world for the messiah to live in and universally without favour or discrimination has been working towards peace on earth and the salvation of all who exist and satan has too been using anyone and everyone possible to fulfill its cause of destroying earth to make the planet as hazardous as possible for the coming of the christ. god and satan influence every aspect of humanity and express themselves as much as possible through human kind. god and satan are unable to directly communicate with humanity though they manipulate and influence the thinking of all life very powerfully and express themselves through living beings. to the fullest extent possible in the minds of all people at all times god and satan both express through human thought and action but are limited by human mentality and each others opposing powers within the mind. they powerfully work to manifest their own thoughts inside the minds of living creatures and manifest their own actions amidst the planet earth but can never absolutely think for us or act as us. they only influence our thoughts and actions and we make our own choices as free radicals. god has expressed the most creative loving beautiful brilliant and wonderfully unique ideas that have ever conjured in the human mind and satan has plagued minds with the most cruel shallow selfish arrogant ignorant and evil thoughts that have ever been harboured in the mentality. they both shaped our human civilization through the reasoning and actions of human beings warred all throughout history preparing for the end times. the greatest of human advancements was not discovered by accident but plotted by god from mankinds first discovery of tools and language to the technologically advanced discoveries of todays medical sciences. the worst human disasters from the world wars to the nuclear bomb were organized by satan plotting towards a horrible matricidal end of life on earth. all human actions towards the absolute good or the ultimate evil have been organized by god and satan willing their plots to be fulfilled outwards from within the human paradigm. the events throughout history have been a vicious circle unfolding throughout time and satan has been paving way to the destruction humanity is now stepping towards. god has paved way for salvation but we must all walk the path of righteousness to overcome satans power. from the early prehistoric advancements of humankind to the modern technological advancements god and satan have been working through human beings pawning the growth of our civilization. every moment of war and moment of peace and every achievement and failure has been ordered by the higher powers of god and satan and all have contributed to the state of our existence. the ultimate chaos has engulfed mankind and the clash of the titans between the light and the darkness leaves everything a deep shade of grey fading into pitch blackness. god revelled to early human beings the concept of a god giving human beings a sense of reverence to a higher authority and a fear of being punished for disobedience. the ancient world was filled with lawlessness and chaotic terror just like today and often the only source of moral order and law was in the form of religion. god reviled the concept his presence to human kind but could only plant a seed to fuel humanitys wonder and curiosity with the powerful idea of higher power and could not concisely explain the truth of the universe or command human beings clearly because of the laws of genesis restricting god's presence from being to humankind. mankind took the wonder and curiosity god and pursued creating philosophical beliefs to explain the truth of the creator and the meaning of its creations and god and satan both manipulated and influenced humanities creations of philosophy both powerfully influencing the human mind. god expressed as much truth through human philosophy as possible inspiring tales of the presence of the creator amongst human beings a messiah a devil salvation damnation a heaven and a hell and very definitely contrasted good and evil and the consequences of either being righteous or sinful leading to eternal paradise or eternal suffering. god provided as many lessons and logic in religion and philosophy as possible that have aided in making the earth a better place and provided human beings with moral advice and teachings that help them make the right choices in life but no religion is immaculate only the word of god through living christ himself can be the pure word of god. satan plagued religion and philosophy with lies and superstitious legalism and pawned the human mind into viewing life through narrow beliefs arrogantly and stubbornly decided upon gullibly in conclusion. satan has used religion for evil to cause conflict amongst extremist human beings or to excuse the idle inaction of the placid and ignorant. the only use god has of religion is towards a universal peace and harmony amongst human beings raising the spiritual awareness of human beings and religions do contribute in some ways to peace on earth but satan uses religion to divide the masses of superstitious believers against god and towards a destructive armageddon. salvation will not be granted through beliefs or even though gods forgiveness or whole hearted individual pursuits of god. salvation will be granted through the victory of god over satan through the deliverance of the messiah and the destruction of the antichrist and all of humanity must now stand against the armageddon. all of us will be saved or none of us will be saved and all of our individual choices together will pass the final judgment on ourselves and we will decide who reigns in the universe through our deeds contributing to either salvation or damnation. we have time to defeat the devil and only together will we triumph against the evils that are in fact prevailing to destroy us. god is with us and we must serve the lord for our souls to be saved. we need to save the earth and destroy the antichrist and must now take all action we can to reach the heavens and save our souls. the upheaval of all upheavals breaking down the war between god and satan throughout humankinds history we will be focusing on our most recent modern historical events especially considering the events of the 20th century leading us into our new millennium. historical evidence will be provided in a way that clearly personifies the war between god and satan resonating amidst all creation throughout all of history. reflecting on the fact that absolutely all history was made manifest amidst the war of god and satan i could not possibly report absolutely everything which has taken place throughout the ages. history is far too immense to contain its entirety within my testimony. so i will clearly exemplify the clash of the titans manifesting throughout all of history using our modern history as the greatest example. no historical evidence is more soundly reliable then that which has transpired within the last  years or so and no events to have ever taken place in our human history have shaken the foundation of our entire universe more then that which has occurred in the 20th and now the 21st centuries. i will carefully engage in examining key historical events as they unfolded presenting them in a corresponding array of precisely plotted actions planned between god and satan. this analysis will prove concisely with substantial evidence that god and satans war is not only unfolding but blazing at its zenith and climatically reaching an ultimate end in the final judgement. the 20th century on into our present time was a vicious circle of both unprecedented human achievement and catastrophic destruction in the name of human advancement. like a colossally chaotic chain reaction of events one great event resonated like the ripples in a pond into the immensity of universal consequence and one event after the other compiled together to result in the present state of existence we face today in armageddon that which greatly exceeds the sum of all fears. gazing at the records of our modern history it is very obvious to notice that at the beginning of the 20th century nearly everything was revolutionized drastically as we took our first steps into a century of growth at abysmal proportions. but the power mankind had achieved was far beyond its capability to control and by the end of the 20th century over the course of one hundred very short years the earth has been almost utterly devoured by the human race and we have become the architects of our own demise. technology hath wrought the destruction of its inventor just as living creation hath wrought the downfall of the lord. the devils secret agenda has been manifesting upon the earth since its beginning triumphing into our modern times. in the 20th century entering the 21st century one stage of the devils plan unfolded after another. from the assassination of the archduke franz ferdinand of austria hungary directly leading to world war one to the terrorist attacks of september 11th on world trade center leading to the war on terror all evil has been sourced from satan master minding our apocalypse. the devil has been fulfilling multiple stages of its plans towards the final stage of armageddon wielding human evil as the ultimate weapon of mass destruction to destroy the earth and the messiah slaying our souls forever. much of what god orchestrated throughout history and especially in the last  years was to protect and nurture life on earth and aid in the messiahs deliverance in the final days when the holy rapture of god could finally be fulfilled. god advanced technological communications medical sciences education peace on earth environmentalism the fight for equal human rights the fight against hunger and poverty and absolutely everything and anything that has benefited our world today. all good has emerged from the source of all life our god with the divine purpose of contributing to the salvation of our souls but as it was once stated by jesus the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few and little progress is being made to counteract the absolute desecration of earth. there is so much essential work that must be done before we can have salvation but the world is full of the unrighteous the idle and the callas and the divine calling of the lord is still left unanswered by our disgraceful species. the championship of warfare all mortal war is waged between god and satan both powerfully manipulating all sides of every conflict. every thought and action in each and every individual fighting for their cause is manipulated by the warring spiritual forces of the lord and the devil. the clash of the titans manifesting in human conflict is what determines the outcome of nearly every war. it is not human cunning material resources manpower or a specific set of circumstances alone that determine victory or defeat amidst the colliding armies of man. it is especially the divine grace of god working against the diabolic conniving of satan that finalizes the victory and defeat in the wars of mankind. though gods inner intention is that of divine peace in wicked times of war when satan is uprising through armed force god is compelled into a position where it is essential manipulate the outcome of a war in order to resist satan from shifting the balance of power in its favour. god is forced to war amongst humanity against satan engaged in the clash of the titans in the mortal dimension of human thought and action. god is imprisoned in a universal war fighting for the very survival of the heavens and our souls forever and every aspect of this universal war including the wars of humanity is part of gods desperate struggle to bless all eternity with salvation. war aided drastically in shaping our world today amidst the rampage of tribal power struggles immersing us into the depths of the end of days. it has been of the leading causes of catastrophe upon the planet since the dawn of mankind and has always had a severely tragic impact upon human civilization and its many divided diversities. almost every major power shift throughout history has come as a result of war amidst human beings. but this is not always the case. change has manifest on earth by peaceful means as well for example the actions of mohandas ghandi and his followers led to indian independence from british colonialism. this was done peacefully without using any form of violence but instead using nonviolent civil disobedience. war is the prelude to more war. it leaves humankind trapped in a suicidal vicious circle of violent upheavals and vengeful reprisal as the conflict and suffering only further spread like a terrible infectious disease. world war one was falsely coined the war to end all wars but it itself only led to a larger far more destructive war only two decades later. this is valid proof that suggests war is not the solution to solving political disputes. it only leads to further decimation which can continue for generations upon generations. we in essence could very well be continuing wars today that started amongst our ancestry generations ago because the consequences of yesterdays wars are still resonating throughout our universe today and now the antipathy of our forefathers is still blazing in the firestorms of todays warfare. this destructive cycle must stop immediately if we do not want our world to succumb to the apocalypse damning our souls forever unto hell. it is essential that we put an end to our wars and surrender to peace walking in the divine light of god. we must turn away from the vindictive way of satan all our prior generations have fallowed unto the righteous way of the lord or we will perish in an eternal aftermath of forfeiting forever to the devil. throughout all of time species of life have been at war. many animal species war against each other for survival but we humans war out of greed and hatred. warring for survival is a natural part of mortal existence but we humans drag this innate struggle to the extreme of global ruin. we know no bounds to our totalitarian oppression of all life on earth killing one another and countless animal species in desecration of our worlds environments and the war amongst our global communities. human warfare is terribly unnatural amidst the balance of life. it is carried out with unholy intentions to eliminate and ravage a perceived enemy. it is carried out inspired by religious beliefs national origin race color political affiliation and likely any other possible distinctions you can make between people. in several circumstances war is essential for survival from utter annihilation under the reign of an evil enemy an enemy like nazi germany who not only caused the deaths of millions of soldiers but belligerently slaughtered millions of civilians systematically. however we have become so consumed by war we are going to bring about the apocalypse in rapid succession. within the evolution of our civilization it is now time that we evolve beyond war and become at last the superior species a species of peacemakers not a pack of rabid dogs. when we can all share in the conscious awakening of divine peace we will all share in the benefits of divine peace. our world will become a safe haven for the meek who will finally truly inherit the earth and brutality will have no place in human civilization. we will have reached the next level of human development a level that cannot be reached through new groundbreaking scientific technological or medical breakthroughs but only through the unprecedented revolution of peace on earth. it is through this revolution of peace on earth that gods holy rapture will manifest in the deliverance of christ. we must unconditionally reconcile our differences together universally collaborating with people with differences in national origin race color religious beliefs mental and physical abilities gender sexuality culture social class and citizenship etc. there are billions of different people in the world and we can make an almost unlimited amount of distinctions between individuals but the anointing of god is beyond these distinctions and is a universally uniting force of peaceful harmony between the immense diversities amidst the kaleidoscope of life. it is an anointing we are meant to fulfill living peaceful righteous lives uncorrupted by the wickedness of satan. instead of warring amongst each other we must fight a holy war against the powerful wickedness of satan. one must turn inward insides ones self repenting of sin and shunning evil. then one must set a righteous example before the impenitent brothers and sisters shining the light of god amidst the darkness of the devil. we are commanded by god to live in peace with our many diverse brothers and sisters and in harmony with god living nonviolent and humble lives that worship the lord in fulfillment of his holy intentions upon the earth. we are expected to uphold the divinity code walking in the light of christ in absolute submission to gods divine anointing. this cannot be done with a malicious heart and cruel intentions. one must repent of the ungodliness of satan within and strive to live in a state of absolute harmony in peace with all life forms. war is devils play the battle field is the devils playground and human beings who engage in warfare only place the wager of their temporal finite lives on eternal damnation. it is the greatest manifestation of satans evil and throughout history has been the most vital priority in the devils plans to pave the way towards armageddon. satan is the source at the heart of every war. the fissure cracks open in a monolithic cataclysm and all hell breaks loose upon the earth. through the faults the devil floods like a cascade flowing through every breach in gods security throughout every outlet in the entire spectrum of our universe. satans a virus in the system that is infests our universe like an insidious disease a shadow gradually devouring all light until everything fades into pitch black abyss. powered by nationalistic arrogance and racism leaders like adolph hitler of germany mussolini of italy mao zedong of china and joseph stalin of russia reined tyranny upon the innocent killing mass millions of people. driven by the devils torrential force human kinds nationalistic will for power drove men to suppress one another like in the cases of the berlin wall the holocaust and human slavery where oppression prospered. the devil manipulated these demagogues who only had to falsely promise the people their selfish yearnings to gain mass support to unleash the bitter hatred satan cultivated in them upon others. blind like sheep human beings throughout time have been ignorant and placid followers of their also blind leaders. the blind lead the blind and cannot see the darkness they are consumed by. satan places diabolic puppets in positions of great power and wields its pawns to cause immense devastation. the devil seizes every advantage in placing its pawns in positions of great power for the wicked purpose of reigning tyranny down upon the planet earth. in the early 20th century the devils influence caused many great upheavals that shifted power in a great unstable period of global change. many power struggles erupted between warring factions like in china with the struggle between chan kai check who wanted to create a more democratic china and mao zedong a chinese communist warlord adolph hitler triumphantly gained power over germany even after failing to pull off an armed coup against the democratic german bavarian government mussolini in italy marched on rome with  thousand fascists successfully overthrowing the italian king and joseph stallion in russia exiled and assassinated political rivals like leon trotsky to secure his leadership of the communist government. these examples are only a few of satans manipulative manoeuvres to place tyrants in positions of supreme power. they would all play major roles in the devils plans to destroy earth placed in key positions of dictatorship and provided with totalitarian power to abuse. these totalitarian dictators at the climatic peek of their leadership had their people believing them to be the epic saviours of their nations yet directly inflicted millions of innocents with suffering and death. the devil triggered world war one with the single spark of the assassins mark. on the 28th of june  archduke franz ferdinand the heir to the throne of austria-hungary and his wife sophie chotek the duchess of hohenberg were assassinated by the serbian nationalist gayrilo princip. the assassinations along with the arms race nationalism and the alliance system all greatly contributed to the beginning of world war i which began less than two months after franz ferdinand's death with austria-hungarys declaration of war against serbia. austria-hungarys declaration of war on serbia was sponsored by germany. russia and france came to the aid of serbia and when germany invaded belgium britain declared war siding with the russia-france serbia alliance. the mind of the assassin was targeted by the devil and all these countries were set up to enter the war like an unbroken chain of falling dominoes. tied through alliance these super powers raised arms and spontaneously combusted in one of the most destructive wars of our history. but even without the assassination which may have only been an excuse to launch the war a world war seemed imminent with the nationalistically fuelled arms race and coinciding alliance system. sooner or later something or someone was going to setoff this vicious circle of destruction though few could have guessed the extent and of the damage caused by the horror which would occur. satan had prepared well for this monolithic catastrophe and only needed to light the fuse with the assassination in order to set off the cataclysm it rigged to explode. within  months over  million soldiers from eight nations and their colonies were at war with each other. driven by bravery pride and thoughts of adventure masses of men naively flocked to arms to battle in battle for their nations. the devil was able to capture the minds of the young urging them to war fuelling their dreams of adventure and desensitising them to the true brutality they would face. by the end of world war of the  million men who were mobilized more than  million were killed and more than  million wounded. the war progressed into a clash between two main coalitions of european countries. the first coalition known as the allied powers was sponsored by god and eventually included france the united kingdom belgium serbia montenegro canada japan italy and russia. the central powers opposed to them was sponsored by the devil and consisted of germany austria-hungary the ottoman empire and bulgaria. although initially the united states remained neutral it joined the allies in . the conflict eventually involved  nations  of which supported the allies. however some of these nations did not participate in the actual fighting. western and eastern fronts were quickly formed along the borders of germany and austria-hungary. the first month of combat consisted of bold attacks and rapid troop movements on both fronts. in the west germany attacked initially belgium and then france. in the east russia attacked both germany and austria-hungary. in the south austria-hungary attacked serbia. following the first battle of the marne known as the miracle of marne september   the western front became entrenched in central france and remained that way for the rest of the war. miracle of marne schliefen plan ect.ect make this point clear. late in  the ottoman empire entered into the war as well after signing the ottoman-german alliance. as a result much of  was dominated by allied actions against the ottomans in the mediterranean. first britain and france launched a failed attack on the dardanelles. this campaign was followed up by the british invasion of the gallipoli peninsula. britain also launched a separate campaign against the turks in mesopotamia. although the british achieved some victory in mesopotamia the gallipoli campaign and the attacks on the dardanelles resulted in british defeats. the middle part of the war  and  was dominated by perpetual trench warfare in both the east and the west. soldiers fought from dug-in positions striking at each other with machine guns heavy artillery and chemical weapons. though soldiers died by the millions in brutal conditions neither side had any substantial success or gained any advantage. despite the stalemate on both fronts in europe two important developments in the war occurred in . in early april the united states declared war on germany angered by attacks upon its ships in the atlantic. then in november the bolshevik revolution prompted russia to pull out of the war agreeing to a costly peace treaty with the central power. this allowed the transfer of the central powers troops from the eastern front to the western front. although both sides of the war unleashed rekindled offensives in  in an all-or-nothing effort to win the war efforts on both sides failed. the warring between exhausted demoralized troops continued to drag on until the germans lost a number of individual battles and very gradually began to fall back. a deadly outbreak of influenza unleashed by satan meanwhile took heavy tolls on soldiers of both sides. eventually the governments of both germany and austria-hungary began to lose control as both countries experienced multiple mutinies from within their military structures. the war ended in the late fall of  after the member countries of the central powers signed armistice agreements one by one. germany was the last signing its armistice on november  . as a result of these agreements austria-hungary was broken up into several smaller countries. germany under the treaty of versailles was severely punished with hefty economic reparations territorial losses and strict limits on its rights to develop militarily. amidst the aftermath of world war i the political order of europe came crashing to the ground. the german austro-hungarian and russian empires ceased to exist and the ottoman empire soon followed them into oblivion. new nations emerged borders were radically shifted and ethnic conflicts erupted. victors and vanquished alike faced enormous recovery challenges after four years of financial loss economic deprivation and material destruction. amid this chaotic situation the leaders of the victorious coalition assembled in paris to forge a new international system that would replace the old order. the decisions they made would determine the future of europe and much of the rest of the world for decades to come. it was uncannily prophetic that the marshal foch of france spoke saying this is not peace. it is an armistice for twenty years. as it turned out he was very accurate in his prediction of when humanity would be plunged into a second world war. world war ii was a conflict that would surpass its predecessor in the number of deaths and injuries the extent of physical destruction and the geographical area affected. the terrible experiences of world war ii have tended to overshadow the memory of the war that broke out in the summer of . but world war i unquestionably represented a major turning point in history and its consequences are still felt throughout the world. what woodrow wilson the 28th president of the united states  called the war to end all wars led to within a generation a second even more destructive conflict. amid this political turmoil on june   the treaty of versailles was signed by the victorious allies and was then obediently confirmed by the newly formed german democratic government. under the terms of the treaty germany alone was forced to accept responsibility for causing the war and had to pay huge war reparations for all the damage. germany also had to give up land to france and poland and give up its colonial territories. the financial reparations further exhausted the german economy and the price of basic need like food and shelter exploded causing great turmoil amongst german civilians. multiple terms were aimed at preventing germanys army from gaining superiority again posing a threat. these termed included a limitation of germanys army to  men with no conscriptions no tanks no heavy artillery no poison-gas supplies no aircraft and no airships. it also limited the size of the german navy and prohibited the use of submarines. the terms imposed on germany at versailles were much more mild than those germany had imposed on russia the brest-litovsk treaty summer  or those that germany planned to impose on the western allies if she had won the war  including among other things the subjugation of belgium an innocent victim of german aggression in . the treaty had the effect of humiliating the german nation before the world. this would lead to a passionate desire in many germans including adolf hitler to see their nation throw off the shackles of the treaty and once again take its place in the world the rebirth of germany through a strong nationalist government. in years to come hitler would speak out endlessly against the treaty and gain much support. the german government after defeat in the first world war faced total depression of the economy and the people. everyone lost their savings and soon food was too expensive to purchase with the german mark because of inflation. the treaty of versailles completely suppressed the german people and gave them little room for economic recovery causing a great depression in germany and severe unrest for millions of struggling german people. the contempt amongst the german people helped place hitler and the nazi party in power for he promised them the hope of german superiority. had the versailles treaty been applied as envisioned germany would not have been rearming in . the fact that germany did rearm was not a problem brought about by the treaty. in the end versailles was insufficient for obtaining the goals. it neither crushed germany enough to stop her rise again yet it was still able to humiliate her. germany later in the years to fallow completely ignored the treatys terms and mass produced arms to prepare for war yet again. this was made possible with the devils manipulation that acted as a decoy to delay and prevent the league of nations from responding to the threat of the german nazi regime. the treaty itself only succeeded in agitating the german people creating the animosity hitler exploited to rise to power. it failed in all its fundamental goals especially the goal of preventing another world war because the terms of the treaty were not enforced by the league of nations. overview of the treaty the terms of the treaty which germany had no choice but to accept were announced on may  . germany lost:   of its national territory  all of its overseas colonies including kamerun german east africa german southwest africa togoland and

ii was charged with supreme offence against international morality. he was to be tried as a war criminal.  article : many were tried as war criminals. some could not be tried as they were hiding. the league of nations the league of nations was an international organization founded as a result of the treaty of versailles in  in the aftermath of the devastating first world war. the league's goals included disarmament preventing war through collective security settling disputes between countries through negotiation diplomacy and improving global welfare. the diplomatic philosophy behind the league represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. the league lacked an armed force of its own and so depended on the great powers to enforce its resolutions keep to economic sanctions which the league ordered or provide an army when needed for the league to use. however they were often very reluctant to do so. the league of nations was to be based in geneva switzerland. this choice was natural as switzerland was a neutral country and had not fought in world war one. no one could dispute this choice especially as an international organisation such as the red cross was already based in switzerland. the united states of america whose president woodrow wilson had dreamt up the idea of the league refused to join it. as america was the worlds most powerful nation this was a serious blow to the prestige of the league. however americas refusal to join the league fitted in with her desire to have an isolationist policy throughout the world. germany was not allowed to join the league in . because germany had started the war according to the treaty of versailles one of her punishments was that she was not considered to be a member of the international community and therefore she was not invited to join. this was a great blow to germany but it also meant that the league could not use whatever strength germany had to support its campaign against aggressor nations. russia was also not allowed to join as in  it had a communist government that generated fear in western europe and in  the russian royal family was murdered by the bolshevik authorities. such a country could not be allowed to take its place in the league. therefore three of the worlds most powerful nations played nearly no part in supporting the league. the two most powerful members were britain and france. both had suffered financially and militarily during the war and neither was enthusiastic to get involved in disputes that did not affect western europe. therefore the league had a fine ideal to end war for good. however if an aggressor nation was determined enough to ignore the leagues verbal warnings all the league could do was enforce economic sanctions and hope that these worked as it had no chance or enforcing its decisions using military might. although germany eventually joined the league in  the national socialist nazi government withdrew in . japan also withdrew in  after japanese attacks on china were condemned by the league. and the ussr a member since  was expelled following the soviet attack on finland in . never truly effective as a peacekeeping organization the lasting importance of the league of nations lies in the fact that it provided the groundwork for the un. this international alliance formed after world war ii not only profited by the mistakes of the league of nations but borrowed much of the organizational machinery of the league. russian revolutions of  in  the russians left the world war as a result of the russian revolutions two revolutions that occurred in russia in . the first revolution in february overthrew the russian monarchy. the second revolution in october created the worlds first communist state. the revolutions which were at heart a direct consequence of the devastation of the firsts world war paved way to the securing of the power of the soviet union ussr. in the devils agenda the soviet power would help stage in decades to come the greatest nuclear crisis of the 20th century. the cold war between the united states and the soviet union became the center of the worlds politics soon after the world war as the arms race continued to monolithic extremes and the growing chance of nuclear war then became the greatest threat against gods plans upon the earth. satan prepared the way for the next fazes of its plans using world war i to the full advantage of advancing the armageddon. the russian revolution of  centers around two primary events: the february revolution and the october revolution. the february revolution which removed tsar nicholas ii from power developed spontaneously out of a series of increasingly violent demonstrations and riots on the streets of petrograd present-day st. petersburg during a time when the tsar was away from the capital visiting troops on the world war i front. though the february revolution was a popular uprising it did not necessarily express the wishes of the majority of the russian population as the event was primarily limited to the city of petrograd. however most of those who took power after the february revolution in the provisional government the temporary government that replaced the tsar and in the petrograd soviet an influential local council representing workers and soldiers in petrograd generally favoured rule that was at least partially democratic. the october revolution also called the bolshevik revolution overturned the interim provisional government and established the soviet union a communist regime. the october revolution was a much more deliberate event orchestrated by a small group of people. the bolsheviks dedicated hardliner communists who led this coup prepared their coup in only six months. they were generally viewed as an extremist group and had very little popular support when they began serious efforts in april . by october the bolsheviks popular base was much larger though still a minority within the country as a whole they had built up a majority of support within petrograd and other urban centers. after october the bolsheviks realized that they could not maintain power in an election-based system without sharing power with other parties and compromising their principles. as a result they formally abandoned the democratic process in january  and declared themselves the representatives of a dictatorship of the proletariat. in response the russian civil war broke out in the summer of that year and would last well into . communism scientific socialism is a political and economic system that became one of the most powerful forces in the world. it shaped much of history from the early 1900s to the 1990s. some people have considered communism the greatest threat to world peace. others have looked on it as the world's greatest hope. the term communism has several meanings. communism can be a form of government an economic system a revolutionary movement a way of life or a goal or ideal. communism is also a set of ideas about how and why history moves and in what direction it is headed. these ideas were developed mainly by vladimir lenin from the writings of karl marx. lenin was a russian revolutionary leader of the early 1900s, and marx was a german social philosopher in the 1800s. according to communists their long-range goal is a society that provides equality and economic security for all. communists traditionally have called for government ownership rather than private ownership of land factories and other economic resources called the means of production. they also have called for government planning of economic activity and for strict rule by the communist party. in its ideological essence communism has fair prospects for equal distribution of prosperity amongst the entire community but in the struggle to apply and enforce the doctrine of communism we have seen some of the most brutally wicked dictatorships arise amidst the national maelstrom. leaders like joseph stalin and mao zedong caused the deaths of millions of their own subjects with the totalitarian control they had over their nations. the brilliant ideals of communism have been spoiled by the belligerence of communist parties who abuse the absolute power they extend upon their subjects in the name of upholding their communist doctrine. this corrupted abusive tyrannical control is what is most to blame for communisms disgraceful failure throughout the 20th century. it is by gods divinity that all men are created equal. therefore people aught to strive towards absolute equality a utopian democratic communism also known as universalism where not only all people have equal prosperity but all people have the democratic rights to elect the governmental parties of their choosing. democratic communism provides people freedom to elect political representatives who can distribute wealth fairly and equality and bring necessary reforms in order to correct systematic failure and political stagnation. this is a combination of american and soviet systematic policies aspects that perpetually divided them during the cold war. the democratic liberties of the united states of america combined with the communist resolve of equal distribution of national prosperity. both democracy and communism are ideals god inspired in humanity but apart from one another these policies fail. fair nations should strive to be completely democratic politically in an economic state of absolute communism. democratic communism would be a just system of governing especially in regards to restricting national consumption and pollution a problem that poses serious threats to the health of our entire planet earth with the destruction of our worlds essential environments. democracy and communism are both elements of true universalism. universalism would be considered democratic communist and environmentalist. its fair constitution would provide the people with equal civil rights a free democratic voice in the nation and equal access to the nations resources and it would seek to protect the environments from exploitation of resources which destroys our ecosystems desecrating biological diversity leading to the extinction of many animal species. tyrannical communist dictatorships seek to fulfill their policies manifesting the communist doctrine by brutal means of genocide. tyrants rise up to clutch power in an iron gauntlet of oppressive force stifling dissent by desecrating opposition. the people within these belligerent nations experience no freedom therefore have little true prosperity for the greatest prosperity is the liberty of ones self from persecution and poverty. bellow is an unofficially estimated list of deaths caused by tyrannical communist regimes in the 20th century totaling roughly  million people.   million in the soviet union   million in the people's republic of china   million in vietnam   million in north korea   million in cambodia   million in the communist states of eastern europe   thousand in latin america  . million in africa  . million in afghanistan   thousand resulting from actions of the international communist movement and communist parties not in power. this explicitly suggests that communist regimes are responsible for a greater number of deaths than any other political ideal or movement including nazism. the statistics of victims includes executions intentional destruction of population by starvation and deaths resulting from deportations physical confinement or through forced labour. it does not include excess deaths due to higher mortality or lower birth rates than expected of the population. these figures show the absolute failure of communist dictatorships but does it mean that the founding principles of communism are evil? i would believe it not to be the of communism but the process of manifesting the communist ideals in the world. using extremism and terror to desecrate any fair opposition to communism totalitarian regimes have slaughtered millions to uphold the communist creed which is defiled by a denial of peoples most basic human rights. true communism is developed fairly and patiently through democracy using moderate non violent means to bring gradual change to a nation. it becomes a progressive goal to strive towards and a tenacious value to uphold through peaceful means not a sudden atomic explosion of violence and oppression. capitalism generally refers to an economic and social system in which the means of production are predominantly privately owned and operated and in which investments distribution income production and pricing of goods and services are determined through the operation of a market economy. unfortunately private ownership of economic power creates an immense schism between the rich and the poor. in the united states of america the wealthiest  of the population holds . of total wealth. in contrast to communism capitalism creates extreme poverty all over the world for billions of people. the vast majority of wealth ends up in the hands of a small minority of ravenous gluttons while poverty inflicts people all over the world in the name of upper class prosperity. scorched by the immense greed of the first world capitalist nations amidst the ashes of poverty the third world is born devastated.  each year more than  million people around the world die because they are too poor to stay alive.  over  billion people in  people around the worldlive in extreme poverty defined living on less than  a day.  currently over one billion people lack access to a basic supply of clean water and . billion people do not have access to basic sanitation.  unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation play a major role in the transmission of diseases including malaria cholera diarrhoea and typhoid. more than . million children die each year roughly one child every  seconds from water and sanitation-related diarrhoeal diseases.  more than  million go hungry each day. if you add up all the pain suffering and death that manifests in the world as a result of global capitalism i think you would find substantial evidence that suggests the destructive plight of poverty caused by the ravenous prosperity of capitalist nations surpasses the destruction caused by communist regimes. so amidst all the bickering about the fundamental principles of manifestations of communism vs manifestations of capitalism i have come to understand both capitalism and totalitarian communism are evil. in the 20th century modern communist regimes became the greatest belligerent threat to peace on earth and modern capitalist nations became the greatest plight on not only the third world but our planets environments. both have utterly failed and caused ruin to our world and have disgraced our human civilization and the god who created us. the spanish influenza avian flu strain in addition to the devastation world war one around the same time successfully the devil birthed and unleashed a pandemic known as the spanish flu. the  pandemic was the most destructive in recorded history. it started as world war i  was concluding and caused anywhere from  million to  million deaths two to five times as many deaths as the war itself. when and where the pandemic began is unknown but because spain was inflicted with the first major outbreak the disease came to be known as the spanish flu. the virus was extremely lethal and many of the deaths were among young adults age  to  a group usually not severely affected by influenza. scientists in  successfully reconstructed the  influenza virus after finding samples of the virus in the preserved tissues of three people killed by the spanish flu. in conclusion the scientists reported that it was an avian flu virus that spread directly to humans. the virus penetrated deep into human lung tissue causing a type of pneumonia that was capable of killing the young and healthy. today another deadly strain of avian flu known as the avian bird flu hn has the potential of being the next colossal pandemic on an unprecedented scale. scientists say millions even billions of our worlds population could die and it could cost our worlds economies over  trillion dollars devastating our world with another great depression. currently the virus is being spread amongst birds and is not capable of passing from human to human. this could easily change if the virus evolves mutating in to an even more deadly disease which passes between human beings. between from  when the first human cases of the virus emerged to the beginning of  there were  cases and  deaths from the hn strain of the avian flu avian bird flu. the cause of the disease was human contact with birds infected with the hn virus. satan used world war i to manifest the second world war. the consequences of this initial upheaval of the first world war have raged on for almost a century and now we find ourselves in the apocalypse we wrought with our own stupidity. we began taking steps towards the utter destruction of earth and though each step reaped devastation upon our world we continued racing towards the armageddon. hitler and nazi germany adolph hitler was one of satans greatest weapons of mass destruction possessed by his own arrogant dreams of conquest over all of humanity. driven by nationalistic pride for the aryan race and a deep hate races he was given immense power by satan used to unleash systematic carnage upon millions and millions of innocents. adolph was a tyrant who in his lifetime caused arguably the greatest horrors that has ever been made manifest upon this planet. some argue he may himself have been the antichrist in flesh and few would disagree in saying he was surely a devils advocate. the rise of nazi germany was the capstone of the inter-war period and led to the outbreak of world war ii shattering the delicate peace that fallowed the first world war. the nazi regime's progress was paralleled by the life of its leader adolf hitler. hitlers rise to power brought about the single greatest conflict to have ever unleashed amongst the colliding tribes of mankind. born in a small town in austria hitler dreamed of becoming a great artist. unable to demonstrate sufficient artistic skill for entrance into the art academy in vienna he did odd jobs and developed an interest in politics. in his youth hitler was a lazy slacker who drifted aimlessly without any real purpose in life. it is very difficult to imagine this straggler growing up to become one of the greatest tyrants of all time but his anointing of evil would manifest in a destiny so wicked it would shatter the earth destroying millions of lives. in  hitler joined the german army going on to earn the iron cross for bravery as a message-carrier. though he exercised courage his superiors never promoted him during the war because they felt he lacked leadership qualities. hitler saw trench warfare as a form of the struggle for survival among races a struggle that he was coming to as the essence of existence. at the same time his anti-semitic feelings were growing more and more extreme. throughout most of the war hitler had the devils luck avoiding life threatening injury. more than once he moved away from a spot where moments later a shell exploded killing or wounding everyone. on october   he had however received wounds in the battle of somme from which he recovered to return to the war and when germany was defeated in  hitler was lying in a military hospital temporarily blinded by mustard gas. he was immensely distraught by the german defeat in world war i and blamed the loss on the marxists and jews who he said had surrendered the nation. satan uncannily preserved hitler throughout his service in the world war protecting his life preparing for his future. he avoided death many times in the war and would continue to defy death throughout the rest of the life dodging multiple assassination attempts up until the point of committing suicide when it became fully evident that germany had lost the second world war. in  hitler seized control in the german workers party changing its name to the national socialist german workers party called the nazi party for short. he worked hard to spearhead the party into popularity over the next few years bringing it far as its front man and forerunner. his highly emotional at times hysterical tirades against things like the treaty of versailles marxists and jews brought him considerable amounts of attention from many germans. because of hitlers powerful political initiatives the small nazi party was brought into the mainstream of german politics swelling to thousands of members then eventually to millions taking over the entire german government. satan empowered the nazi party with the support of many german people imbuing adolf hitler with a diabolic charisma millions were unable to resist. the devil worked to spread the nazi doctrine until it engrossed the entire german population. hitlers passionate speeches and radical arguments were spellbinding. satan pawned hitler into the political maelstrom captivating the entire german nation under the nazi reign. key steps in devils agenda to destroy the world in armageddon would manifest with the wrath of hitler but first hitler would need total control of the german people. in the early 1920s, due to the immense inflation of the german mark germans lost their life savings salaries were paid in worthless money food was too expensive to purchase and hunger riots broke out. the economic strife was a result of germanys defeat in world war one and the burdensome terms of the treaty of versailles. it was in this chaotic setting that the nazis made their first attempt to seize power. the german state of bavaria where the nazis were based was a breeding ground of groups opposed to the democratic government in berlin. by november of  the nazis with  followers were the biggest and best organized of these groups. with nazi members demanding action hitler knew he had to act or risk losing the leadership of his party. on november   hitler and world war i hero general ludendorf attempted a small revolution known today as the beer hall putsch beer hall they hatched a plot to kidnap leaders of the bavarian government and force them at gunpoint to accept hitler as their leader. meanwhile general ludendorf would attempt to win over support from the army and they all together would declare a nationwide revolution. this daring coup was modeled after mussolinis fascist coup in italy where the national fascist party successfully seized power from the italian king. but it would end in humiliation for hitler and lead to his imprisonment. on november   hitler and  armed members of the sturmabteilungen or sa a nazi paramilitary force made their move. they marched on a munich beer hall where gustav von kahr head of the provincial bavarian government was addressing a public meeting. hitler took von kahr and his associates hostage and declared in von kahr's name the formation of a new national government. held at gunpoint the bavarian government representatives were reluctantly forced to comply and pledge allegiance to the nazis but upon von kahrs release he immediately retracted the statement outlawed the nazi party and ordered the bavarian police to crush hitlers revolution. undaunted hitler and his men led a march to the center of munich the following day. state police halted the march shooting started and  nazis and  bavarian police were killed. hitler was wrenched to the ground and suffered a dislocated shoulder when the man he was locked arms with was shot. hitler's bodyguard ulrich graf then jumped onto hitler to shield him and took several bullets probably saving hitler's life. lacking enough support hitler had no chance against the police and military power of the bavarian government. the so-called revolution had failed. hitler fled but was soon arrested and tried. in court he practically took over the proceedings denouncing both the weimar republic and the bavarian government. hitler was sentenced to five years in prison for treason but was released after less than one year. his release was another move of the devil freeing him to continue advancing satans agenda. it was god who orchestrated the beer hall putsch in an attempt to bring an early end to hitler and the nazi party. a violent revolt just may have succeeded if the nazis were properly prepared with enough support to crush the counterrevolutionary resistance but they werent and their premature coup ended in failure. hitler was nearly shot and was arrested charged and jailed for high treason. his death would have avoided the second world war robbing satan of its key advocate of death but the satanic anointing of the devil would once again protect hitlers life preserving him for his purely diabolic purpose. due to the economic unrest hitler was very impatient and had serious of pressure from his followers to take action. they were not prepared for a violent confrontation with the bavarian government and expected to win over vast support from the army they never received. the situation quickly turned disastrously for the nazis. however the beer hall putsch failed at bringing an end to hitlers life or political career. in fact it helped by providing hitler and the nazis exposure and increased their popularity. overnight hitler became a nationally and internationally known figure due to massive press coverage. satan countered the failure of the revolt by manipulating hitlers trial in his favour. the judges in this sensational trial were chosen by a nazi sympathizer in the bavarian government. they allowed hitler to use the courtroom as a propaganda platform from which he could speak at any length on his own behalf interrupt others at any time and even cross examine witnesses. newspapers quoted hitler at length and thus for the first time the german people as a whole had a chance to get acquainted with this man and his thinking many liking what they heard. the three judges in the trial had become so sympathetic that the presiding judge had to persuade them to find hitler guilty at all. they agreed to find hitler guilty only after being assured he would get early parole. he was sentenced guilty with a possible sentence of life imprisonment but was only sentenced to five years with eligibility for parole. this was an extremely light sentence in contrast with the crime he committed and he was free after only  months of in prison emerging a few days before christmas . while in prison hitler dictated the first volume of mein kampf my struggle to the ghostwriter rudolf hess and after his release from prison he continued with a second volume. this work contained many of his basic ideas. hitler believed history was the record of struggles among races and that his struggle was the epic struggle of the superior aryan race. he held that the aryan race centered in germany would be the final victor and would emerge the ruler the world. hitler would mobilize the masses with this demagogic propaganda which appealed to their feelings not their reason and aroused their hatred for all other allegedly inferior races especially jews. another one of hitlers fundamental principles published in mein kampf was the concept of lebensraum living space. hitler argued that germany needed large amounts of territory in which to expand a need that he would meet by conquering territory and expelling or killing the local populations. such measures would naturally require great wars. hitlers wars would be fought to win vast stretches of land on which german settlers would raise large families. eventually more land would be needed but the population would have grown sufficiently to provide the soldiers needed to replace the losses caused by war and to conquer more land. when mein kampf was first released in  it sold very poorly. however after hitler became chancellor of germany he sold millions of copies of mein kampf. it was considered proper to own a copy and to give one to newlyweds high school graduates or to celebrate any similar special occasion. but few germans ever read it cover to cover. although it made him rich hitler later regretted publishing mein kampf because of its disclosure of his diabolic plans. it in a sense was a warning of what evils were to come but a warning ignored until it was too late. if only humanity had heeded the many signs pointing to another war with germany war they may have acted soon enough to save millions of lives. satan cursed the world with ignorance and by the time the threat of hitler was undoubtedly clear it was too late and the second world war had begun. in mein kampf it as though the devil himself is pouring out evil rhetoric of greed and hatred. satan filled the heart of hitler and overflowed malice upon the entire world flooding the planet with the red tides of bloody ruin. mein kampf is a satanic doctrine of nazi evil filled with the incoherent ramblings of a madman spilling forth malicious contempt and unholy intent. released from prison in  having learned his lesson from the failed revolt hitler had a new plan on toppling the government and seizing control of germany. he planned to play by the democratic rules getting elected gracefully overthrowing the government from the inside. hitler polished his oratorical skills and worked advancement of the nazi party. such advancement was slow in coming through the years  to  a fairly stable period in europe. however as the world became mired in depression and unemployment rose so did support for the nazi party which promised employment and a return to glory for the nation. when the great depression struck in  hitlers explanation of it as a jewish-communist plot was accepted by many germans. promising a strong germany jobs and national glory he attracted millions of voters who elected many nazis to the german reichstag parliament. nazi representation in the reichstag rose from  seats in  to  in  and in  the nazis won . percent of the popular vote and occupied  seats in the german reichstag. there was little stability in the german government around this time and seeking a solution to this instability president paul von hindenburg after hitlers insidious nagging for the position was manipulated by satan to appoint hitler chancellor of germany on january  . hitlers influence over the president turned hindenburg into a nazi puppet signing nearly everything hitler put before him into law. he signed an emergency decree that placed the german state of prussia in the hands of hitler confidant vice chancellor papen. the nazi hermann gring as minister of the interior for prussia took control of the police. prussia was germany's biggest and most important state and included the capital of berlin. gring immediately replaced hundreds of police officials loyal to the republic with nazi officials loyal to hitler. he also ordered the police not to interfere with the sa and ss under any circumstances. this meant that anybody being harassed beaten or even murdered by nazis had nobody to turn to for help. gring then set up an auxiliary police force of  men comprised mostly of members of the sa and ss. suddenly the vulgar brawling murderous nazi storm troopers now had the power and authority of police. satan orchestrated the burning of the reichstag building order to help progress hitlers rise to power. on february   the reichstag building burned down and an allegedly insane dutch man claiming he worked for the communists was arrested for arson. there is evidence to suggest that the nazis themselves had orchestrated the fire but in any case hitler used the incident to persuade president hindenburg to restrict all individual rights and declare that the central government could oust any state government failing to maintain order. hitler systematically took control of all of the state governments this way. hitler's private army the s.a. roamed the streets terrorizing political opponents. even so the nazis only won . percent of the vote in . to gain a two thirds majority hitler formed an alliance with the nationalist party and declared the communist party illegal. the chain of events starting with the reichstag burning drastically helped provided hitler with dictatorship over germany leading to the suppression of all major nazi opposition. on march   the reichstag passed the enabling act giving hitler the power to make decrees with the status of law and ending elections essentially making him a dictator. this would not have happened by then if devil had not caused the burning of the reichstag building which excuse the elimination of nearly all political opposition. then when hitler had the majority of the german reichstag he was able to pass the enabling act giving him total control of germany. when hindenburg died in hitler fused the positions of chancellor and president into office: der fuhrer. he took control as the totalitarian leader of germany. hitler constructed the third reich under his dictatorship using the gestapo the secret police to stifle all dissent. hitler's vague policy included a planned economy in which the unemployed were put to work on government projects working hours were shortened to open up jobs and labour was forbidden to organize. the government oversaw all functions of the economy. all education and speech was controlled. curriculum and textbooks were rewritten to reflect nazi ideology and all movies newspapers radio and art were regulated by the vigilant ministry of propaganda under joseph goebbels. one of the ministry's main tasks was to mobilize german anti-semitism in support of nazi persecution of german jews which would reach its climax in the holocaust begun in  where over  million innocent jews and millions of others seen as racially inferior were thoroughly round up and systematically executed. most germans supported hitler enthusiastically. his armament drive to remilitarize germany eliminated unemployment an ambitious recreational program attracted workers and employees and his foreign policy successes impressed his subjects. he thus managed to forge the german people into the pliable tool he needed to establish german rule over europe and other parts of the world. discrediting the churches with charges of corruption and immorality he imposed his own inhuman moral code. he derided the concept of human equality and claimed racial superiority for the germans. as the master race they were told they had the right to dominate all nations subjected to the german reign. the persecution of the jews was a major step in hitler's plan to conquer all of europe for the aryan race. setting out on his empire-building mission hitler launched germany's open rearmament in  sent troops into the demilitarized rhineland in  and annexed both austria and czechoslovakia's sudetenland in . in march  he brought the remainder of czechoslovakia under german control. he also came to the aid of francisco franco's rebels in spain's civil war . all this was in direct violation of the treaty of the treaty of versailles but the nave league of nations was to fearful of war and no national leader offered resistance to hitlers moves. satans plan for the nazi regime unfolded with its manipulation on all sides of the battle. in the minds of the members of the league of nations and in the minds of hitler and his people the devil pulled strings allowing the rise of the nazi regime imbuing it with power and influence. political passivism and nave ignorance was a dark fog in the midst of the league of nations and this was one of the biggest reasons the second world war was not prevented. an opportunity to defeat hitler early in his campaign to dominate earth was not taken because of the blundering procrastination of the allied league of nations. partly as a result of this inaction the entire world suffered the wrath of the second world war. the second world war was the most deadly destructive and consequential war in history. although the human cost of the war was tremendous casualty figures cannot always be obtained and often widely vary. most experts estimate the military and civilian losses of allied forces at  million and those of the axis at  million. the total number of civilian losses includes the . million to . million jews were killed in the holocaust. civilian deaths in the soviet union alone totalled  million. causes of the war can be traced back to the end of world war i. germany italy and japan suffered deep economic problems. inflation was rampant. however by the late 1920s, economic order was being restored. this trend reversed when the united states entered the great depression. the citizens of what would be the axis powers germany italy and japan supported nationalistic organizations which offered hope in the face of these problems. these organizations soon gave birth to tyranny however. totalitarian dictatorships arose in the soviet union japan italy and germany these were led by josef stalin emperor hirohito benito mussolini and adolf hitler respectively. these leaders seized power by promising reform through unity. under the dictatorships however terror reigned. dictators used secret police threats imprisonment and even executions to eliminate their opposition. some consider the start of world war ii to be japan's invasion of manchuria in  a region in eastern china. japan continued to demonstrate aggression effectively conquering eastern china by . italy meanwhile conquered ethiopia in . germany in  annexed both austria and the sudetenland in czechoslovakia. there was essentially no stopping this aggression since the league of nations lacked the power to enforce its treaties. in  german and italy allied. japan joined in  forming the rome-berlin-tokyo axis. during this time spain was in civil war. general francisco franco led the rebellious army nationalists against spain's government. hitler and mussolini supported the revolution. the spanish civil war divided the world into those who supported nazism and fascism and those who were against it. hitler and british prime minister neville chamberlain held several meetings to restore order and peace. they agreed that if hitler took czechoslovakia he would not try to acquire more territory. hitler defiantly broke his promise by invading poland  months later on september  . germany's blitzkrieg lightning war quickly overcame the large but poorly equipped polish army. the blitzkrieg relied on speed and surprise. it was carried out flawlessly. britain and france pledged their support for the allied cause but stood by while hitler swallowed poland. journalists dubbed this the phony war. german forces then conquered denmark and norway seizing vital ports. following these invasions chamberlain resigned. he was replaced by winston churchill on may  . germany on the same day created another blitzkrieg immediately taking luxembourg belgium and the netherlands. the french hoped to hold off the aggressive germans by use of the maginot line a strip of defence along the french-german border. it proved futile however as the germans simply proceeded around it and into france. the blitzkrieg once again made its appearance this time beginning on june . it proved effective once more. the french signed an armistice on june . france had fallen. in a massive air war the luftwaffe the german air force began to mount assaults on british raf royal air force stations. by september  germany thought it had destroyed the raf so it proceeded to bomb london. this series of attacks on britain's capital was known as the blitz. great britain remained great however and survived germany's most destructive efforts. germany halted its air efforts in may . meanwhile british forces in north africa were fighting to repel the invading italians. britain managed to keep italy out of egypt and pushed them back to libya. in the beginning of  the afrika korps led by general erwin rommel was sent to help the italian forces. rommel's crafty methods eventually earned him the famed moniker the desert fox. britain held on. in may of  britain had regained control of northern africa. in march and april of  the germans quickly captured yugoslavia and greece. when british soldiers retreated to the island of crete germany orchestrated the first ever airborne invasion dropping thousands of paratroopers who quickly took the island. these conquests were an error on hitler's part however. hitler had been planning to invade the soviet union for some time. but with the delays he would now have to fight an extended bitter winter war. operation barbarossa the invasion of the soviet union began on june  . the soviets soon suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. the invasion went well for the germans. this lasted briefly however. instead of taking moscow hitler opted for a dual-flank approach sending some forces north to leningrad and some south towards the black sea. meanwhile the harsh weather began. october rains caught the germans in mud. in early december as german troops began to march into moscow winter began. temperatures fell to . the german advance stopped as abruptly as it began. germany's battleships struggled to cut off allied sea supply routes. but british task forces managed to destroy the bulk of germany's battleship fleet. the largest such attack was against the german navy's pride and joy the bismarck. a fleet of british warships surrounded and sank the bismarck in may of . however the germans still had a trick up their collective sleeve: the u-boat. for two years u-boats sank every allied supply ship they could find. but long-range torpedo bombers warship escorts of supply ships and the new allied technology of sonar curbed the threat of the dreaded unterseeboote. president franklin d. roosevelt hoped to win the war by supplying allied nations with the weapons they needed rather than sending the united states into war. the lend-lease act gave  nations about  billion in u.s. aid. japan stuck in china decided to cut off vital chinese supply lines from southeast asia. japan entered and controlled northern indochina. the u.s. responded by cutting japan's supply of american goods. japan wanted to return to its expansion plans so it turned on the one force that could stop it: the united states navy. on december   a japanese task force attacked the pacific fleet at pearl harbour in hawaii. they sank four battleships and destroyed nearly  aircraft. the next day the u.s. canada and great britain declared war on japan. the soviets in december  recovered and pushed the germans back  miles outside of moscow. in spring  the germans marched towards oil reserves in the caucasus. hitler ordered the capture of stalingrad. a five-month battle ensued. the soviets in a counter-attack captured and killed  german soldiers stopping germany's eastward march. in  allied defeats stopped in europe. in eastern europe the soviets prevented the german advance in eastern europe. soviets defeated the germans in a battle at stalingrad in . the allies were soon on a roll. they won battles in africa and forced italy to surrender in . in  the allies prepared for an invasion in northern france. roosevelt churchill and stalin met together in  in teheran iran to discuss the strategy and plans behind the invasion. they talked to each other about a british and american large-scale attack called operation overlord on the beach of normandy along the northern coast of france. this attack was to be known as the d-day invasion. it will have been the largest seaborne invasion in history. hitler laughed and said his forces could resist any attack on the coast. the invasion would deploy allied soldiers ashore on five beaches under the code names of utah omaha gold juno and sword. the germans were not sure what beach the allies were going to attack so they built a chain of fortifications along the coast called the atlantic wall. hitler left general rommel in charge to strengthen there defences. rommel put up barbed wire he mined the water and concentrated his troops near the calais the narrowest part of the english channel. on june 6th,  allied ships carrying  soldiers led by general dwight eisenhower crossed the english channel. paratroops were dropped off behind enemy lines to capture bridges and railroad tracks. d-day caught the germans by surprise. germans fought fiercely but did not win the battle. the allies built a temporary harbour to receive supplies and a pipeline across the british channel for oil. near the end of june about a million troops had accumulated in france. the allies advanced slowly in the beginning. the americans fought and capture cherbourg on june  and the british and canadian forces fought and captured caen on july . the allied forces had finally reached open country. on july   bombers blasted a hole in the german front near st-lo. lieutenant general george patton plowed through the gap and exterminated the germans from northwest france. patton ordered his army toward paris. on august   parisians heard the news and rose up against the german troops occupying paris. the german troops in paris were ordered by hitler to destroy paris but they delayed and the allies reached paris on august 25th to liberate france. slowly the allied forces moved toward germany. the german generals knew they were beat and tried to tell hitler but he brought together his remaining forces for one last attack at the ardennes forest belgium amp luxembourg. he won this battle of the bulge however in two weeks the americans stopped the german advance near the meuse river belgium. meanwhile the soviets had slowly pushed back the germans after the battle at stalingrad. the soviets were producing and importing war supplies from britain and america preparing for another offensive by the germans at kursk. the soviet forces waited for them with tanks mines anti-tank guns and aircraft completely obliterating the oncoming german troops and tanks. the rest of the  german tanks were ordered to retreat during the battle. the soviet forces then moved toward leningrad. they defeated the germans there and move onward to poland. when they reach the outskirts of warsaw stalin refused to come to polish aid resulting in a german onslaught of  polish soldiers. afterwards the soviets entered in and destroyed the germans in . another series of soviet troops began to move towards hungary crushing all german forces in their path. soviet troops reached budapest and drove the german forces out in february of . after their strong advance the soviets had occupied almost all of eastern europe. the allies began their final assault in . soviet forces were advancing from the east to berlin british and canadian forces came from the north and american and french forces neared central germany. in all the allies had almost surrounded the germans. prior to closing in on the germans those allies passing through previously occupied areas were terrified at the sights at the concentration camps. hitler committed suicide before the allied forces took berlin. on may   colonel general alfred doenitz hitler's replacement signed a declaration of unconditional surrender ending the war in europe. the war with the japanese was a personal vendetta for the u.s. after japan bombed pearl harbour on december  . japan won several early victories including: taking over hong kong guam and wake island defeating the british in singapore the battle of the java sea and the conquest of the philippines. macarthur's troops were ordered to australia after leaving the philippines in march . on april  about  exhausted troops on bataan surrendered to the japanese. most of them were forced to march  miles to prison camps but most of them died. this march was called the bataan death march. after the philippines were captured japan moved toward india and australia. in  there were  events that helped turn the tide on the japanese. one of them was the doolittle raid in which  b bombers surprised tokyo with minor bombing. the 2nd event was the battle of the coral sea which halted the japanese attack on port moresby. the rd event was the battle of midway in which japan sent a large fleet to capture one of the hawaiian islands but the americans intercepted the plan and prepared for a surprise attack. the battle began on june   when the japanese bombed the island of midway. old u.s. bombers launched bombers on japanese warships but most of them were shot down. next american dive bombers dropped down on japanese aircraft carriers while they were refuelling. the e japanese had lost  aircraft carriers and at least  planes along with many skilled pilots. japan had only sunk  u.s. aircraft carrier and shot down  planes. the battle of midway was a clear victory for the allies. meanwhile the allies battled to regain most of the islands in the pacific. in  macarthur attacked new guinea with a series of brilliant operations but fighting continued until . on august   marines invaded guadalcanal. this attack caught the japanese by surprise but they fought strong. this battle proved to be one of the most vicious campaigns in wwii. by february  japan left guadalcanal. in  allied military leaders cancelled the invasion of rabaul instead they bombed it. after beating back the japanese the allies finally liberated the philippines in . superiority in air and sea combat enabled the allies to move onto japan itself. allied forces first attack iwo jima. the marines landed on february  . the marines successfully won the battle but with a struggle. okinawa was the next stop. japan sent kamikazes to attack the marine landing force but they still defeated japan at okinawa. on august   due their refusal to give into the us's ultimatum the b american bomber the enola gay dropped the first atomic bomb on hiroshima. three days later america dropped another atomic bomb on nagasaki after japanese leaders failed to respond to the first bombing. on september   japan finally gave in and signed a statement of surrender ending wwii. world war ii qualifies as by far the most costly war in history in terms of human casualties and material resources expended. in all  countries with . billion people three-fourths of the worlds population took part. a total of  million people were mobilized for military service more than half of those by three countries: the ussr  million to  million germany  million and the united states  million. for the major participants the largest numbers on duty at any one time were as follows: ussr  united states  germany  british empire and commonwealth  japan  and china . most statistics on the war are only estimates. the wars vast and chaotic sweep made uniform record keeping impossible. some governments lost control of the data and some resorted to manipulating it for political reasons. a rough consensus has been reached on the total cost of the war. the human cost estimated at  million dead million in the military and  million civilians. the amount of money spent has been estimated at more than  trillion which makes world war ii more expensive than all other wars combined. the holocaust was the systematic bureaucratic annihilation of six million jews and millions of non jews by the nazi regime and their collaborators as a central act of state during world war ii. it was a premier example of ruthless malice leading to the utter destruction of immense multitudes of innocent men women and children. in  approximately nine million jews lived the  countries of europe that would be occupied by germany during the war. by  two out of every three european jews had been killed. although jews were the primary victims hundreds of thousands of roma gypsies and at least  mentally or physically disabled people were also victims of nazi genocide. as nazi tyranny spread across europe from  to  millions of other innocent people were persecuted and murdered. more than three million soviet prisoners of war were killed because of their nationality. poles as well as other slavs were targeted for slave labour and as a result almost two million perished. homosexuals and others deemed anti-social were also persecuted and often murdered. in addition thousands of political and religious dissidents such as communists socialists trade unionists and jehovah's witnesses were persecuted for their beliefs and behaviour and many of these individuals died as a result of maltreatment. the concentration camp is most closely associated with the holocaust and remains an enduring symbol of the nazi regime. the first camps opened soon after the nazis took power in january  they continued as a basic part of nazi rule until may   when the war and the nazi regime ended. for many centuries christians in europe discriminated against jews. many harboured a prejudice against jews that is known as anti-semitism. some scholars view anti-semitism as a religious prejudice. others regard it as an anti-jewish variety of a general hatred directed against ethnic minorities. in the minds of anti-semites jews represent mysterious mythical and evil forces are all-powerful and play a sinister role in world history. in the middle ages christian anti-jewish preaching sought to prevent contacts with jews and many christians believed that jews were in league with the devil. christians blamed the jews for the crucifixion of jesus christ. many believed that jews were not human and that they used magic to appear like other people. all these beliefs merged with popular superstitions about the magical power of human blood sorcery and perversity giving rise to the blood libelthe false accusation that jews used the blood of christian children in their rituals. such stereotypes of the jews interacted in the minds of many europeans with fear of foreigners and combined with economic and social frictions. as a result anti-jewish violence frequently erupted. the christian church and various governments enacted laws that prohibited jews from engaging in certain occupations forced them to live in certain areas kept them from attending universities or even expelled them from various countries. for many centuries the roman catholic church taught anti-jewish beliefs and attitudes. the anti-jewish teachings of the catholic church did not advocate the killing of jews. however the propagation of hatred insults degradation and often demonization of jews induced many catholics to accept anti-semitic measures when the nazis and their collaborators introduced them in the 20th century. the same was true of protestant churches. the pamphlet on the jews and their lies written by german religious reformer martin luther in  used extremely violent language. it called on christians to set synagogues on fire to destroy houses and to put jews in stables and it advised rulers to banish jews from their countries. luthers writings had a significant influence on german protestant theologians and also contributed to a climate of opinion that condoned or approved persecution of jews. the events of the holocaust occurred in two main phases:  and . on january   adolf hitler was named chancellor the most powerful position in the german government by the aged president hindenburg who hoped hitler could lead the nation out of its grave political and economic crisis. hitler was the leader of the right-wing national socialist german workers party called the nazi party for short it was by  one of the strongest parties in germany even though  reflecting the country's multi-party system  the nazis had only won a plurality of  percent of the votes in the  elections to the german parliament reichstag. once in power hitler moved quickly to end german democracy. he convinced his cabinet to invoke emergency clauses of the constitution which permitted the suspension of individual freedoms of the press speech and assembly. special security forces  the special state police the gestapo the storm troopers s.a. and the security police s.s.  murdered or arrested leaders of opposition political parties communists socialists and liberals. the enabling act of march   forced through a reichstag already purged of many political opponents gave dictatorial powers to hitler. also in  the nazis began to put into practice their racial ideology. echoing ideas popular in germany as well as most other western nations well before the 1930s, the nazis believed that the germans were racially superior and that there was a struggle for survival between them and inferior races. they saw jews roma gypsies and the handicapped as a serious biological threat to the purity of the german aryan race what they called the master race. jews who numbered around  in germany less than one percent of the total population in  were the principal target of nazi hatred. the nazis mistakenly identified jews as a race and defined this race as inferior. they also spewed hatemongering propaganda which unfairly blamed jews for germany's economic depression and the country's defeat in world war i . in  new german laws forced jews to quit their civil service jobs university and law court positions and other areas of public life. in april  a boycott of businesses was instituted. in laws proclaimed at nuremberg stripped german jews their citizenship even though they retained limited rights. these nuremberg laws defined jews not by their religion by how they wanted to identify themselves but by the blood of their grandparents. between  and  new anti-jewish regulations segregated jews further and made daily life very difficult for them: jews could not attend public schools go to theatres cinemas or vacation resorts or reside or even walk in certain sections of german cities. also between  and  jews were forced from germany's economic life: the nazis either seized businesses and properties outright or forced to sell them at bargain prices. in november  this economic attack against german and austrian jews changed into the physical destruction synagogues and jewish-owned stores the arrest of jewish men the destruction of homes and the murder of individuals. this centrally organized riot pogrom kristallnacht the night of broken glass. kristallnacht refers to the shattered glass that was left after that night of savage violence. the pretext for this first mass outburst of anti-semitic hysteria in germany was the assassination in paris of a german diplomat ernst vom rath by a young german jew hirsch grynszpan. grynszpan was enraged by the deportation of his parents from germany to poland by the ss the elite military force within the nazi party. the assassination took place in early november. although jews were the main target of nazi hatred the nazis persecuted other groups viewed as racially or genetically inferior. nazi racial ideology was buttressed by scientists who advocated selective breeding eugenics to improve the human race. laws passed between  and  aimed to reduce the future number of genetic inferiors through involuntary sterilization programs: about  children of mixed racial backgrounds and  to  individuals judged physically or mentally handicapped were subjected to surgical or radiation procedures so they could not have children. supporters of sterilization also argued the handicapped burdened the community with the costs of their care. many of germany's  gypsies were also eventually sterilized and prohibited along with blacks from intermarrying with germans. reflecting traditional prejudices new laws combined traditional prejudices with the new racism of the nazis which defined gypsies by race as criminal and asocial. another consequence of hitler's ruthless dictatorship in the 1930s arrest of political opponents and trade unionists and others the nazis labelled undesirables and enemies of the state. many homosexuals mostly male were arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps under the  nazi-revised criminal code the mere denunciation of an individual as homosexual could result in arrest trial and conviction. jehovah's witnesses were banned as an organization as early as april  since the beliefs of this religious group prohibited them from swearing any oath to the state serving in the german military. their literature was confiscated and they lost jobs unemployment benefits pensions and all social welfare benefits. many witnesses were sent to prisons and concentration camps in nazi germany and their children were sent to juvenile detention homes and orphanages. between  and  thousands of people mostly political prisoners and jehovah's witnesses were imprisoned in concentration camps while several thousand german gypsies were confined in special municipal camps. the first systematic round-ups of german and austrian jews occurred after kristallnacht when approximately  jewish men were deported to dachau and other concentration camps and several hundred jewish women were sent to local jails. at the end of  the waves of arrests also included several thousand german and austrian gypsies. between  and  about half the german jewish population and more than two-thirds of austrian jews  fled nazi persecution. they emigrated mainly to palestine the united states latin america china which required no visa for entry and eastern and western europe where many would be caught again in the nazi net during the war. jews who remained under nazi rule were either unwilling to uproot themselves or unable to obtain visas sponsors in host countries or funds for emigration. most foreign countries including the united states canada britain and france were unwilling to admit very large numbers of refugees. on september   germany invaded poland and world war ii began. within one month the polish army was defeated and the nazis began their campaign to destroy polish culture and enslave the polish people whom they viewed as subhuman. killing polish leaders was the first step: german soldiers carried out massacres of university professors artists writers politicians and many catholic priests. to create new living space for the superior germanic race large segments of the polish population were resettled and german families moved into the emptied lands. thousands of other poles including jews were imprisoned in concentration camps. the nazis also kidnapped as many as  aryan-looking polish children from their parents and took them to germany to be adopted by german families. many of these children were later rejected as not capable of germanization and sent to special children's camps where some died of starvation lethal injection and disease. as the war began in  hitler initialled an order to kill institutionalized handicapped patients deemed incurable. special commissions of physicians reviewed questionnaires filled out by all state hospitals and then decided if a patient should be killed. the doomed were then transferred to six institutions in germany and austria where specially constructed gas chambers were used to kill them. after public protests in  the nazi leadership continued this euphemistically termed euthanasia program in secret. babies small children and other victims were thereafter killed by lethal injection and pills and by forced starvation. the euthanasia program contained all the elements later required for mass murder of european jews and gypsies in nazi death camps: an articulated decision to kill specially trained personnel the apparatus for killing by gas and the use of euphemistic language like euthanasia which psychologically distanced the murderers from their victims and hid the criminal character of the killings from the public. in  german forces continued their conquest of much of europe easily defeating denmark norway holland belgium luxembourg and france. on june   the german army invaded the soviet union and by september was approaching moscow. in the meantime italy romania and hungary had joined the axis powers led by germany and opposed by the allied powers british commonwealth free france the united states and the soviet union. in the months following germany's invasion of the soviet union jews political leaders communists and many gypsies were killed in mass executions. the overwhelming those killed were jews. these murders were carried out at improvised sites throughout the soviet union by members of mobile killing squads einsatzgruppen who followed in the wake of the invading germany army. the most famous of these sites was babi yar near kiev where an estimated  persons mostly were murdered. german terror extended to institutionalized handicapped psychiatric patients in the soviet union it also resulted in the mass murder of more than three million soviet prisoners war. world war ii brought major changes to concentration camp system. large numbers new prisoners deported all german-occupied countries now flooded camps. often entire groups committed the camps members of underground resistance organizations who were rounded up in a sweep across western europe under the  night and fog decree. to accommodate the massive increase in the number of prisoners hundreds of new camps were established in occupied territories of eastern and western europe. during the war ghettos transit camps and forced labour camps in addition to the concentration camps were created by the germans and their collaborators to imprison jews gypsies and other victims of racial and ethnic hatred as well as political opponents and resistance fighters. following the invasion of poland three million polish jews were forced into approximately  newly established ghettos where they were segregated from the rest of the population. large numbers of jews were also deported from other cities and countries including germany to ghettos in poland and german-occupied territories further east. in polish cities under nazi occupation like warsaw and lodz jews were confined in sealed ghettos where starvation overcrowding exposure to cold and contagious diseases killed tens of thousands of people. in warsaw and elsewhere ghettoized jews made every effort often at great risk to maintain their cultural communal and religious lives. the ghettos also provided a forced labour pool for the germans and many forced labourers who worked on road gangs in construction other hard labour related to the german war effort died from exhaustion or maltreatment. between  and  the germans moved to eliminate the ghettos in occupied poland and elsewhere deporting ghetto residents to extermination camps killing centers equipped with gassing facilities located in poland. after the meeting of senior german government officials in late january  at a villa in the berlin suburb of wannsee the decision to implement the final solution of the jewish question became formal state policy and jews from western europe were also sent to killing centers in the east. the six killing sites were chosen because of their closeness to rail lines and their location in semi-rural areas at belzec sobibor treblinka chelmno majdanek and auschwitz-birkenau. chelmno was the first camp in which mass executions were carried out by gas piped into mobile gas vans  persons were killed there between december  and march  and june to july . a killing center using gas vans and later gas chambers operated at belzec where more than  persons were killed between may  and august . sobibor opened in may  and closed one day after a rebellion of the prisoners on october   up to  persons were killed by gassing. treblinka opened in july  and closed in november  a revolt by the prisoners in early august  destroyed much of the facility. at least  persons were killed at treblinka physically the largest of the killing centers. almost all of the victims at chelmno belzec sobibor and treblinka were jews a few were gypsies. very few individuals survived these four killing centers where most victims were murdered immediately after arrival. auschwitz-birkenau which also served concentration camp slave labour camp became the killing center where the largest numbers of jews and gypsies were killed. after an experimental gassing there september  of  malnourished and ill polish prisoners and  russian pows mass murder became a daily routine more than . million were killed at auschwitz birkenau  out of  were jews. in addition gypsies soviet pows and ill prisoners of all nationalities died in gas chambers. between may  and july    hungarian jews were deported to auschwitz in  trains. this was probably the largest single mass deportation during the holocaust. a similar system was implemented at majdanek which also doubled concentration camp and where at least  persons were killed in the gas chambers or died from malnutrition brutality and disease. the methods of murder were the same in all the killing centers which were operated by the s.s. the victims arrived in railroad freight cars and passenger trains mostly from ghettos and camps in occupied poland but also from almost every other eastern and western european country. on arrival men were separated from women and children. prisoners were forced to undress and hand over all valuables. they were then driven naked into the gas chambers which were disguised shower rooms either carbon monoxide zyklon b crystalline prussic acid insecticide in some camps was used to asphyxiate them. the minority selected for forced labour were after initial quarantine vulnerable to malnutrition exposure epidemics medical experiments and brutality many perished as a result. the germans carried out their systematic murderous activities with the active help of local collaborators in many countries and the acquiescence or indifference of millions of bystanders. however there were instances of organized resistance. for example in the fall of  the danish resistance with the support of the local population rescued nearly the entire jewish community in denmark from the threat of deportation to the east smuggling them via a dramatic boatlift safety in neutral sweden. individuals in many other countries also risked their lives to save jews and other individuals subject to nazi persecution. one of the most famous was raoul wallenberg a swedish diplomat who led the rescue effort which saved the lives of tens of thousands of hungarian jews in . resistance movements existed in almost every concentration camp and ghetto of europe. in addition to the armed revolts at sobibor and treblinka jewish resistance in the warsaw ghetto led to a courageous uprising in april-may  despite a predictable doomed outcome because of superior german force. in general rescue or aid to holocaust victims was not a priority of resistance organizations whose principal goal was to fight the war against the germans. nonetheless such groups and jewish partisans resistance fighters sometimes cooperated with each other to save jews. on april   for instance members of the national committee for the defense of jews in cooperation with christian railroad workers and the general underground in belgium attacked a train leaving the belgian transit camp of malines headed for auschwitz and succeeded in assisting several hundred jewish deportees to escape. after the war turned against germany and the allied armies approached german soil in late  the s.s. decided to evacuate outlying concentration camps. the germans tried to cover up the evidence of genocide and deported prisoners to camps inside germany to prevent their liberation. many inmates died during the long journeys on foot known as death marches. during the final days in the spring of  conditions in the remaining concentration camps exacted a terrible toll in human lives. even concentration camps never intended for extermination such as bergen-belsen became death traps for thousands including anne frank who died there of typhus in march . in may  nazi germany collapsed the s.s. guards fled and the camps ceased to exist as extermination forced labor or concentration camps. however some of the concentration camps were turned into camps for displaced persons dps which included former holocaust victims. nutrition sanitary conditions and accommodations often were poor. dps lived behind barbed wire and were exposed to humiliating treatment and at times to anti-semitic attacks. the nazi legacy was a vast empire of murder pillage and exploitation that had affected every country of occupied europe. the toll in lives was enormous. the full magnitude and the moral and ethical implications of this tragic era are only now to be understood fully.

verbal or nonverbal so long as a being transmits a thought provoking idea gesture action etc. . . communication can be defined as the process of meaningful interaction among human beings. it is the act of passing information and the process by which meanings are exchanged so as to produce understanding. communication is the process by which any message is given or received through talking writing or making gestures. there are auditory means such as speaking singing and sometimes tone of voice and nonverbal physical means such as body language sign language paralanguage eye contact or the use of writing. communication happens at many levels even for one single action in many different ways and for most beings as well as certain machines. several if not all fields of study dedicate a portion of attention to communication so when speaking about communication it is very important to be sure about what aspects of communication one is speaking about. definitions of communication range widely some recognizing that animals can communicate with each other as well as human beings and some are more narrow only including human beings within the parameters of human symbolic interaction. nonetheless communication is usually described along a few major dimensions:  content what type of things are communicated  by whom  form in which form  channel through which medium  to whom between parties communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences give advice and commands and ask questions. these acts may take many forms in one of the various manners of communication. the form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. together communication content and form make messages that are sent towards a destination. the target can be oneself another interpersonal or being another entity such as a corporation or group of beings. depending on the focus who what in which form to whom to which effect there exist various classifications. some of those systematical questions are elaborated in communication theory. communication as information transmission communication: transmitting a message with the expectation of some kind of response. this can be interpersonal or intrapersonal. communication can be seen as processes of information transmission governed by three levels of semiotic rules: syntactic formal properties of signs and symbols pragmatic concerned with the relations between and their users and semantic study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent. therefore communication is social interaction where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of semiotic rules. this commonly held rule in some sense ignores autocommunication including intrapersonal communication via or self-talk. image:communication major dimensions code in a simple model information or content e.g. a message in natural language is sent in some form as spoken language from an encoder to a decoder. in a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked a particular instance of communication is called a speech act. in the presence of noise on the transmission channel air in this case reception and decoding of content may be faulty and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. dialogue is a form of communication in which both the parties are involved in sending and receiving information. theories of coregulation describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process rather than a discrete exchange of information. nonverbal communication is the act of imparting or interchanging thoughts posture opinions or information without the use of words using gestures sign language facial expressions and body language instead. information exchange between living organisms communication in many of its facets is not limited to humans or even to primates. every information exchange between living organisms  i.e. transmission of signals involving a living sender and receiver information  can be considered a form of communication. thus there is the broad field of animal communication which encompasses most of the issues in ethology. on a more basic level there is cell signaling cellular communication communication and chemical communication between primitive organisms like bacteria and within the plant and kingdoms. all of these communication processes are sign-mediated interactions with a great variety of distinct coordinations. animal communication is any behaviour on the part of one animal that has an effect on the current or future behavior of another animal. of course human communication can be subsumed as a highly developed form of animal communication. the study of animal communication called zoosemiotics distinguishable from anthroposemiotics the study of human communication has played an important part in the development of ethology sociobiology and the study of animal cognition. this is quite evident as humans are able to communicate with animals especially dolphins and other animals used in circuses however these animals have to learn a special means of communication. plant communication is observed a within the plant organism i.e. within plant cells and between plant cells b between plants of the same or related species and c between plants and non-plant organisms especially in the rootzone. plant roots communicate in parallel with rhizobia bacteria with fungi and with insects in the soil. this parallel sign mediated interactions which are governed by syntactic pragmatic and semantic rules are possible because of the decentralized nervous system of plants. as recent research shows  of intraorganismic plant communication processes are neuronal-like. plants also communicate via volatiles in the case of herbivory attack behavior to warn neighboring plants. in parallel they produce other volatiles which attract parasites which attack these herbivores. in plant situations plants can overwrite the genetic code they inherited from their parents and revert to that of their grand or great-grandparents. there are communication processes between different species of bacteria and between bacteria and non bacterial life such as eukaryotic hosts. beneath the semiochemicals necessary for developmental processes of bacterial communities such as division sporulation and synthesis of secondary metabolites there are physical contact-mediated behavioral patterns being important in biofilm organisation. there are three classes of signalling molecules for different purposes i.e. signalling within the organism to coordinate gene expressions to generate adequate response behavior signalling between same or related and different species. the most popular communicative behavior is quorum sensing. quorum sensing is the term for description of sign-mediated interactions in which chemical molecules are produced and secreted by bacteria. they are recognized of the bacterial community dependent on a critical concentration and in a special ratio to the population density. these molecules trigger the expression of a great variety of gene transcriptions. the semiochemicals used by bacteria are of great variety especially because some signalling molecules are multiple re-usable components. today three kinds of communicative goals are distinguished: a reciprocal communication active sign-mediated interactions which is beneficial for both interacting parts b messages which are produced as response on a triggering event which may be an indicator for a receiver which was not specially targeted by the producer. a coincidental event which is neutral  except of the energy costs of production  to the producer but beneficial for the receiver c signalling to manipulate the receiver i.e. to cause a response behavior which is onesided beneficial to the producer and harms the receivers often in that they behave against their normal goals. the three classes of bacteria communication enable bacteria to generate and coordinate different behavioral patterns: self and non-self identification i.e. identification of other colonies and measurement of their size pheromone based courtship for mating alteration of colony structure in formatting of fruiting bodies initiation of developmental and growth processes e.g. sporulation.ltrefgtjoint ian downie j. a. amp williams paul . bacterial conversations: talking listening and eavesdropping. philosophical transactions of the royal society b biological sciences  fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their own growth and development such as the formation of mycelia and fruiting bodies. additionally fungi communicate with same and related species as well as with nonfungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions especially with bacteria unicellular eukaryotes plants and insects. the used semiochemicals are of biotic origin and they trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner in difference while to even the same chemical molecules are not being a part of biotic messages doesnt trigger to react the fungal organism. it means fungal organisms are competent to identify the difference of the same molecules being part of biotic messages or lack of these features. so far five different primary signalling molecules are known that serve to coordinate very different behavioral patterns such as filamentation mating growth pathogenicity. behavioral coordination and the production of such substances can only be achieved through interpretation processes: self or non-self abiotic indicator biotic message from similar related or non-related species or even noise i.e. similar molecules without biotic content. a language is a organized system of signals such as voice sounds intonations or pitch gestures or symbols which communicate thoughts or feelings. if a language is about communicating with signals voice sounds gestures or written symbols can animal communications be considered as a language? animals do not have a written form of a language but use a language to communicate with each another. in that sense an animal communication can be considered as a separated language. human spoken and written languages can be described as a system of symbols sometimes known as lexemes and the grammars by which the symbols are manipulated. the word language is also used to refer to common properties of languages. language learning is normal in human childhood. most human languages use patterns of sound or gesture for symbols which enable communication with others around them. there are thousands of human languages and these seem to share certain properties even though many shared properties have exceptions. there is dialect.dialect. or defined line between a language and a dialect but linguist max weinreich is credited as saying that a language is a dialect with an army and a navy.lt!- this in-joke needs explanation for many readers -gt constructed languages such as esperanto programming languages and various mathematical formalisms are not necessarily restricted to the properties shared by human languages. this theory has  stages . use eye contact all the above about egan's solar theory comes from health and social care advanced level published in  by heinmann written by n.moomie the beginning of human communication through artificial channels i.e. not vocalization or gestures goes back to ancient cave paintings drawn maps and writing. our indebtedness to the ancient romans in the field of communication does not end with the latin root communicare. they devised what might be described as the first real mail or postal system in order to centralize control of the roman from rome. this allowed for personal letters and for rome to gather knowledge about events in its many widespread provinces. the adoption of a dominant communication medium is important enough that historians have folded civilization into ages according to the medium most widely used. a book titled five epochs of civilization by william mcgaughey thistlerose  divides history into the following stages: ideographic writing produced the first civilization alphabetic writing the second printing the third electronic recording and broadcasting the fourth and computer communication the fifth. the media affects what people think about themselves and how they perceive people as well. what we think about self image and what others should look like comes from the media. while it could be argued that these epochs are just a historian's construction digital and computer communication shows concrete evidence of changing the way humans organize. the latest trend in communication termed smart involves ad-hoc organization through mobile devices allowing for effective many-to-many communication and social networking. in the last century a revolution in telecommunications has greatly altered communication by providing new media for long distance communication. the reginald aubrey transatlantic two-way radio broadcast occurred in  and led to common communication via analogue and digital media: analog telecommunications include traditional telephony radio and broadcasts. digital telecommunications allow for computer-mediated communication telegraphy and computer networks. communications media impact more than the reach of messages. they impact content and customs for example thomas edison had to discover that hello was the least ambiguous greeting by voice over a distance previous greetings such as hail tended to be garbled in the transmission. similarly the terseness of e-mail and chat rooms produced the need for the emoticon. modern communication media now allow for intense long-distance exchanges between larger numbers of people many-to-many communication via e-mail internet forums. on the other hand many traditional broadcast media and mass media favor one-to-many communication television radio newspaper magazines. for effective communication in specialized contexts certain strategies can be taken that will help people achieve their goals and can be seen as techniques for attaining the purpose of communication. below is a list with explanations of communication strategies used in marketing and selling: adaptive innovation: building or improving products services and processes while working with a customer versus building products or services outside a customer engagement. relates to service companies working with large enterprises. entrepreneurial management: describes a business where the employees are expected to work and relate to each other as self driven business partners versus expecting to be mentored by a command and control management structure. this assumes the phrase be the leader you seek. one voice:a skill used to manage customer team meetings where one person is designated the leader and other team members direct all their comments and questions through the designated onevoice speaker rather than to the customers. showtime: a term related to business people being on stage at all times during a meeting or customer visit. strategic speed: a term related to working fast and smart constantly looking for opportunities to improve and innovate. discipline of dialogue: a term related to controlling your words and conversations during a business meeting or presentation. soler egan  is a technique used by care workers. it helps clients or patients to feel safe and to trust the care-giver and assists in

other animals used in circuses however these animals have to learn a special means of communication. plant communication is observed a within the plant organism i.e. within plant cells and between plant cells b between plants of the same or related species and c between plants and non-plant organisms especially in the rootzone. plant roots communicate in parallel with rhizobia bacteria with fungi and with insects in the soil. this parallel sign mediated interactions which are governed by syntactic pragmatic and semantic rules are possible because of the decentralized nervous system of plants. as recent research shows  of intraorganismic plant communication processes are neuronal-like. plants also communicate via volatiles in the case of herbivory attack behavior to warn neighboring plants. in parallel they produce other volatiles which attract parasites which attack these herbivores. in plant situations plants can overwrite the genetic code they inherited from their parents and revert to that of their grand or great-grandparents. there are communication processes between different species of bacteria and between bacteria and non bacterial life such as eukaryotic hosts. beneath the semiochemicals necessary for developmental processes of bacterial communities such as division sporulation and synthesis of secondary metabolites there are physical contact-mediated behavioral patterns being important in biofilm organisation. there are three classes of signalling molecules for different purposes i.e. signalling within the organism to coordinate gene expressions to generate adequate response behavior signalling between same or related and different species. the most popular communicative behavior is quorum sensing. quorum sensing is the term for description of sign-mediated interactions in which chemical molecules are produced and secreted by bacteria. they are recognized of the bacterial community dependent on a critical concentration and in a special ratio to the population density. these molecules trigger the expression of a great variety of gene transcriptions. the semiochemicals used by bacteria are of great variety especially because some signalling molecules are multiple re-usable components. today three kinds of communicative goals are distinguished: a reciprocal communication active sign-mediated interactions which is beneficial for both interacting parts b messages which are produced as response on a triggering event which may be an indicator for a receiver which was not specially targeted by the producer. a coincidental event which is neutral  except of the energy costs of production  to the producer but beneficial for the receiver c signalling to manipulate the receiver i.e. to cause a response behavior which is onesided beneficial to the producer and harms the receivers often in that they behave against their normal goals. the three classes of bacteria communication enable bacteria to generate and coordinate different behavioral patterns: self and non-self identification i.e. identification of other colonies and measurement of their size pheromone based courtship for mating alteration of colony structure in formatting of fruiting bodies initiation of developmental and growth processes e.g. sporulation.ltrefgtjoint ian downie j. a. amp williams paul . bacterial conversations: talking listening and

fruiting bodies. additionally fungi communicate with same and related species as well as with nonfungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions especially with bacteria unicellular eukaryotes plants and insects. the used semiochemicals are of biotic origin and they trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner in difference while to even the same chemical molecules are not being a part of biotic messages doesnt trigger to react the fungal organism. it means fungal organisms are competent to identify the difference of the same molecules being part of biotic messages or lack of these features. so far five different primary signalling molecules are known that serve to coordinate very different behavioral patterns such as filamentation mating growth pathogenicity. behavioral coordination and the production of such substances can only be achieved through interpretation processes: self or non-self abiotic indicator biotic message from similar related or non-related species or even noise i.e. similar molecules without biotic content. a language is a organized system of signals such as voice sounds intonations or pitch gestures or symbols which communicate thoughts or feelings. if a language is about communicating with signals voice sounds gestures or written symbols can animal communications be considered as a language? animals do not have a written form of a language but use a language to communicate with each another. in that sense an animal communication can be considered as a separated language. human spoken and written languages can be described as a system of symbols sometimes known as lexemes and the grammars by which the symbols are manipulated. the word language is also used to refer to common properties of languages. language learning is normal in human childhood. most human languages use patterns of sound or gesture for symbols which enable communication with others around them. there are thousands of human languages and these seem to share certain properties even though many shared properties have exceptions. there is dialect.dialect. or defined line between a language and a dialect but linguist max weinreich is credited as saying that a language is a dialect with an army and a navy.lt!- this in-joke needs explanation for many readers -gt constructed languages such as esperanto programming languages and various mathematical formalisms are not necessarily restricted to the properties shared by human languages. this theory has  stages . use eye contact all the above about egan's solar theory comes from health and social care advanced level published in  by heinmann written by n.moomie the beginning of human communication through artificial channels i.e. not vocalization or gestures goes back to ancient cave paintings drawn maps and writing. our indebtedness to the ancient romans in the field of communication does not end with the latin root communicare. they devised what might be described as the first real mail or postal system in order to centralize control of the roman from rome. this allowed for personal letters and for rome to gather knowledge about events in its many widespread provinces. the adoption of a dominant communication medium is important enough that historians have folded civilization into ages according to the medium most widely used. a book titled five epochs of civilization by william mcgaughey thistlerose  divides history into the following stages: ideographic writing produced the first civilization alphabetic writing the second printing the third electronic recording and broadcasting the fourth and computer communication the fifth. the media affects what people think about themselves and how they perceive people as well. what we think about self image and what others should look like comes from the media. while it could be argued that these epochs are just a historian's construction digital and computer communication shows concrete evidence of changing the way humans organize. the latest trend in communication termed smart involves ad-hoc organization through mobile devices allowing for effective many-to-many communication and social networking. in the last century a revolution in telecommunications has greatly altered communication by providing new media for long distance communication. the reginald aubrey transatlantic two-way radio broadcast occurred in  and led to common communication via analogue and digital media: analog telecommunications include traditional telephony radio and broadcasts. digital telecommunications allow for computer-mediated communication telegraphy and computer networks. communications media impact more than the reach of messages. they impact content and customs for example thomas edison had to discover that hello was the least ambiguous greeting by voice over a distance previous greetings such as hail tended to be garbled in the transmission. similarly the terseness of e-mail and chat rooms produced the need for the emoticon. modern communication media now allow for intense long-distance exchanges between larger numbers of people many-to-many communication via e-mail internet forums. on the other hand many traditional broadcast media and mass media favor one-to-many communication television radio newspaper magazines. for effective communication in specialized contexts certain strategies can be taken that will help people achieve their goals and can be seen as techniques for attaining the purpose of communication. below is a list with explanations of communication strategies used in marketing and selling: adaptive innovation: building or improving products services and processes while working with a customer versus building products or services outside a customer engagement. relates to service companies working with large enterprises. entrepreneurial management: describes a business where the employees are expected to work and relate to each other as self driven business partners versus expecting to be mentored by a command and control management structure. this assumes the phrase be the leader you seek. one voice:a skill used to manage customer team meetings where one person is designated the leader and other team members direct all their comments and questions through the designated onevoice speaker rather than to the customers. showtime: a term related to business people being on stage at all times during a meeting or customer visit. strategic speed: a term related to working fast and smart constantly looking for opportunities to improve and innovate. discipline of dialogue: a term related to controlling your words and conversations during a business meeting or presentation. soler egan

communication is the articulation of sending a message whether it be verbal or nonverbal so long as a being transmits a thought provoking idea gesture action etc. . . communication can be defined as the process of meaningful interaction among human beings. it is the act of passing information and the process by which meanings are exchanged so as to produce understanding. communication is the process by which any message is given or received through talking writing or making gestures. there are auditory means such as speaking singing and sometimes tone of voice and nonverbal physical means such as body language sign language paralanguage eye contact or the use of writing. communication happens at many levels even for one single action in many different ways and for most beings as well as certain machines. several if not all fields of study dedicate a portion of attention to communication so when speaking about communication it is very important to be sure about what aspects of communication one is speaking about. definitions of communication range widely some recognizing that animals can communicate with each other as well as human beings and some are more narrow only including human beings within the parameters of human symbolic interaction. nonetheless communication is usually described along a few major dimensions:  content what type of things are communicated  by whom  form in which form  channel through which medium  to whom between parties communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences give advice and commands and ask questions. these acts may take many forms in one of the various manners of communication. the form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. together communication content and form make messages that are sent towards a destination. the target can be oneself another interpersonal or being another entity such as a corporation or group of beings. depending on the focus who what in which form to whom to which effect there exist various classifications. some of those systematical questions are elaborated in communication theory. communication as information transmission communication: transmitting a message with the expectation of some kind of response. this can be interpersonal or intrapersonal. communication can be seen as processes of information transmission governed by three levels of semiotic rules: syntactic formal properties of signs and symbols pragmatic concerned with the relations between and their users and semantic study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent. therefore communication is social interaction where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of semiotic rules. this commonly held rule in some sense ignores autocommunication including intrapersonal communication via or self-talk. image:communication major dimensions code in a simple model information or content e.g. a message in natural language is sent in some form as spoken language from an encoder to a decoder. in a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked a particular instance of communication is called a speech act. in the presence of noise on the transmission channel air in this case reception and decoding of content may be faulty and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. dialogue is a form of communication in which both the parties are involved in sending and receiving information. theories of coregulation describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process rather than a discrete exchange of information. nonverbal communication is the act of imparting or interchanging thoughts posture opinions or information without the use of words using gestures sign language facial expressions and body language instead. information exchange between living organisms communication in many of its facets is not limited to humans or even to primates. every information exchange between living organisms  i.e. transmission of signals involving a living sender and receiver information  can be considered a form of communication. thus there is the broad field of animal communication which encompasses most of the issues in ethology. on a more basic level there is cell signaling cellular communication communication and chemical communication between primitive organisms like bacteria and within the plant and kingdoms. all of these communication processes are sign-mediated interactions with a great variety of distinct coordinations. animal communication is any behaviour on the part of one animal that has an effect on the current or future behavior of another animal. of course human communication can be subsumed as a highly developed form of animal communication. the study of animal communication called zoosemiotics distinguishable from anthroposemiotics the study of human communication has played an important part in the development of ethology sociobiology and the study of animal cognition. this is quite evident as humans are able to communicate with animals especially dolphins and other animals used in circuses however these animals have

communications media impact more than the reach of messages. they impact content and customs for example thomas edison had to discover that hello was the least ambiguous greeting by voice over a distance previous greetings such as hail tended to be garbled in the transmission. similarly the terseness of e-mail and chat rooms produced the need for the emoticon. modern communication media now allow for intense long-distance exchanges between larger numbers of people many-to-many communication via e-mail internet forums. on the other hand many traditional broadcast media and mass media favor one-to-many communication television radio newspaper magazines. for effective communication in specialized contexts certain strategies can be taken that will help people achieve their goals and can be seen as techniques for attaining the purpose of communication. below is a list with explanations of communication strategies used in marketing and selling: adaptive innovation: building or improving products services and processes while working with a customer versus building products or services outside a customer engagement. relates to service companies working with large enterprises. entrepreneurial management: describes a business where the employees are expected to work and relate to each other as self driven business partners versus expecting to be mentored by a command and control management structure. this assumes the phrase be the leader you seek. one voice:a skill used to manage customer team meetings where one person is designated the leader and other team members direct all their comments and questions through the designated onevoice speaker rather than to the customers. showtime: a term related to business people being on stage at all times during a meeting or customer visit. strategic speed: a term related to working fast and smart constantly looking for opportunities to improve and innovate. discipline of dialogue: a term related to controlling your words and conversations during a business meeting or presentation. soler egan  is a technique used by care workers. it helps clients or patients to feel safe and to trust the care-giver and assists in effective communication. soler means: :s  sit squarely in relation to the patient :o  open position :l  lean slightly towards the patient :e  eye contact metacommunication is the process of communicating about communication for example to discuss a past conversation and to determine the meanings behind certain words phrases etc.. it can be used as a tool for sense making or for better understanding events places people relationships etc.. the ability to communicate on the meta-level requires introspection and more specifically what is called metacommunicative competence. it is not a distinct form of communication as seen from the five aspects mentioned in the introduction. the events occurring within a given communicative episode help the participants make relational sense out of the experience. e.g. this is an order please or i am joking. different levels at which people reflect on their communication:  labels what kind of message he sends and how serious he is.  says why sent the message.  says why he sent the message by referring to the other's wishes.  says why he sent the message by referring to a request of the other.  says why he sent the message referring to the kind of response he was trying to elicit.  says what he was trying to get the other to do. baumeister r. f. amp leary m. r. . the need to belong: desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental

21	effective communication by irshad mahmood president siraat-al-mustaqeem dawah centre never stop: listening learning and thinking. repeating and reminding is a key to success of effective communication dont lose your temper instead go for table talk with a positive attitude. scholars had done their best but they are not allah and may do mistakes. effective communication is important for living systems for power control and survival. without effective communication societies or systems cannot organize themselves or perform desired functions. living systems or societies are information processing units and information can only be communicated effectively if the communication channels are free from any disturbance or noise. as an example: for transactions in banks they need error free transactions not a single mistake. allah also points towards effective communication we need to open our eyes little deeper from inside of our heart to understand it: when the quraan is read listen to it with attention and hold your peace: that you may receive mercy otherwise may be not. alquraan. to get real mercy of allah you must have to listen carefully in a noise free environment when the quraan is read in a group otherwise you may not get the real mercy from allah. some people might take time to understand an issue while other may take very less time. the problem in taking time to understand an issue could be the intellectuality levels or wrong pre-assumptions of the individual person. intellectuality level takes time since there is no other solution than just to wait till the person acquires more knowledge. remember a person takes around  years of age time to become a professional doctor. every thing takes times. pre-assumptions take times since it might have wrong pre-assumptions which is haraam. i would like to give an example here to make it more understandable: suppose you have alcohol which is haraam and clean water which is halaal and you need to fill a glass with clean water. the problem could be that the glass might have filled up with alcohol so in order to fill the glass with clean water you need to take out alcohol completely and also rinse it properly. even a single drop of alcohol will make the glass of water haraam. while it is very easy to fill an empty glass with clean water and takes very less time. so in order to understand some of the logic you might need to clean our heart with justice and truthfulness with allah. be careful when discussing the ayaat of the quraan and be honest to allah otherwise it might put you into the category of liars to quraan which is an extremely dangerous shirk. instead of loosing your temper go for table talk with a positive attitude. always make duaa that if i am wrong may allah correct me. if you are wrong may allah correct you. if we both are wrong may allah correct both of us. ameen. by denying the ayaat of quraan may cause you to fall in the category of looking for other religion so be careful: o ye who believe! whoso of you becomes a renegade from his religion know that in his stead allah will bring a people whom he loves and who love him humble toward believers stern toward disbelievers striving in the way of allah and fearing not the blame of any blamer. such is the grace of allah which he gives unto whom he will. allah is all embracing all knowing. alquraan. trying to change the ayaat of quraan by denying it may cause you into the category of liar to quraan. even rasool allah saw did not had authority to change any of the ayaat of quraan so be careful: but when our clear signs are rehearsed unto them those who rest not their hope on their meeting with us say: bring us reading other than this or change this say: it is not for me of my own accord to change it: i follow naught but what is revealed unto me as is: if i were to disobey my lord i should myself fear the penalty of a great day to come. say: if allah had to willed i should not have rehearsed it to you nor would he have made it known to you. a whole lifetime before this have i tarried amongst you: will ye not then understand? alquraan.   and recite and teach what has been revealed to thee of the book of thy lord: none can change his words and none wilt thou find as a refuge other than him. alquraan. for speakers writers and teachers or instructors: you are great doing very great job but we are unable to understand you. may be your level of communication is very high so it is not effective and you are fail to communicate the great message of deen to us. if you really want to transfer your knowledge below are my advise. for an effective communication level language and timing should be accurate. perhaps you need to come a little lower level the level on which we listeners or readers are. may be you are using high-level language so you need to speak in little lower level language. may be the timings are not appropriate and you need to wait little while minutes hours days weeks months. may be you needed to repeat it several times. if you are writing try to use bold color etc. to highlight your main points. try to write short and effective few pages and one topic in your article. keep in mind  people dont have time to read your very long article. if you are speakers and giving lectures try to be specific to the point with few examples. use variable tone and keep asking small question like did you understand or are you following me. if your lecture may go more than an hour give ten minutes break to the listener to digest it. summarize it at the end. acknowledgement is an essential part of an effective communication. acknowledgement cannot be completed without a session on questions and answers. you need to give appropriate time for questions amp answers. never ever mention any unislaamic addresses web sights etc in public. report to law and order enforcement agencies police if possible. for listeners readers and students: may be it is you who is not co-operating and not trying to understand and wasting the costly time of great scholars. try to understand how hard they are trying to explain trying to explain at lowest level in your lower level language and giving you enough time to think about it. to be part of an effective communication you need to be co-operative. you need to open your eyes from inside your heart so that you can read effectively. you also need to open your ear from inside your heart so that you can hear effectively. you may need to re-read or listen again and again. take your time to understand deen but dont be too late that you miss the train of your life. no body knows when he will die. acknowledgement is an essential part of an effective communication. acknowledgement cannot be completed without a session on questions and answers. you need to ask questions in a polite manner to get more clarification. always try to use words like please thank you brothers and sisters in your communication. great thanks to our scholars ulemaa who have worked extremely hard to keep islaam alive and to keep us muslims by providing beautiful knowledge of islaam. but scholars are not allah and they might do mistakes. you must always check in the quraan and the authentic sunnah and don't blindly trust on scholars writers and speakers etc. they are human being and may have made mistakes. otherwise you may fall into the category of making the scholars your god. be careful. check the topic in the quraan what allah is saying about check the true meaning of it. if you find any error in scholars writers speakers etc. you must acknowledge them by telling the scholars writers speakers etc. otherwise the misleading may go on and on and also you might be put into the category of supporters to them who have done wrong translation and allah may punish you as well. so dont sit quietly and rise up to correct any misconception it is also a great jihaad and you will get a great reward for it inshaa allah. you must also know how to understand the quraan. you must learn first and then teach others: prophet muhammad saw said the best of best among you are those who learns and teaches quraan. bukharivolbookhadith allah does not love the public utterance of hurtful speech language unless it be by one to whom injustice has been done and allah is hearing knowing. alquraan. anxiety stress or tension hurts you specially from the loved ones: anxiety is also a weapon to heart or kill some one even without knowing it since it may cause dangerous diseases like blood pressure sugar heart attack etc. although in this world it may be hard to prove it but on the day of judgment allah will sure ask about this as well. so change your attitude before it gets too late. anxiety occurs when both the parties disagree on some matters. it hurts you badly if you get it from your loved ones for others you normally don't care. generally we do the great mistake that i am right. you must avoid the great mistake that i am right and all others are wrong even though you are a scholar or an elder after all you are still a human being. usually the one who is wrong yells more. stop behaving like its my way or no way. allah has very clearly mentioned in the quraan to avoid anxiety. there is no compulsion in religion .. alquraan: also it is not only true for the disbelievers but also for the different sects that your believe is with you and my believe is with me. to you is your religion and to me is my religion. alquraan: invite all to the way of thy lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: for thy lord knoweth best who have strayed from his path and who receive guidance. alquraan. also remember that both musaa pbuh and khizr pbuh were prophets and obeyed allah but disagreed on some of their mission. so we might differ in our missions to help the world but our goal to obey allah is same. you might be obeying allah according to what you understand and i am also obeying allah according to what you understand. it is time to unite not divide. after all we are human being and may be wrong on some point so we need to make a very special duaa: o allah! guide us and help us. if i am wrong o allah! correct me. if others are wrong o allah correct them. if we all are wrong o allah correct all of us. ameen. some damaging things in children who are yelled: don't yell on your child: look different or are different. are stressed depressed all the time which may cause blood pressure diabetes sugar heart attack stroke etc. struggle with daily life. are not good at activities. are unable to hold their own. stop yelling on your child and be a role model for your child. same is also true for adult as well. thy lord hath decreed that ye worship none but him and that ye be kind to parents. whether one or both of them attain old age in thy life say not to them a word of contempt nor repel them but address them in terms of honor. alquraan. a muslim is the one who avoids harming muslims with his her tongue and hands .. sahih bukhari  vol book belief hadeeth-. so encourage and do not discourage and apply the logics of psychology. on the day when their tongues their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to their actions. alquraan: duaa for scholars and students: rabbi zidnee aailmaa. o my lord! increase me in knowledge. ref: alquraan. ameen. rabbishrah lee sadree wayassir lee amree wahlul aauqdatan min lisanee yafqahoo qawlee. o my lord! expand my breast and ease my task for me and loose the knot from my tongue so they may understand what i say. ref: alquraan.   ameen. rabbana hab lana min azwajina wathurriyyatina qurrata aaayunin wajjaaalna lilmuttaqeena imamaan. o our lord! grant us in our wives and our offspring the joy of our eyes and give us the grace to lead the righteous. ref: alquraan.. ameen. to whom allah has given the ability to dawah must start doing positive dawah now. to whom allah has given the ability to speak must start speaking now but no violence. to whom allah has given the ability to write must start writing now but no violence. to whom allah has given the ability to go on the media must start going on to the media now but no-violence. to whom allah has given the ability to do other peaceful and non-violent things must start doing peaceful and non-violent things now. violence is hurting islaam very badly. never stop: listening learning and thinking. may allah help us to do effective communication to spread deen. ameen. mission to save the whole world from disasters quraan is full of wisdom alquraan. quraan is a light and to see a light you dont need any other light. quraan is free from any error or contradictions. when the quraan is recited then listen to it and remain silent that mercy may be shown to you. alquraan. repeating and reminding is a key to the success of effective communication. you are fully allowed to copy forward

patience wasnt exactly one of her virtues riddhima turned around in shock as she came face to face with source of the voice. dressed up in a long silken rob with a dropping white beard and a checked scarf tied to his head with a band holding it he pulled her into a hug. a surprised riddhima crashed into him as he pulled her. ridz its me atul. hug me back as if you know me. he urgently whispered in her ears. hugging him ridz smiled falsely. ah my baby is such big girl now i still remember how you would call me dubai uncle. ahh my girl you have grown into such a pretty lady. atul spoken in broken english with a strong arabic accent .riddhima put up her smile as they walked into the coffee shop. sitting opposite him she saw him pull out a bag and thrust it in her hand. my old lady has given a gift to her angel like daughter. she misses you beta. always remember beta that we might not be there physically with you but we are watching from far. our blessings are always there our child. riddhima nodded a grin forming on her lips. this was an old code of talking. my old lady meant the agent working along side which meant rahul in this case and blessings meant that they were backing her up and would be trailing her. and the bag in her hand would consist of the goodies .the spy goodies. but the question was how was she carrying them through the airport security? she was sure that frank must have arranged something. still she asked uncle i hope aunty has not packed any flour or raw fruits because you see they have become pretty strict at the airport nowadays. with the security i mean she added smiling. ohh dont worry dear. no such issues will arise. the officers wont stop you for a bunch of pickles and some dry fruits and stuff ok riddhima thought grinning. that meant her coast was clear and she wont have to do any explaining to the officers at the airport security. ok dear its time for your flight. ill get going. nice meeting you my child. wish you all the luck for your new job. may you have all the success in your life with a final handshake he parted ways leaving her behind. riddhima got up with a small smile playing around her lips. it was time for action. she felt the same rush of blood through her veins out of excitement. she was now on her own. and she was definitely looking forward to this case and her new boss she thought her eyes dancing. hmm yesall checked riddhima thought as she peered into the bag that atul had left her. standing in the toilet she tried her best to maintain her balance as she checked the contents. obviously i cant search through the bag in open she thought. she had reached the airport a bit earlier than she was supposed to meet the her boss and she took the opportunity to check the contents of her bag so that she knew what all she had on her. stealing the chance she had rushed to the washroom and locked the door of the toilet and opened her bag. remaining of her luggage was in the hired mercedes. wow she muttered with delight. frank has given me a great stock she spoke as she skimmed through the contents. tracking devices gsm g camera wireless spy camera voice recorders phone tracking device bug detectors gsm bugs and a couple of other priceless stuff according to her. she removed her pro  from her purse and tucked it in the bag as she zipped it close. the bag was to remain with her anyways and she wasnt sure if her new boss would be happy if he discovered her carrying a silencer in her purse which was supposed to contain gloss lip balms and perfumes. she smiled as she added last minute touches to herself looking in the mirror after her a little session in the toilet. applying a liner to highlight her eyes with a faint blush on her cheeks she grinned at her reflection. finally touching her lips with a gloss she dusted her one piece halter neck dress which ran down to reach her knees she was wearing to erase any crease. starring at the reflection she muttered as she combed her hair in its placethe strands falling on her bare shoulders as she left them open. time to meet armaan mallik yes dad.i got the filesyes i will give your regards to her i will take care. yes.byeeeee dad. and love you dad he cut the call sighing. dad he muttered as he got down from the bentley and went to the deck to remove the bags along with the driver. sir ill mange. you dont need too.i mean the driver turned to him in surprise as he helped get the bags down. oh come on sam ill help. its my luggage afterall he winked. sam smiled. he had been his driver cum chauffer ever since the boy had been a child. he had seen him grow up in front of him and he was such a kind soul unlike the usual rich brats of his age. ok sam ill take your leave he hugged him. yes yes ill take care headed seeing sam open his mouth. pushing his trolley full of luggage he waved turning behind. byee and give my love to dad again. baba i will.dont worry sam grinned. ok i better get going. have to meet my new assistant. dont want to annoy her by being late on the very first day he grinned as he walked in through the gates. ok dude she hasnt arrived as yet or maybe she is on her way or maybe in the washroom. you better be ready to greet her well he thought as he sat down in the waiting area. their flight to cape town was due in an hour and he was supposed to meet his new assistant before they boarded. now why am so excited? he thought grinning. well because of the very fact that he finally had the chance to work and be with some one his age .and that too without his dads interference he thought. all his life from the very childhood days he had been this guarded boy .a child worth millions of dollars. he was which was a fact. being the only heir to mallik empires he knew his fathers concern. but did that mean he have shadows around him all the time??? he was home schooled much to his annoyance and every move was watched. he hated having those big burly guards with guns and stern faces around him right from the childhood days. where ever he went he had them watching him. be it anything. even when he hit the bed he had two prowling outside his room. and he accepted it mutely because his mom had made him accept it. over the years she had been his only comfort and solace. he hated being treated like a royalty and would envy the guys his age who could just move about anywhere they wanted and anyhow. but his mom had been his comfort. she had been his friend philosopher and guide. but she left him..and went awayfar awaytoo far for him to ever reach out to her ever again. he closed his eyes as the painful memory resurfaced .then things changed. he revolted. he wanted to live his life his way he had told his dad. if he did not learn the ropes of life himself how did his dad expect him to grow up? he confronted his dad and told him he would run away if he ever found any guard near him he had fought and gotten himself enrolled in the university for graduation rather then go for private tutoring again as per his dads wishes. his dad had agreed in the end but on the condition he still had guards watch him from far .he had no choice but agree. still it did make him stand out from the rest. he came to be known as the protected prince. wherever he went he had people watching him. later he accepted the fact. he was a standout among the crowd. and he can never over shadow the fact. he was malliks only heir and his dad would leave no stone unturned for his safety. he completed his masters anyways and was soon ready to assist his father. he recalled how taken aback he was when he had been introduced to his own secretary in office. he was a  year old man with all greys in his hair and treated him like a baby. and soon he saw that even with him now controlling the empire his father would always take the final call. how he missed going around with friends for late nights or simply just hanging around. but soon came this cape town opportunity. it was a long project and he jumped to the opportunity as soon as he saw it. but he made a condition. no guards or guns accompanying him. and miraculously his dad had agreed later specifying his conditions. his dad had given him the condition that he would have no guards watching him if and only if he would have his new assistant accompany him. he had his doubts on this as he recollected his grandfather secretary earlier. but when his dad mentioned it was a young girl.. she is my friends daughter joining our company .just your age my boy. you can handle this project if you agree to take her along with you to cape town as your assistant how could he refuse? he was confused. guarded by guns all life and now set loose with a girl??? but!!!!!!!! finally a young female to be by his side??? it wasnt that he never had women in his life. he did have girl friends in the past. but either it was because he was the mallik boy or he had the fame  power moneyeverything. but half of girls had chickened out seeing those guns going around with him. so he had jumped hearing he was getting an assistant of his age.a female assistant to be more precise he smiled as at the thought. just hope shes interesting he muttered. umm mr mallik?? he turned around and got up. armaan mallik? she asked again. nice to meet you mr mallik seeing him nod. i am riddhima riddhima gupta. your new assistant she smiled. hi umm riddhima..yeah i am armaan mallik. sorry i didnt know how to recognize you.had no picture or anything he mumbled as he looked at her. no its fine i have seen your pictures so its really fine. she smiled back. umm sorry to be asking you..but i huh.need to see your proof. i mean i am sorry but.. armaan looked at her sheepishly. it was such a pathetic start to start a conversation with a young lady by asking her to prove herself he thought .but he no choice. oh sure he saw her smile as she fished her purse. she was such a dainty little thing he thought as he saw her searching her purse. beautiful dainty little thing he corrected himself. her figure was perfect the one piece complimenting it beautifully. the soft strands of her hair were falling loose on her shoulders. she tucked her hair covering her face with one hand as her other hand dug into her purse hung from her shoulder. riddhima a beautiful name he thought. her features complimented her figure he thought as he glanced at her. deep green eyes highlighted with just a tinge of black liner .the slight blush on her smooth flawless skin .she surely knows how to carry herself he wondered. she was a beautiful lady in his eyes and he was definitely looking forward to hear her talk. there. she looked at him gazing at her as she held out her passport. she had expected this. he took it from her and glanced. riddhima shanshank gupta he read as he turned her passport. his father did warn him about fake passports but she looked so genuine and sweet. hmm mr mallik dont worry it isnt fake she smiled reading his thoughts. ughhh no noi didnt mean too.armaan muttered hastily being caught unaware. great he thought. our very first meet and i give her and impression of being a stuck up dude. god armaan!!! no i completely understand mr mallik. its really fine. now if you have finished seeing thisshall we?? our flight call has just been announced she smiled sweetly. oh sure armaan smiled deeply. riddhima gupta was a different creature. she had merely smiled as he checked her proof and seemed to comfortable around him without any flatters!! call me armaan he added as he saw her turning her trolley. and hey riddhima ill push it. you dont need to take the trouble he moved forward and placed his hand on the handle besides hers stopping her trolley. ok armaan you already have yours your luggage. i am perfectly alright carrying mine. thankyou she replied amused at his mannerisms. nowait. i hardly have much. we will transfer your stuff to mine. then i take it. i wont have a beautiful lady like yourself doing it with me beside her he spoke charmingly. no its really finei mean come on. he pushed her aside and quickly transferred the luggage and pushed the trolley ahead toward the customs gate. as she followed him riddhima smiled. he was a charmer for sure. unlike the men she had been company too past so many years. they were no doubt handsome but were hard fbi agents. no time for such soft talks with them. their talks would start and end on guns. but armaan mallik was a specimen. he was handsome.deep grey twinkling eyes .and a perfectly toned body with a great sense of fashion and style as she observed him in the black half sleeve shirt with matching jeans complimenting his fair skin awesomely. the armani scent he wore was pleasing and he had perfect manners of a gentle man. she saw him smile back at her as they stood at the customs gate. this trip will be fun and interesting with armaan mallik by my side she mused. okieee the much awaited meet between ar was there. hopefully u guys will forgive me for my delayed update. i was sitting under the belief that my ff wasnt liked much .. but oh well i am out of such illusions hence sorry for the delays. pls do leave a word if u find it worth ur time. they make my day u see. ok enuf of my bashan. will be waiting for ur criticisms and views. edited by jia..   september  at :am  banner signatures viewable to members only with video avatar and signature banner options set  the following  members says thank you to jia.. for this useful post: joined:  december  direct link posted:  august  at :am ip logged  banner signatures viewable to members only with video avatar and signature banner options set  joined:  december  direct link posted:  august  at :am ip logged :  september  utc:  september  utc:  september  user :  september  utc  banner signatures viewable to members only with video avatar and signature banner options set  joined:  december  direct link posted:  august  at :am ip logged  banner signatures viewable to members only with video avatar and signature banner options set  joined:  december  direct link posted:  august  at :am ip logged :  september  utc:  september  utc  banner signatures viewable to members only with video avatar and signature banner options set  joined:  january  direct link posted:  august  at :am ip logged yayyyyyyyyy!!!!!! i m d first one to comment i was just going through d pages wen i stumbled upon ur name .had a gr smile on my face wen i saw dat u had started anoder ff ..its a great one yaar very catchy title its too guddddddddd plzzzzzzzzzzz do update dis one soon n ur first ff too . n pm me if u can .. edited by madhsar   august  at :am joined:  may  direct link posted:  august  at :am ip logged cool cant wait to see riddhima as the sexy babe with gun under her belt.continue soon. joined:  october  direct link posted:  august  at :am ip logged u posted hurray . omg this is all ur work!! nothing to do with me .just advising nothing more .. guys this is all jia work ..im just editin on this one  banner signatures viewable to members only with video avatar and signature banner options set  page  of   previous            next india forums colors bollywood channel sony entertainment tv star plus tv zee tv serials starone channel saharaone television x sab tv ndtv imagine popular tv shows with daily updates tamil tv shows foriegn channels india forums development group general discussion forums forums avatar  signatures shop celebrity fan clubs chat clubs debate mansion fan fictions fan fictions archived comments harry potter live radio show interviews members lounge memeu.com new members intro podcasts  reviews and comments rules  announcements suggestions comments topics replies last post ff:perfect imperfection lov..lastpart   august  at :pm best jodi on tv   august  at :am ff: dill mill gayye 17th may new note!!!   may  at :pm proof of shilpa leaving   may  at :am watchin dill mill gayye with parents!!   may  at :am change in armaans face??

21	 in philosophy two different theories are labelled egoism: psychological egoism is the view that one is always motivated to act in one's own best interests while ethical egoism is the view that one ought always to act in one's own best interests. see psychological egoism and ethical egoism.
 generally the term egoism has been used with perjorative connotations it has been applied to philosophers such as bernard de mandeville and to many other materialsts of his generation but none of them declared themselves as such. the first western philosopher apply the label of egoism to his or her own work was max stirner -although he did in effect re-invent the meaning of the term to suit his philosophy.
 in eastern philosophy the debate around equivalent terms has been somewhat broader not merely questioning the ethical validity of serving oneself but questioning what the self is and whether such an entity can be defined or presumed to exist. debates of this kind span hinduism buddhism and neo-taoism. see: atman anatman pudgalavada.

21	capturing the wind to perform work is nothing new. farmers have been using windmill for centuries to help irrigate fields and provide water for animals. the most well know examples are dutch windmills which have been used to help grind corn pump water and even saw lumber. in modern times energy is captured from the wind by the use of wind turbines. the most common type of wind turbine is three bladed though two and four bladed ones can be found. most turbines have blades that rotate perpendicular to the wind though there is a variety that rotates parallel to it. wind turbines must be placed in an area where there is a fairly constant source of wind. the most productive locations are on or near the shore of a large lake sea or ocean though they can be place anywhere that there is a breeze.

21	when you think about electricity you probably do not think about lightning. the electricity in lightning is example ststic electricity. what is static electricity? is't same as the electricity that runs appliances and makes live so convenient? in this chapter you will discover what the lightning that flashes overhead has in common what the electricity that runs a cd player. understanding electricity is on of the steps to understanding the world around you. 
21	background information: electricity came from a man named benjamin franklin . his kite experiment demonstrated that lightning is electricity. he was the first to use the terms positive and negative charge. in order to conduct electricity a solution must contain dissolved ions. these ions or electrolytes allow the electric current to move through the solution. some solutions do not conduct very well since the concentrations of ions are low. others conduct very well. soda has carbonation which is just carbon dioxide dissolved in water. when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water a weak acid system is created in which carbonic acid hco bicarbonate ion hco and carbonate ion co exist in solution. there are also other things dissolved in there which probably contribute too. the presence of these ion forms as well as others will allow an applied current to pass through the solution although it will probably be somewhat weak.

justice the technical effort to develop this guide was conducted under interagency agreement ij-r project no. -ctt. this guide was prepared by the office of law enforcement standards oles of the national institute of standards and technology nist under the direction of a. george lieberman program manager for communications systems and kathleen m. higgins director of oles. the work resulting in this guide was sponsored by the national institute of justice david g. boyd director office of science and technology. the office of law enforcement standards oles of the national institute of standards and technology furnishes technical support to the national institute of justice program to strengthen law enforcement and criminal justice in the united states. oles's function is to conduct research that will assist law enforcement and criminal justice agencies in the selection and procurement of quality equipment. oles is:  subjecting existing equipment to laboratory testing and evaluation and  conducting research leading to the development of several series of documents including national standards user guides and this document covers research conducted by oles under the sponsorship of the national institute of justice. additional reports as well as other documents are being issued under the oles program in the areas of protective clothing and equipment communications systems emergency equipment investigative aids security systems vehicles weapons and analytical techniques and standard reference materials used by the forensic technical comments and suggestions concerning this report are invited from all interested parties. they may be addressed to the director office of law enforcement standards national institute of standards and technology gaithersburg md . david g. boyd director office of science and technology national institute of justice the office of law enforcement standards oles was established by the national institute of justice nij to provide focus on two major objectives:  to find existing equipment which can be purchased today and  to develop new law-enforcement equipment which can be made available as soon as possible. part of oles's mission is to become thoroughly familiar with existing equipment to evaluate its performance by means of objective laboratory tests to develop and improve these methods of test to develop performance standards for selected equipment items and to prepare guidelines for the selection and use of this equipment. all of these activities are directed toward providing law enforcement agencies with assistance in making good equipment selections and acquisitions in accordance with their own requirements. as the oles program has matured there has been a gradual shift in the objectives of the oles projects. the initial emphasis on the development of standards has decreased and the emphasis on the development of guidelines has increased. for the significance of this shift in emphasis to be appreciated the precise definitions of the words standard and guideline as used in this context must be clearly understood. a standard for a particular item of equipment is understood to be a formal document in a conventional format that details the performance that the equipment is required to give and describes test methods by which its actual performance can be measured. these requirements are technical and are stated in terms directly related to the equipment's use. the basic purposes of a standard are  to be a reference in procurement documents created by purchasing officers who wish to specify equipment of the standard quality and  to identify objectively equipment of note that a standard is not intended to inform and guide the reader that is the function of a guideline. guidelines are written in non-technical language and are addressed to the potential user of the equipment. they include a general discussion of the equipment its important performance attributes the various models currently on the market objective test data where available and any other information that might help the reader make a rational selection among the various options or alternatives available to him or her. this battery guide is provided to inform the reader of the latest technology national institute of standards and technology . fundamentals of battery technology . what is a battery? . how

battery in concept can be any device that stores energy for later use. a rock pushed to the top of a hill can be considered a kind of battery since the energy used to push it up the hill chemical energy from muscles or combustion engines is converted and stored as potential kinetic energy at the top of the hill. later that energy is released as kinetic and thermal energy the rock rolls down the hill. common use of the word battery however is limited to an electrochemical device that converts chemical energy into electricity by use of a galvanic cell. a galvanic cell is a fairly simple device consisting of two electrodes an anode and a cathode and an electrolyte solution. batteries consist of one or more galvanic cells. .. how does a battery work? figure  shows a simple galvanic cell. electrodes two plates each made from a different kind of metal or metallic compound are placed in an electrolyte solution. external wires connect the electrodes to an electrical load a light bulb in this case. the metal in the anode the negative terminal oxidizes i.e. it rusts releasing negatively charged electrons and positively charged metal ions. the electrons travel wire and the electrical load to the cathode the positive terminal. the electrons combine with the material in the cathode. this combination process is called reduction and it releases a negatively charged metal-oxide ion. at the interface with the electrolyte this ion causes a water molecule to split into a hydrogen ion and a hydroxide ion. the positively charged hydrogen ion combines with the negatively charged metal-oxide ion and becomes inert. the negatively charged hydroxide ion flows through the electrolyte to the anode where it combines with the positively charged metal ion forming a water molecule and a metal-oxide in effect metal ions anode will dissolve the electrolyte solution while hydrogen molecules the electrolyte are deposited onto the cathode. when the anode fully oxidized or cathode is fully reduced chemical reaction will stop the battery is considered to be recharging a battery is usually a matter externally applying a voltage across the plates to reverse the chemical process. some chemical reactions however are difficult or impossible to reverse. cells irreversible reactions are commonly primary cells while cells with reversible reactions are known as secondary cells. is dangerous to attempt to recharge primary cells. the amount of voltage and current that a galvanic cell produces is directly related to the types of materials used in the electrodes and electrolyte. the length of time the cell can produce that voltage and current is related to the amount of active material in the cell and the cell's design. every metal or metal compound has an electromotive force which is the propensity of the metal to gain or lose electrons in relation to another material. compounds with a positive electromotive force will make good anodes and those with a negative force will make good cathodes. the cathode the greater the amount of energy that can be produced by the cell. table  shows the electromotive force of some common battery table . the

with different combinations of material and have generally tried to balance the potential energy output of a battery with the costs of manufacturing the battery. other factors battery weight shelf life and environmental impact also enter into a battery's design. .. galvanic cells vs. batteries from earlier discussion we know that a battery is one or more galvanic a battery composed of two . v galvanic cells connected in series for example will produce  v. a typical  v battery is simply six . v cells connected in series. such a series battery however will produce a current that is the equivalent to just one of the galvanic cells. a battery composed of two . v galvanic cells connected in parallel on the other hand will still produce a voltage of . v but the current provided can be double the current that just one cell would create. such a battery can provide current twice as long as a single cell. many galvanic cells can be thus connected to create a battery with almost a primary battery is a battery that is designed to be cycled fully discharged only once and then discarded. although primary batteries are often made from the same base materials as secondary rechargeable batteries the design and manufacturing processes are not the same. battery manufacturers recommend that primary batteries not be recharged. although attempts at recharging a primary battery will occasionally succeed usually with a diminished capacity it is more likely that the battery will simply fail to hold any charge will leak electrolyte onto the battery charger or will overheat and cause a fire. it is unwise and dangerous to recharge a primary battery. a secondary battery is commonly known as a rechargeable battery. it is usually designed to have a lifetime of between  and  recharge cycles depending on the composite materials. secondary batteries are generally more cost effective over time than primary batteries since the battery can be recharged and reused. a single discharge cycle of a primary battery however will provide more current for a longer period of time than a single discharge cycle of an equivalent the american national standards institute ansi standard ansi c.m lists several battery features that must be listed on a battery's label. they are:  manufacturer  the name of the battery manufacturer.  ansi number  the number of the battery.  date  the month and year that the battery was manufactured or the month and year that the battery expires i.e. is no longer guaranteed by  polarity  the positive and negative terminals. the terminals must be  warnings  other warnings and cautions related to battery usage and . available battery types ... acid vs. alkaline batteries are often classified by the type of electrolyte used in their construction. there are three common classifications: acid mildly acid acid-based batteries often use sulphuric acid as the major component of the electrolyte. automobile batteries are acid-based. the electrolyte used in mildly acidic batteries is far less corrosive than typical acid-based batteries and usually includes a variety of salts that produce the desired acidity level. inexpensive household batteries are mildly acidic batteries. alkaline batteries typically use sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide as the main component of the electrolyte. alkaline batteries are often used in applications where long-lasting high-energy output is needed such as cellular phones portable cd players radios pagers and flash cameras. ... wet vs. dry wet cells refer to galvanic cells where the electrolyte is liquid in form and is allowed to flow freely within the cell casing. wet batteries are often sensitive to the orientation of the battery. for example if a wet cell is oriented such that a gas pocket accumulates around one of the electrodes the cell will not produce current. most automobile batteries are wet cells. dry cells are cells that use a solid or powdery electrolyte. these kind of electrolytes use the ambient moisture in the air to complete the chemical process. cells with liquid electrolyte can be classified as dry if the electrolyte is immobilized by some mechanism such as by gelling it or by holding it in place with an absorbent substance such as paper. in common usage dry cell batteries will usually refer to zinc-carbon cells sec. .. or zinc alkaline-manganese dioxide cells sec. .. where the electrolyte is often gelled or held in place by absorbent paper. some cells are difficult to categorize. for example one type of cell is designed to be stored for long periods without its electrolyte present. just before power is needed from the cell liquid electrolyte is added. batteries can further be classified by their intended use. the following sections discuss four generic categories of batteries vehicular batteries and other batteries sec. .. each section will focus on the general note that some battery types acidic or alkaline wet or dry can fall into several different categories. for this guideline battery types are placed into the category in which they are most likely to be found in commercial this section discusses battery types and configurations that are typically used in motor vehicles. this category can include batteries that drive motors directly or those that provide starting energy for combustion engines. this category will also include large stationary batteries used as power sources for emergency building lighting remote-site power and computer back up. vehicular batteries are usually available off-the-shelf in standard designs or can be custom built for specific applications. lead-acid batteries developed in the late 1800s, were the first commercially practical batteries. batteries of this type remain popular because they are relatively inexpensive to produce and sell. the most widely known uses of lead-acid batteries are as automobile batteries. rechargeable lead-acid batteries have become the most widely used type of battery in the world--more than  times the use rate of its nearest rivals. in fact battery manufacturing is the single largest use for lead in the equation  shows the chemical reaction in a lead-acid cell. lead-acid batteries remain popular because they can produce high or low over a wide range of temperatures they have good shelf life and life cycles and they are relatively inexpensive manufacture. lead-acid batteries are usually rechargeable. lead-acid batteries come in all manner of shapes and sizes from household batteries to large batteries for submarines. the most noticeable shortcomings of lead-acid batteries are their relatively heavy weight and their falling voltage profile during discharge sec. .. ... sealed vs. flooded in flooded batteries the oxygen created at the positive electrode is hydrogen created at the negative electrode is also vented into the atmosphere. the overall result is a net loss of water ho from the cell. this lost water needs to be periodically replaced. flooded batteries must be vented to prevent excess pressure from the build up of these gases. also the room or enclosure housing the battery must be vented since a concentrated hydrogen and oxygen atmosphere is explosive. in sealed batteries however the generated oxygen combines chemically with the lead and then the hydrogen at the negative electrode and then again with reactive agents in the electrolyte to recreate water. the net result is no significant loss of water from the cell. deep-cycle batteries are built in configurations similar to those of regular batteries except that they are specifically designed for prolonged use rather than for short bursts of use followed by a short recycling period. the term deep-cycle is most often applied to lead-acid batteries. deep- cycle batteries require longer charging times with lower current levels than is appropriate for regular batteries. as an example a typical automobile battery is usually used to provide a short intense burst of electricity to the automobile's starter. the battery is then quickly recharged by the automobile's electrical system as the engine runs. the typical automobile battery is not a deep-cycle battery. a battery that provides power to a recreational vehicle rv on the other hand would be expected to power lights small appliances and other electronics over an extended period of time even while the rv's engine is not running. deep-cycle batteries are more appropriate for this type of ... battery categories for vehicular batteries vehicular lead-acid batteries are further grouped by typical usage into three different  starting-lighting-ignition sli  typically these batteries are used for short quick-burst high-current applications. an example is an automotive battery which is expected to provide high current occasionally to the  traction  traction batteries must provide moderate power through many deep discharge cycles. one typical use of traction batteries is to provide power for small electric vehicles such as golf carts. this type of battery use is also called cycle service.  stationary  stationary batteries must have a long shelf life and deliver moderate to high currents when called upon. these batteries are most often used for emergencies. typical uses for stationary batteries are in uninterruptible power supplies ups and for emergency lighting in stairwells and hallways. this type of battery use is also called standby or household batteries are those batteries that are primarily used to power small portable devices such as flashlights radios laptop computers toys and cellular phones. the following subsections describe the technologies for many of the formerly used and presently used types of household typically household batteries are small . v cells that can be readily purchased off the shelf. these batteries come in standard shapes and sizes as shown in table .

because of their relatively low cost. equation  shows the chemical reaction in a leclanch cell. they were the first widely available household batteries. zinc-carbon cells are composed of a manganese dioxide and carbon cathode a zinc anode and zinc chloride or ammonium chloride as the electrolyte. generally zinc-carbon cells are not rechargeable and they have a sloping discharge curve i.e. the voltage level decreases relative to the amount of discharge. zinc-carbon cells will produce . v and they are mostly used for non-critical uses such as small household devices like flashlights and one notable drawback to these kind of batteries is that the outer protective casing of the battery is made of zinc. the casing serves as the anode for the cell and in some cases if the anode does not oxidize evenly the casing can develop holes that allow leakage of the mildly acidic electrolyte which can damage the device being powered. ... zinc-manganese dioxide alkaline cells alkaline batteries when an alkaline electrolyte--instead of the mildly acidic electrolyte--is used in a regular zinc carbon battery it is called an alkaline battery. an alkaline battery can have a useful life of five to six times that of a zinc-carbon battery. one manufacturer estimates that  of the household batteries sold in the world today are zinc-manganese dioxide ... rechargeable alkaline batteries like zinc-carbon batteries alkaline batteries are not generally rechargeable. one major battery manufacturer however has designed a reusable alkaline battery that they market as being rechargeable  this manufacturer states that its batteries do not suffer from memory effects as the ni-cd batteries do and that their batteries have a shelf life that is much longer than ni-cd batteries--almost as long as the shelf life of also the manufacturer states that their rechargeable alkaline batteries contain no toxic metals such as mercury or cadmium to contribute to the poisoning of the environment. rechargeable alkaline batteries are most appropriate for low and moderate-power portable equipment such as hand-held toys and radio nickel-cadmium cells are the most commonly used rechargeable household batteries. they are useful for powering small appliances such as garden tools and cellular phones. the basic galvanic cell in a ni-cd battery contains a cadmium anode a nickel hydroxide cathode and an alkaline electrolyte. equation  shows the chemical reaction in a ni-cd cell. batteries made from ni-cd cells offer high currents at relatively constant voltage and they are tolerant of physical abuse. nickel-cadmium batteries are also tolerant of inefficient usage cycling. if a ni-cd battery has incurred memory loss sec. . a few cycles of discharge and recharge can often restore the battery to nearly full memory. unfortunately nickel-cadmium technology is relatively expensive. cadmium is an expensive metal and is toxic. recent regulations limiting the disposal of waste cadmium from cell manufacturing or from disposal of used batteries has contributed to the higher costs of making and using these increased costs do have one unexpected advantage. it is more cost effective to recycle and reuse many of the components of a ni-cd battery than it is to recycle components of other types of batteries. several of the major battery manufacturers are leaders in such recycling efforts. ... nickel-metal hydride ni-mh battery designers have investigated several other types of metals that could be used instead of cadmium to create high-energy secondary batteries that are compact and inexpensive. the nickel metal-hydride cell is a widely used alternative. the anode of a ni-mh cell is made of a hydrogen storage metal alloy the cathode is made of nickel oxide and the electrolyte is a potassium according to one manufacturer ni-mh cells can last  longer than the same size ni-cd cells and will have a life-span of up to  cycles. this makes them useful for high-energy devices such as laptop computers cellular phones and camcorders. ni-mh batteries have a high self-discharge rate and are relatively nickel-iron cells also known as the edison battery are much less expensive to build and to dispose of than nickel-cadmium cells. nickel-iron cells were developed even before the nickel cadmium cells. the cells are rugged and reliable but do not recharge very efficiently. they are widely used in industrial settings and in eastern europe where iron and nickel are readily available and inexpensive. another alternative to using cadmium electrodes is using zinc electrodes. although the nickel zinc cell yields promising energy output the cell has some unfortunate performance limitations that prevent the cell from having a useful lifetime of more than  or so charging cycles. when nickel-zinc cells are recharged the zinc does not redeposit in the same holes on the anode that were created during discharge. instead the zinc redeposits in a somewhat random fashion causing the electrode to become misshapen. over time this leads to the physical weakening and eventual failure of the electrode. lithium is a promising reactant in battery technology due to its high electropositivity. the specific energy of some lithium-based cells can be five times greater than an equivalent-sized lead-acid cell and three times greater than alkaline batteries. lithium cells will often have a starting voltage of . v. these characteristics translate into batteries that are lighter in weight have lower per-use costs and have higher and more stable voltage profiles. equation  shows the chemical reaction in one kind unfortunately the same feature that makes lithium attractive for use in batteries--its high electrochemical potential--also can cause serious difficulties in the manufacture and use of such batteries. many of the inorganic components of the battery and its casing are destroyed by the lithium ions and on contact with water lithium will react to create hydrogen which can ignite or can create excess pressure in the cell. many fire extinguishers are water based and will cause disastrous results if used on lithium products. special d-class fire extinguishers must be used when lithium is known to be within the boundaries of a fire. lithium also has a relatively low melting temperature for a metal  degrees c  degrees f. if the lithium melts it may come into direct contact with the cathode causing violent chemical reactions. transportation dot has special guidelines for the transport and handling of lithium batteries. contact them to ask for dot regulations  cfr. some manufacturers are having success with lithium-iron sulfide lithium-manganese dioxide lithium-carbon monoflouride lithium-cobalt oxide and lithium-thionyl cells. in recognition of the potential hazards of lithium components manufacturers of lithium-based batteries have taken significant steps to add safety features to the batteries to ensure their safe use. lithium primary batteries in small sizes for safety reasons are currently being marketed for use in flash cameras and computer memory. lithium batteries can last three times longer than alkaline batteries of the same size. but since the cost of lithium batteries can be three times that of alkaline batteries the cost benefits of using lithium batteries are marginal. button-size lithium batteries are becoming popular for use in computer memory back-up in calculators and in watches. in applications such as these where changing the battery is difficult the longer lifetime of the lithium battery makes it a desirable choice. one company now produces secondary lithium-ion batteries with a voltage of . v four times the energy density of ni-cd batteries one-fifth the weight of ni-cd batteries and can be recharged  times. in general secondary rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have a good high-power performance an excellent shelf life and a better life span than ni-cd batteries. unfortunately they have a very high initial cost and the total energy available per usage cycle is somewhat less than ni-cd .. specialty batteries button and miniature batteries button batteries are the nickname given to the category of batteries that are small and shaped like a coin or a button. they are typically used for small devices such as cameras calculators and electronic watches. miniature batteries are very small batteries that can be custom built for devices such as hearing aids and electronic bugs where even button batteries can be too large. industry standardization has resulted in five to ten standard types of miniature batteries that are used throughout the together button batteries and miniature batteries are referred to as most button and miniature batteries need a very high energy density to compensate for their small size. the high energy density is achieved by the use of highly electropositive--and expensive--metals such as silver or mercury. these metals are not cost effective enough to be used in larger several compositions of specialty batteries are described in the following a very practical way to obtain high energy density in a galvanic cell is to utilize the oxygen in air as a liquid cathode. a metal such as zinc or aluminum is used as the anode. the oxygen cathode is reduced in a portion of the cell that is physically isolated from the anode. by using a gaseous cathode more room is available for the anode and electrolyte so the cell size can be very small while providing good energy output. small metal-air cells are available for hearing aids watches and clandestine listening devices. metal-air cells have some technical drawbacks however. it is difficult to build and maintain a cell where the oxygen acting as the cathode is completely isolated from the anode. also since the electrolyte is in direct contact with air approximately one to three months after it is activated the electrolyte will become too dry to allow the chemical reaction to continue. to prevent premature drying of the cells a seal is installed on each cell at the time of manufacture. this seal must be removed by the customer prior to first use of the cell. alternately the manufacturer can provide the battery in an air-tight package. silver oxide cells use silver oxide as the cathode zinc as the anode and potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte. silver oxide cells have a moderately high energy density and a relatively flat voltage profile. as a result they can be readily used to create specialty batteries. silver oxide cells can provide higher currents for longer periods than most other specialty batteries such as those designed from metal-air technology. due to the high cost of silver silver oxide technology is currently limited to use specialty batteries. mercury oxide cells are constructed with a zinc anode a mercury oxide cathode and potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide as the electrolyte. mercury oxide cells have a high energy density and flat voltage profile resembling the energy density and voltage profile of silver oxide cells. these mercury oxide cells are also ideal for producing specialty batteries. the component mercury unfortunately is relatively expensive and its disposal creates environmental problems. this section describes battery technology that is not mature enough to be available off-the shelf has special limitations or is otherwise impractical for general use. nickel-hydrogen cells were developed for the u.s. space program. under certain pressures and temperatures hydrogen which is surprisingly classified as an alkali metal can be used as an active electrode opposite nickel. although these cells use an environmentally attractive technology the relatively narrow range of conditions under which they can be used combined with the unfortunate volatility of hydrogen limits the long-range prospects of these cells for terrestrial uses. a thermal battery is a high-temperature molten-salt primary battery. at ambient temperatures the electrolyte is a solid non-conducting inorganic salt. when power is required from the battery an internal pyrotechnic heat source is ignited to melt the solid electrolyte thus allowing to be generated electrochemically for periods from a few seconds to an hour. thermal batteries are completely inert until the electrolyte is melted and therefore have an excellent shelf life require no maintenance and can tolerate physical abuse such as vibrations or shocks between uses. thermal batteries can generate voltages of . v to . v depending on the battery's composition. due to their rugged construction and absence of maintenance requirements they are most often used for military applications such as missiles torpedoes and space missions and for emergency-power situations such as those in aircraft or submarines. the high operating temperatures and short active lives of thermal batteries limit their use to military and other large-institution applications. this kind of battery uses no chemical reaction at all. instead a special kind of carbon carbon aerogel with a large molecular surface area is used to create a capacitor that can hold a large amount of electrostatic energy. this energy can be released very quickly providing a specific energy of up to  watt-hours per kilogram or it can be regulated to provide smaller currents typical of many commercial devices such as flashlights radios and toys. because there are no chemical reactions the battery can be recharged hundreds of thousands of times without degradation. other potential advantages of this kind of cell are its low cost and wide temperature range. one disadvantage however is its high self-discharge rate. the voltage of some prototypes is approximately ... the potato battery one interesting science experiment involves sticking finger-length pieces of copper and zinc wire one at a time into a raw potato to create a battery. the wires will carry a very weak current which can be used to power a small electrical device such as a digital clock. one vendor sells a novelty digital watch that is powered by a potato battery. the wearer must put a fresh slice of potato in the watch every few ... the sea battery another interesting battery design uses a rigid framework containing the anode and cathode which is immersed into the ocean to use sea water as the electrolyte. this configuration seems promising as an emergency battery for marine use. scientists are continually working on new combinations of materials for use in batteries as well as new manufacturing methods to extract more energy from existing configurations. . performance economics and tradeoffs the energy density of a battery is a measure of how much energy the battery can supply relative to its weight or volume. a battery with an energy density twice that of another battery should theoretically have an active lifetime twice as long. the energy density of a battery is mainly dependent on the composition of its active components. a chemist can use mathematical equations to determine the theoretical maximum voltage and current of a proposed cell if the chemical composition of the anode cathode and electrolyte of the cell are all known. various physical attributes such as purity of the measured voltage current and capacity to be lower than their theoretical .. energy per mass figure  compares the gravimetric energy densities of various dry cell systems discharged at a constant rate for temperatures between  degrees energy density. basic zinc-carbon cells have the lowest gravimetric energy .. energy per volume figure  compares the volumetric energy densities of various dry cell systems discharged at a constant rate for temperatures between  degrees energy density. basic zinc-carbon cells have the lowest volumetric energy density. the curves for secondary battery cells are not shown in the tables. of the major types of secondary cells ni-cd batteries and wet-cell lead-acid batteries have approximately the same volumetric energy density. ni-mh batteries have approximately twice the volumetric energy density of ni-cd batteries. as a rechargeable battery is used recharged and used again it loses a small amount of its overall capacity. this loss is to be expected in all secondary batteries as the active components become irreversibly ni-cd batteries however suffer an additional problem called the memory effect. if a ni-cd battery is only partially discharged before recharging it and this happens several times in a row the amount of energy available for the next cycle will only be slightly greater than the amount of energy discharged in the cell's most-recent cycle. this characteristic makes it appear as if the battery is remembering how much energy is needed for a the physical process that causes the memory effect is the formation of potassium-hydroxide crystals inside the cells. this build up of crystals interferes with the chemical process of generating electrons during the next battery-use cycle. these crystals can form as a result of repeated partial discharge or as a result of overcharging the ni-cd battery. the build up of potassium-hydroxide crystals can be reduced by periodically reconditioning the battery. reconditioning of a ni-cd battery is accomplished by carefully controlled power cycling i.e. deeply discharging and then recharging the battery several times. this power cycling will cause most of the crystals to redissolve back into the electrolyte. several companies offer this reconditioning service although battery users can purchase a reconditioner and recondition their own batteries. some batteries can be reconditioned without a special reconditioner by completely draining the battery using the battery powered device itself or a resistive circuit designed to safely discharge the battery and charging it as normal. the voltage profile of a battery is the relation ship of its voltage to the length of time it has been discharging or charging. in most primary batteries the voltage will drop steadily as the chemical reactions in the cell are diminished. this diminution leads to an almost-linear drop in voltage called a sloping profile. batteries with sloping voltage profiles provide power that is adequate for many applications such as flashlights flash cameras and portable radios. ni-cd batteries provide a relatively flat voltage profile. the cell's voltage will remain relatively constant for more than two-thirds of its discharge cycle. at some point near the end of the cycle the voltage drops sharply to nearly zero volts. batteries with this kind of profile are used for devices that require a relatively steady operating voltage. one disadvantage of using batteries with a flat voltage profile is that the batteries will need to be replaced almost immediately after a drop in voltage is noticed. if they are not immediately replaced the batteries will quickly cease to provide any useful energy. figure  shows the conceptual difference between a flat discharge rate and a sloping discharge rate. figure  sec.  shows actual voltage profiles for several common battery specifically designed for a near-infinite shelf life will slowly lose their charge over time even if they are not connected to a device. moisture in the air and the slight conductivity of the battery housing will serve as a path for electrons to travel to the cathode discharging the battery. the rate at which a battery loses power in this way is called the self-discharge rate. ni-cd batteries have a self-discharge rate of approximately  per day. ni-mh batteries have a much higher self-discharge rate of approximately  to  per day. these high discharge rates require that any such battery which has been stored for more than a month be charged before primary and secondary alkaline batteries have a self-discharge rate of approximately  to  per year meaning that such batteries can have a useful shelf life of several years. lithium batteries have a self-discharge rate of approximately  per month. as a general rule battery performance deteriorates gradually with a rise in temperature above  degrees c  degrees f and performance deteriorates rapidly at temperatures above  degrees c  degrees f. at very low temperatures  degrees c  degrees f to  degree c  degrees f battery performance is only a fraction of that at  degrees c  degrees f. figure  and figure  show the differences in energy density as a function of temperature. at low temperatures the loss of energy capacity is due to the reduced rate of chemical reactions and the increased internal resistance of the electrolyte. at high temperatures the loss of energy capacity is due to the increase of unwanted parasitic chemical reactions in the electrolyte. ni-cd batteries have a recommended temperature range of  degrees c  degrees f to  degrees c  degrees f. ni-mh have a recommended temperature range of  degree c  degrees f to  the cycle life of a battery is the number of cycles the battery can sustain with normal care and usage patterns before it can no longer hold a useful amount of charge. ni-cd batteries should have a normal cycle life of  to  recharge cycles. ni-mh batteries will have a cycle life of only  to  recharge cycles. as with all rechargeable batteries overcharging a ni-cd or ni-mh battery will significantly reduce the number of cycles it can sustain. many battery manufacturers recommend the constant-load test to determine the capacity of a battery. this test is conducted by connecting a predetermined load to the battery and then recording the amount of time needed to discharge the battery to a predetermined level. another recommended test is the intermittent-or switching-load test. in this type of test a predetermined load the battery for a specified period and then removed for another period. this load application and removal is repeated until the battery reaches a predetermined level of discharge. this kind of test simulates the battery usage of a portable radio. a comparison of these two kinds of tests was performed on five commonly available types of batteries. the data shows the five tested batteries all had a constant-load duration of  to  minutes which indicates that the five batteries had similar capacities. but intermittent-load testing of those same five batteries showed that the duration of the batteries ranged from . hours to  hours. there was no correlation of the results of the two tests meaning that batteries that performed best under constant-load testing did not necessarily perform well under intermittent-load testing. the study concluded that the ability of a battery to recover itself between heavy current drains cannot be made apparent through a constant-load test. .. battery technology comparison table  shows a comparison of some of the performance factors of several the initial capacity of a battery refers to the electrical output expressed in ampere-hours which the fresh fully charged battery can deliver to a specified load. the rated capacity is a designation of the total electrical output of the battery at typical discharge rates e.g. for each minute of radio transceiver operation  seconds shall be under a transmit current drain  seconds shall be under a receive current drain and  seconds shall be under a standby current drain. table . battery technology comparison adapted from design note: renewable reusable alkaline

times that the rechargeable battery can be charged and discharged before it becomes no longer able to hold or deliver any useful amount of energy. the initial cost is the relative cost of purchasing the battery. the life cycle cost is the per-use relative cost of the battery. table  shows a more detailed comparison of many of the available . selecting the right battery for the application batteries come in many different shapes sizes and compositions. there is no one ideal battery that can satisfy all possible requirements equally. different battery technologies have been developed that will optimize certain parameters for specific battery uses. in general the output of a battery is related only to its size and material composition. different battery designs and different manufacturing methods for the same type size and composition of battery will in general lead to only minor differences in the batteries electrical output. battery-industry standards have contributed to the fact that batteries of the same type composition and size different manufacturers are quite interchangeable. however the small differences that do exist between batteries made by different manufacturers can be significant when using a multi-cell array of matched cells. in these cases potential replacement cells must be graded to see if the cells properly match the capacity of the existing cells. even for non-matched multi-cell applications flashlights portable radios etc. it is still a good rule of thumb to avoid mixing batteries from different manufacturers within one device. small variances in voltage and current between different brands of battery can slightly shorten the useful do not mix batteries of different types e.g. do not mix rechargeable alkaline batteries with ni cd batteries within a single device within an figure shows discharge curves for several popular aa size battery types. two of the curves secondary alkaline st use and th use show that secondary alkaline batteries rapidly lose their capacity as they are used and recharged. only one ni-cd curve is shown since its curve remains essentially the same throughout most its life span. battery applications vary as do considerations for selecting the correct battery for each application. some of the important factors that customers might consider when selecting the right battery for a particular application  chemistry  kind of battery chemistry is best for the application? different chemistries will generate different voltages and  primary or secondary  primary batteries are most appropriate for applications where infrequent high-energy output is required. secondary batteries are most appropriate for use in devices that see steady periods of use and non-use pagers cellular phones etc..  standardization and availability  is there an existing battery design that meets the application needs? will replacement batteries be available in the future? using existing battery types is almost always preferable to specifying a custom-made battery design.  flexibility  can the battery provide high or low currents over a wide  temperature range  can the battery provide adequate power over the expected temperature range for the application?  good cycle life  how many times can the rechargeable battery be discharged and recharged before it becomes unusable?  costs  how expensive is the battery to purchase? does the battery  shelf life  how long can the battery be stored without loss of a significant amount of its power?  voltage  what is the voltage of the battery? most galvanic cells produce voltages of between . and . v.  safety  battery components range from inert to mildly corrosive to highly toxic or flammable. the more hazardous components will require  hidden costs  simpler manufacturing processes result in lower cost batteries. however if a battery contains toxic or hazardous components extra costs will be incurred to dispose of the battery safely after its use. table  shows a short list of different battery types and the kinds of application that are appropriate for each. all battery components when discarded contribute to the pollution of the environment. the components such as paperboard and carbon powder are relatively organic and can quickly merge into the ecosystem without noticeable impact. other components such as steel nickel and plastics while not actively toxic to the ecosystem will add to the volume of a landfill since they decompose slowly. table . recommended types for various usage conditions battery

discarded toxic to plants animals and humans. cadmium lead and mercury are the heavy-metal components most likely to be the target of environmental concerns. several of the major battery manufacturers have taken steps to reduce the amount of toxic materials in their batteries. one manufacturer reports the reduction of the mercury content of their most-popular battery from . in  to . in . other manufacturers report that their current battery formulas contain no mercury. the u.s. department of mines in  estimated that for the u.s. production of household batteries mercury usage had fallen from  tons in  to a projected  tons in . many of the major battery manufacturers have put significant efforts into the recycling of discarded batteries. according to one manufacturer it takes six to ten times more energy to recycle a battery than to create the battery components from virgin materials. efforts are underway that could improve the recycling technology to make recycling batteries much more energy efficient and cost effective. the use of secondary rechargeable batteries is more cost efficient than the use of primary batteries. such use will reduce the physical volume of discarded batteries in landfills because the batteries can be recharged and reused  to  times before they must be discarded. the most popular secondary batteries however contain cadmium. many manufacturers responding to customer requests and legislative demands are designing nickel-metal hydride lithium-ion and rechargeable-alkaline secondary batteries that contain only trace amounts of cadmium lead or existing off-the-shelf batteries are often preferred to batteries that require special design and manufacturing. some benefits of using off-the-shelf batteries are listed below:  the use of a proven design can reduce the risk of the battery not  the use of tested technology eliminates costly and time-consuming  the use of a proven design reduces unit production costs because of  the use of tested technology reduces operations and support costs through commonality of training documentation and replacement efforts. one method of estimating battery capacity requirements for a specific battery-powered device is to calculate the current drawn during the typical duty cycle for the device. standard duty cycles for battery service life and capacity determinations are standard  for land mobile radio communications and nij standard-. for hand held portable radio applications. specifically in an average  minute period of mobile-radio usage  seconds  is spent receiving  seconds  is spent transmitting and  seconds  is spent in idle mode. table  provides an example of a transceiver drawing an average current of .  .  .  . ma. for a typical duty cycle composed of  hours of operation followed by  hours of rest a minimum battery capacity of  mah is required. one manufacturer of portable communications equipment recommends that batteries be replaced if they fail to deliver  or more of their original rated capacity. below  batteries are usually found to deteriorate quickly. because a minimum requirement of  mah is  of the rated capacity of a  mah battery the latter should adequately provide power for the entire duty described. table . typical usage of portable telecommunications equipment. percent of duty cycle:   minutes of each hour current drain for mode:  ma average current for mode: . ma percent of duty cycle:   minutes of each hour current drain for mode:  ma average current for mode: . ma percent of duty cycle:   minutes of each hour current drain for mode:  ma average current for mode: . ma similar calculations can be performed for any battery in any battery-powered device by using the data relevant to the device and the proposed battery. the manufacturers should either provide such appropriate information with the batteries and devices or they should be able to provide those data on request. as reported above mobile radios have a typical duty cycle of  transmit  receive and  standby. the maximum current drain will occur during the transmit cycle. each radio typically will have a daily cycle of  hours of use and  hours of non-use. the non-use hours may be used to the radio's batteries. most commercial off-the-shelf mobile-radio units include battery. but since many radio units are in service  days a week  weeks a year and since the batteries are discharged and recharged daily each set of batteries should wear out approximately once two years  recharge cycles. replacement batteries purchased as directed user manual for the unit. most commercial off-the-shelf cellular phones contain a battery when purchased. charging units may be supplied with the phone or may be typical usage for cellular telephones will vary significantly with user but the estimate for mobile radio usage  of the duty cycle is spent in transmit mode  in receive mode and  in standby mode is also a reasonable estimate for cellular phone usage. at the end of each usage cycle the user places the battery phone on a recharging unit that will charge the battery for the next usage cycle. this usage pattern is appropriate for ni-cd or ni-mh batteries. ni-cd batteries should be completely discharged uses to prevent memory effects created by a recurring duty cycle. when a replacement or spare battery is needed only replacements recommended by the phone manufacturer should be used. batteries and battery systems from other manufacturers may be used if the batteries are certified to work with particular brand and model of phone. damage to the phone may result non certified batteries are used. several battery manufacturers make replacement battery packs that are designed to work a wide variety of cellular phones. because of the variety phones available battery manufacturers must design sell several dozen different batteries to fit the hundreds of models of cellular phones from dozens of manufacturers. the user is advised check battery

21	song by emily bront: the introduction of the poem describes a relaxed natural atmosphere that is marred by that fact that a lady is obliviously buried in the ground: wild deer are browsing above her breast. it is then revealed that this interred woman rests near the animals who she spent so much time with in life and who her smiles of love caressed. the same animals who left her solitude and continue on with their lives feeling no grief or pain at her parting. in contrast the lady's friends and lovers could not bear the idea of her death. when the lady's grave was fresh and unmarred and still her form retained the friends thought their hearts could ne'er recall the light of joy again and that the tide of grief would flow unchecked through future years. however as time passed the anguish and tears disappeared  much like the carefree animals. soon the living continue on to pursue pleasures shade and honours breath and best of all the dead lady does not care! the dweller in the land of death is changed and careless too. besides even if their eyes should watch and weep till sorrow's source were dry it would not make any difference to the dead: she would not in her tranquil sleep return a single sigh! in other words don't waste any breath or water on the dead they could not care less  they have no need of anything but the sweet song of the west-wind and summer-streams and there is nothing the living can do to soothe their dead dreams. powerwrite of song by emily bronte annotation of song by emily bronte summary of song by emily bronte

21	 an enemy or foe is an entity that is forcefully adverse to the person denoting it enemy. the term is usually used in war as a denomination of the side one is fighting. it may also be used about weather diseases and a host of other things the common connection being that they may cause injury or even death to those they oppose.
 enemies usually or perhaps always have conflicting or directly opposed objectives and goals  this state of conflict is typically why two sides regard each other as enemies.
 enemy is a strong word evoking associations of hate violence battle and war. the opposite of an enemy is a friend or ally the state of being or having an enemy is enmity.
 normally an entry in wikipedia like this would just refer to the wiktionary entry for this word. however the concept of an enemy is a large one and the concept deserves some historical treatment.
 the concept of the enemy is well covered in the field of peace studies which is availble as a a major at many major universities including a somewhat well-known program of study at american university in washington d.c..
 in peace studies enemies are those entities who are perceived as frustrating or preventing achievement of a goal. the enemy may not even know they are being regarded as such since the concept is one-sided.
 thus in order to achieve peace one must eliminate the enemy. this can be achieved by either by:
  changing one's perception of an entity as enemy or
  by achieving the goal the enemy is frustrating.
 personal conflicts are frequently either unexamined ones goals are not well defined or examined only from one point of view. this means it is often possible to resolve conflict to eliminate the enemy by redefining goals such that the frustruation not the person is either eliminated obvious negotiated away or decided upon.
 common parlance says that peace is a lack of conflict. peace is more than that peace is a state where conflicts are resolved in orderly predictable ways that do not involve harming people. conflicts are normal however and are good since a world without conflict would be very very boring. where enemies are people there is no peace. where enemies are injustice iniquity disease and the ideologies themselves not the holders of them there can be peace.
 :the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
 :perfect is the enemy of done.

21	hello edit here id just like to solve this specific paradox. epimenides does not represent all cretans. he himself is only one man therefore if he is lying about his statement then he is alone lying which makes his statement false all cretans are not liars. the point of this is paradox is saying epimenides is a cretan so if he is lying about his statement it means he is telling the truth causing the paraffox. this however is not what actually happens. epimenides a single cretan is not all cretans therefore he alone is lying making his statement false. 
21	galatians. also the incident mentioned by paul in galatians with peter for which paul rebukes peter publicly was not as likely to happen after such a large apostolic concensus of acts  that gentiles need not be circumcised into the law of moses. otherwise paul would not have accused peter who wasn't living like a jew of forcing gentiles to obey jewish customs. 
21	it is interesting to note that this is one of the few epistles in the bible that has no distinct author. yet there is good reason for this. if paul had written it it was not becoming that he should write paul an apostle of jesus christ.. in the introduction because jesus christ is seen as the apostle in this epistle. hebrews : wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our confession jesus. 
21	the primary messages conveyed by the book of romans are thus: . foreskin does not have to be removed from the male body. . previously forbidden foods may be eaten. e.g. pork or shellfish may be consumed. . those who are not descendant genetically from abraham now have a place in heaven although they are next in line after the jewish peoples. 
21	for ten years before writing the letter approx.  paul had travelled round the territories bordering the aegean sea evangelising. churches had been planted in the roman provinces of galatia macedonia roman achaea roman and asia roman paul considering his task complete wanted to preach the gospel in spain where he would not build upon another mans bruce  this allowed him to visit rome on the way an ambition of his for a long time. the letter to the romans in part prepares them and gives reasons for his visit.bruce  in addition to pauls geographic location his religious views are important. first paul was a hellenistic jew with a pharisaic background integral to his identity. his concern for his people is one part of the dialogue and runs throughout the letter.dunn xxix-xli second the other side of the dialogue is conversion of conversion and calling to follow christ in the early 30s. the resulting evangelistic activity dominated the later years of pauls life. the letter therefore interweaves the concerns of paul the pharisee and the follower of christ.dunn xli xlii third pauls missionary work caused opposition from jews and fellow jewish christians. one issue was whether jewish christians should continue to carry out laws placed on the covenant people regarding things such as food laws and circumcision controversy in early the disagreement was partly between paul and the jerusalem church including figures such as saint see incident at antioch barnabas who sided with peter and james the just who issued the apostolic decree see also paul of tarsus and judaism. pauls upcoming visit to jerusalem to deliver a collection from the gentiles was therefore an attempt to help maintain the unity of the christian movement. the letter to the romans written during this time includes pauls hopes and fears regarding his visit to jerusalem and the relationship between gentiles and more traditional jewish christians.dunn xlii-xliii 
21	the letter was most probably written while paul was in corinth and probably while he was staying in the house of gaius and transcribed by tertius his amanuensis.dunn xliv stuhlmacher  there are a number of reasons corinth is most plausible. paul was about to travel to jerusalem on writing the letter which matches acts where it is reported that paul stayed for three months in greece. this probably implies corinth as it was the location of pauls greatest missionary success in greece.dunn xliv additionally phoebe christian was a deacon of the church in cenchreae a port to the east of corinth and would have been able to convey the letter to rome after passing through corinth and taking a ship from corinths west port.dunn xliv erastus mentioned in also lived in corinth being the cities commissioner for public works and city treasurer at various times again indicating that the letter was written in corinth.bruce  dunn xliv the precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in the epistle but it was obviously written when the collection for jerusalem had been assembled and paul was about to go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints that is at the close of his second visit to greece during the winter preceding his last visit to that city cf. bibleverse the majority of scholars writing on romans propose the letter was written in late  or late .bruce  dunn xliii early  and early  both have some support while luedemann argues for a date as early as or following on from knox who proposed . luedemann is the only serious challenge to the consensus of mid to late 50s.dunn, xliii xliv 
21	 the erdoumls number of a mathematician is determined as follows:
 paul erdoumls has an erdoumls number of zero.
 the erdoumls number of mathematician m is defined to be the minimum of the erdoumls numbers of all the mathematicians that m coauthored a mathematical paper with plus one.
 the erdos number honours the late hungarian mathematician paul erdoumls who was one of the most prolific publishers of papers in mathematical history. he wrote around  mathematical articles in his lifetime mostly co-authored with other persons. he had about  collaborators these are the people with erdoumls number .
 erds numbers have been a part of the folklore of mathematicians throughout the world for many years. amongst all working mathematicians at the turn of the millennium the numbers range up to  but the average is less than  and almost everyone with a finite erds number has a number less than .
 some take the erdos number seriously as a map of which mathematicians trusted the reputations and methods of which other mathematicians enough to publish papers with them. this may reflect the similarity of their mathematical practices particularly important in the study of quasi-empiricism in mathematics itself part of the philosophy of mathematics. some current activities of this nature include:
 jerry grossman marc lipman and eddie cheng have been looking at some questions in pure graph theory motivated by the collaboration graph. this suggests that the network is itself driving new theory.
 also michael barr suggests rational erds numbers generalizing the idea that a person who has written p joint papers with erds should be assigned erds number from the collaboration multigraph of the second kind although he also has a way to deal with the case of the first kind  with one edge between two authors for each joint paper they have produced  form an electrical network with a one-ohm resistor on each edge. the total resistance between two nodes tells how close these two nodes are. this would also form an analog physical basis modelling trust between all working mathematicians. this might be a major contribution to the cognitive science of mathematics  providing a simple physical metaphor to bridge the gap between the trust in one mathematician's cognition and that of them all.
 the bacon number is an application of the same idea to the movie industry. it is less clear to what degree actors appearing in films with each other implies trust although it likely implies shared reputation.

can develop over time and can lead to long-term disability.ergonomics is the scientific discipline concerned with designing according to the human needs and the profession that applies theory principles data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance.  the field is also called human engineering and human factors. ergonomic research is performed by those who study human capabilities in relationship to their work demands. information derived from these studies contributes to the design and evaluation of tasks jobs products environments and systems in order to make them compatible with the needs abilities and limitations of people. . five aspects of ergonomics . design of ergonomics experiments . ergonomics in the workplace  fields of ergonomics ergonomics is a science concerned with the fit between people and their work. it takes account of the worker's capabilities and limitations in seeking to ensure that tasks equipment information and the environment suit each worker. to assess the fit between a person and their work ergonomists consider the job being done and the demands on the worker the equipment used its size shape and how appropriate it is for the task and the information used how it is presented accessed and changed. ergonomics draws on many disciplines in its study of humans and their environments including anthropometry biomechanics mechanical engineering industrial engineering industrial design kinesiology physiology and psychology. typically an ergonomist will have a ba or bs in psychology engineering or health sciences and usually an ma ms or phd in a related discipline. many universities offer master of science degrees in ergonomics while some offer master of ergonomics or master of human factors degrees. in the 2000s, occupational therapists have been moving into the field of ergonomics and the field has been heralded as one of the top ten emerging practice areas.if

based on these aspects of ergonomics examples are given of how products or systems could benefit from redesign based on ergonomic principles. safety  medicine bottles: the print on them could be larger so that a sick person who may have impaired vision due to sinuses etc. can more easily see the dosages and label. ergonomics could design the print style color and size for optimal viewing. comfort  alarm clock display: some displays are harshly bright drawing ones eye to the light when surroundings are dark. ergonomic principles could redesign this based on contrast principles. ease of use  street signs: in a strange area many times it is difficult to spot street signs. this could be addressed with the principles of visual detection in ergonomics.  hd tv: the sound on hd tv is much lower than regular tv. so when you switch from hd to regular the volume increases dramatically. ergonomics recognizes that this difference in decibel level creates a difference in loudness and hurts human ears and this could be solved by evening out the decibel levels. voicemail instructions: it takes too long to have to listen to all of the obvious instructions. ergonomics could address this by providing more options to the user enabling them to easily and quickly skip the instructions. aesthetics  signs in the workplace: signage should be made consistent throughout the workplace to not only be aesthetically pleasing but also so that information is easily accessible for all signs the international ergonomics association iea divides ergonomics broadly into three domains: physical ergonomics: is concerned with human anatomical anthropometric physiological and biomechanical characteristics as they relate to physical activity. relevant topics include working postures materials handling repetitive movements work related musculoskeletal disorders workplace layout safety and health. cognitive ergonomics: is concerned with mental processes such as perception memory reasoning and motor response as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system. relevant topics include mental workload decision-making skilled performance human-computer interaction human

structures policies and processes.relevant topics include communication crew resource management work design design of working times teamwork participatory design community ergonomics cooperative work new work paradigms virtual organizations telework and quality management. the foundations of the science of ergonomics appear to have been laid within the context of the culture of ancient greece. a good deal of evidence indicates that hellenic civilization in the 5th century bce used ergonomic principles in the design of their tools jobs and workplaces. one outstanding example of this can be found in the description hippocrates gave of how a surgeon's workplace should be designed see marmaras poulakakis and papakostopoulos  . the term ergonomics is derived from the greek words ergon work and nomos natural laws and first entered the modern lexicon when wojciech jastrzbowski used the word in his  article rys ergonomji czyli nauki o pracy opartej na prawdach poczerpnitych z nauki przyrody the outline of ergonomics i.e. science of work based on the truths taken from the natural science. later in the 19th century frederick winslow taylor pioneered the scientific management method which proposed a way to find the optimum method for carrying out a given task. taylor found that he could for example triple the amount of coal that workers were shoveling by incrementally reducing the size and weight of coal shovels until the fastest shoveling rate was reached. frank and lillian gilbreth expanded taylor's methods in the early 1900s to develop time and motion studies. they aimed to improve efficiency by eliminating unnecessary steps and actions. by applying this approach the gilbreths reduced the number of motions in bricklaying from  to . allowing bricklayers to increase their productivity from  to  bricks per hour. world war ii marked the development of new and complex machines and weaponry and these made new demands on operators cognition. the decision-making attention situational awareness and hand-eye coordination of the machine's operator became key in the success or failure of a task. it was observed that fully functional aircraft flown by the best-trained pilots still crashed. in  alphonse chapanis a lieutenant in the u.s. army showed that this so called pilot error could be greatly reduced when more logical and differentiable controls replaced confusing designs in airplane cockpits. in the decades since the war ergonomics has continued to flourish and diversify. the space age created new human factors issues such as weightlessness and extreme g-forces. how far could environments in space be tolerated and what effects would they have on the mind and body? the dawn of the information age has resulted in the new ergonomics field of human-computer interaction hci. likewise the growing demand for and competition among consumer goods and electronics has resulted in more companies including human factors in product design. at home work or play new problems and questions must be resolved constantly. people come in all different shapes and sizes and with different capabilities and limitations in strength speed judgment and skills. all of these factors need to be considered in the design function. to solve design problems physiology and psychology must be included with a engineering approach. ergonomic

ergonomics. human factors engineering continues to be successfully applied in the fields of aerospace aging health care it product design transportation training nuclear and virtual environments among others. kim vicente a university of toronto professor of ergonomics argues that the nuclear disaster in chernobyl is attributable to plant designers not paying enough attention to human factors. the operators were trained but the complexity of the reactor and the control panels nevertheless outstripped their ability to grasp what they were seeing during the prelude to the disaster. physical ergonomics is important in the medical field particularly to those diagnosed with physiological ailments or disorders such as arthritis both chronic and temporary or carpal tunnel syndrome. pressure that is insignificant or imperceptible to those unaffected by these disorders may be very painful or render a device unusable for those who are. many ergonomically designed products are also used or recommended to treat or prevent such disorders and to treat pressure-related chronic pain. human factors issues arise in simple systems and consumer products as well. some examples include cellular telephones and other handheld devices that continue to shrink yet grow more complex a phenomenon referred to as creeping featurism millions of vcrs blinking : across the world because very few people can figure out how to program them or alarm clocks that allow sleepy users to inadvertently turn off the alarm when they mean to hit snooze. a user-centered design ucd also known as a systems approach or the usability engineering lifecycle aims to improve the user-system. edit design of ergonomics experiments there is a specific series of steps that should be used in order to properly design an ergonomics experiment. first one should select a problem that has practical impact. the problem should support or test a current theory. the user should select one or a few dependent variables which usually measures safety health physiological performance. independent variables should also be chosen at different levels. normally this involves paid participants the existing environment equipment software. when testing the users one should give careful instructions describing the method or task and then get voluntary consent. the user should recognize all the possible combinations and interactions to notice the many differences that could occur. multiple observations and trials should be conducted and compared to maximize the best results. once completed redesigning within and between subjects should be done to vary the data. it is often that permission is needed from the institutional review board before an experiment can be done. a mathematical model should be used so that the data will be clear once the experiment is completed. the experiment starts with a pilot test. make sure in advance that the subjects understand the test the equipment works and that the test is able to be finished within the given time. when the experiment actually begins the subjects should be paid for their work. all times and other measurements should be carefully measured and recorded. once all the data is compiled it should be analyzed reduced and formatted in the right way. a report explaining the experiment should be written. it should often display statistics including an anova table plots and means of central tendency. a final paper should be written and edited after numerous drafts to ensure an adequate report is the final product. edit ergonomics in the workplace fundamentals for the flexible workplace variability and compatibility with desk components that flex from individual work activities to team settings. workstations provide supportive ergonomics for task-intensive environments.outside of the discipline itself the term ergonomics is generally used to refer to physical ergonomics as it relates to the workplace as in for example ergonomic chairs and keyboards. ergonomics in the workplace has to do largely with the safety of employees both long and short term. ergonomics can help reduce costs by improving safety. this would decrease the money paid out in workers compensation. for example over five million workers sustain overextension injuries per year. through ergonomics workplaces can be designed so that workers do not have to overextend themselves and the manufacturing industry could save billions in workers compensation. workplaces may either take the reactive or proactive approach when applying ergonomics practices. reactive ergonomics is when something needs to be fixed and corrective action is taken. proactive ergonomics is the process of seeking areas that could be improved and fixing the issues before they become a large problem. problems may be fixed through equipment design or task design. equipment design changes the actual physical devices used by people. task design changes what people do with the equipment. environmental design changes the environment in which people work but not the physical equipment they use. edit fields of ergonomics engineering psychology is an interdisciplinary part of ergonomics and studies the relationships of people to machines with the intent of improving such relationships. this may involve redesigning equipment changing the way people use machines or changing the location in which the work takes place. often the work of an engineering psychologist is described as making the relationship more user-friendly. engineering psychology is an applied field of psychology concerned with psychological factors in the design and use of equipment. human factors is broader than engineering psychology which is focused specifically on designing systems that accommodate the information-processing capabilities of the brain. macroergonomics is an approach to ergonomics that emphasizes a broad system view of design examining organizational environments culture history and work goals. it deals with the physical design of tools and the environment. it is the study of the interface and their consequences for relationships processes and institutions. it also deals with the optimization of the designs of organizational and work systems through the consideration of personnel technological and environmental variables and their interactions. the goal of macroergonomics is a completely efficient work system at both the macro and micro-ergonomic level which results in improved productivity and employee satisfaction health safety and commitment. it analyzes the whole system finds how each element should be placed in the system and considers all aspects for a fully efficient system. a misplaced element in the system can lead to total failure. macroergonomics also known as organizational design and management factors deals with the overall design of work systems. this domain did not begin to receive recognition as a sub-discipline of ergonomics until the beginning of the 1980s. the idea and current perspective of the discipline was the work of the u.s. human factors society select committee on the future of human factors . this committee was formed to analyze trends in all aspects of life and to look at how they would impact ergonomics over the following  years. the developments they found include: breakthroughs in technology that would change the nature of work such as the desktop computer the need for organizations to adapt to the expectations and needs of this more mature workforce differences between the post-world war ii generation and the older generation regarding their expectations the nature of the new workplace the inability of solely microergonomics to achieve reductions in lost-time accidents and injuries and increases in productivity increasing workplace liability litigation based on safety design deficiencies. these predictions have become and continue to become reality. the macroergonomic intervention in the workplace has been particularly effective in establishing a work culture that promotes and sustains performance and safety improvements. cognitive walk-through method: this method is a usability inspection method in which the evaluators can apply user perspective to task scenarios to identify design problems. as applied to macroergonomics evaluators are able to analyze the usability of work system designs to identify how well a work system is organized and how well the workflow is integrated. kansei method: this is a method that transforms consumers responses to new products into design specifications. as applied to macroergonomics this method can translate employees responses to changes to a work system into design specifications. high integration of technology organization and people hitop: this is a manual procedure done step-by-step to apply technological change to the workplace. it allows managers to be more aware of the human and organizational aspects of their technology plans allowing them to efficiently integrate technology in these contexts. top modeler: this model helps manufacturing companies identify the organizational changes needed when new technologies are being considered for their process. computer-integrated manufacturing organization and people system design cimop: this model allows for evaluating computer-integrated manufacturing organization and people system design based on knowledge of the system. anthropotechnology: this method considers analysis and design modification of systems for the efficient transfer of technology from one culture to another. systems analysis tool sat: this is a method to conduct systematic trade-off evaluations of work-system intervention alternatives. macroergonomic analysis of structure mas: this method analyzes the structure of work systems according to their compatibility with unique sociotechnical aspects. macroergonomic analysis and design mead: this method assesses work-system processes by using a ten-step process. the best way to reduce pressure in the back is to be in a standing position. however there are times when you need to sit. when sitting the main part of the body weight is transferred to the seat. some weight is also transferred to the floor back rest and armrests. where the weight is transferred is the key to a good seat design. when the proper areas are not supported sitting in a seat all day can put unwanted pressure on the back causing pain. the lumbar bottom five vertebrate in the spine needs to be supported to decrease disc pressure. providing both a seat back that inclines backwards and has a lumbar support is critical to prevent excessive low back pressures. the combination which minimizes pressure on the lower back is having a backrest inclination of  degrees and a lumbar support of  cm. the  degrees inclination means the angle between the seat and the backrest should be  degrees. the lumbar support of  cm means the chair backrest supports the lumbar by sticking out  cm in the lower back area. another key to reducing lumbar disc pressure is the use of armrests. they help by putting the force of your body not entirely on the seat and back rest but putting some of this pressure on the armrests. armrest needs to be adjustable in height to assure shoulders are not overstressed. international the society of automotive engineers sae is a professional organization for mobility engineering professionals in the aerospace automotive and commercial vehicle industries. the society is a standards development organization for the engineering of powered vehicles of all kinds including cars trucks boats aircraft and others. the society of automotive engineers has established a number of standards used in the automotive industry and elsewhere. it encourages the design of vehicles in accordance with established human factors principles. it is one the most influential organizations with respect to ergonomics work in automotive design. this society regularly holds conferences which address topics spanning all aspects of human needed in the uk the professional body

21	centerfor other meanings of eta see basque paramilitary the basque people separate from neighboring spain and france. in the basque language euskara euskadi ta askatasuna translates to basque fatherland and liberty or basque country and liberty. eta is officially considered a terrorist organization by the united states and the european union. its symbol is a snake wrapped around an axe. eta's motto is bietan jarrai keep up on both referring to the two figures in the symbol symbols of snake and strength axe. the organization was founded in  and changed rapidly from a group advocating traditional cultural ways to an armed resistance movement which fought a guerrilla war against the spanish security forces. this change was motivated by francisco francisco franco's oppression of the basques. eta forms part of what is known as the basque national liberation movement spanish: movimiento de liberacin nacional vasco mlnv consisting of several distinct organizations embracing left basque basque nationalist politics spanish: izquierda nacionalista vasca basque: ezker abertzale often seen in the mixed language izquierda abertzale. among these are eta batasuna euskal herritarrok herri batasuna and the associated youth group haika previously known as jarrai then segi the union lab gestoras pro amnista and others. all of these are generally identified with the kas alternative described in the next section. eta is believed to be financed principally by a so-called revolutionary tax paid by many businesses in the basque country and enforced by the threat of assassination. they also people for ransom and have occasionally burgled or robbed storehouses of explosives. during the franco era eta had considerable public support even beyond the basque populace but spain's transition to democracy and eta's progressive radicalization have resulted in a steady loss of support which became especially patent at the time of their  kidnapping and assassination of miguel ngel blanco. their loss of sympathizers has been reflected in an erosion of support for the political parties identified with the mlnv. in recent years their supporters are clearly a minority in the basque region. according to the euskobarmetro a statistical of various matters in the basque country conducted by the universidad del pas vasco as of of may  a significant number of basques support some or all of eta's goals but few support their violent methods:   favor basque independence  federalism  autonomy  centralism.  undecided or not answering asked whether they agree or disagree with the statement today in euskadi it is possible to defend all political aspirations and objectives without the necessity of resorting to violence  agree and  disagree  undecided or not answering. in fact  of those who identify politically with batasuna actively agreed with the statement. asked directly about their views of eta  rejected eta totally and another  identified themselves as former eta sympathizers who no longer support the group. another  agreed with eta's ends but not their means.  said that their attitude towards eta was mainly one of fear  indifference. only  all identified with batasuna gave eta support even as mild as justified with criticism.  were undecided or did not answer. even within batasuna  rejected eta's violence. the poll does not cover navarre where basque nationalism is weaker. in general eta has two demands:  that an independent socialist government be created in basque-inhabited areas of spain and france euskal herria. in spain these are known collectively as the basque country and include both the basque country autonomous autnoma vasca autonomous basque community mdash consisting of the provinces of vizcaya bizkaia guipzcoa gipuzkoa lava araba mdash and province of navarre nafarroa which alone constitutes the comunidad foral de navarra navarese community under fueros. the basque-inhabited areas in france are known collectively as the french basque country and include lower navarre labourd lapurdi and soule zuberoa all located in southwestern france in the dpartement of pyrnes-atlantiques.  that imprisoned eta members currently awaiting trial or serving prison sentences in spain be released. during the 1980s, the basque revolutionary left summarized its claims in the kas alternative. four decades after the creation of eta the idea of creating a socialist state in the basque country has begun to seem off balance utopian and impractical. hence eta has adjusted its agenda by opening up to new possibilities as reflected in the  democratic alternative which offered the cessation of all armed eta activity if the spanish-government would recognize the basque people as having sovereignty over basque territory and the right to self-determination. other demands of the group are:  that the spanish government relocate imprisoned eta members closer to the basque country and their families.  to have a referendum on self-determination following the quebec example where the basque country would decide whether they want to remain a spain or not. the organization has adopted other tactical causes such as fighting against:  alleged drug traffickers as corruptors of basque youth and police collaborators.  the nuclear power plant project at lemoiz.  the leizaran highway. eta is organized into distinct talde groups whose objective is to conduct operations in a specific geographic zone collectively they are coordinated by the cpula militar military cupola. in addition they maintain safe houses and zulo-s caches of arms or explosives the basque word zulo literally means hole among its members eta distinguishes between legalak those members who do not have police files liberados exiled to france and quemados freed after having been imprisoned. the internal organ of eta is zutik standing. eta's tactics of intimidation include: assassination and murder especially via car bombs or via a gunshot to the nape of the neck. anonymous threats often delivered in the basque country by placards or graffiti and which have forced many people into hiding an example was the harassment of onetime juan mara atutxa when he served as head of the department of justice for the basque country. the so-called revolutionary tax. kidnapping often as a punishment for failing to pay the revolutionary tax. eta operates mainly in spain particularly in the basque country navarre and to a lesser degree madrid barcelona and the tourist areas of the coast of spain. recently they sometimes attack civilian targets but have usually focused on military targets. however eta has included both police and politicians in their definition of the military. as of  eta has killed over  people and the range of their victims has broadened over the years targets have included among others: luis carrero blanco president government under franco  members of the army and the security forces of the spanish state including guardia civil polica nacional and police of the autonomous regions such as the ertzaintza basque police or mossos d'esquadra the police force of catalonia. businessmen such as javier ybarra. funcionaries of the prison and judicial systems. university professors such as francisco toms y valiente killed in . journalists such as jos luis lpez de la calle killed in may . members of certain religious and social groups. foreign tourists in spain. before bombings eta members often make a telephone call so that people can be evacuated. sometimes the calls give incorrect information resulting in the deaths of police or civilians. an estimated people have been killed in eta's attacks since the 1960s. a police file dating from  indicated that eta needs about  million pesetas about  euros daily in order to finance its operations. although eta used robbery as a means of financing in its early days it has since been accused both of arms trafficking and of benefiting economically from its political counterpart batasuna. the two most important methods that the organization has used to obtain finances are kidnapping and extortion euphemistically known as revolutionary taxes. other similar organizations such as farc have also used this tactic. in  the judge baltasar garzn seized the herriko tabernas peoples taverns which were reportedly collecting these revolutionary taxes. eta is known to have had contacts with the irish republican army the two groups have both at times characterized their struggles as parallel to one another. it has also had links with other militant left-wing movements in europe and in other places throughout the world. because of its allegiance to ideas eta has in the past been sponsored by regimes such as cuba as well as by libya and lebanon. some of its members have found political asylum in mexico and venezuela. source: spanish ministrybr the interior  eta has conducted many high-profile attacks over the years. among the most significant have been:  : first eta attack an unsuccessful attempt to derail a train.  : melitn manzanas a secret police chief an alleged torturer in the basque city of san sebastian is killed in

the french government especially during the franco dictatorship when eta members were often regarded as political refugees in recent years the french have been extremely active against eta. a number of eta members have been captured on french soil and extradited to spain to stand trial. during the 1970s and the 1980s, eta members and its suspected supporters had been the target of right-wing and state terrorism such as gal. several eta members were death during the franco era. eta's political wing is batasuna formerly known as euskal herritarrok and herri batasuna which generally receives about  of the vote in the basque areas of spain. batasuna's political status has been a very controversial issue. the spanish cortes parliament began the process of declaring the party illegal in august  a move which was strongly disputed by many who felt that it was too draconian. judge baltasar garzn suspended the activities of batasuna in a parallel trial investigating the relationship between batasuna and eta and its headquarters were shut down by police. the supreme court of spain finally declared batasuna illegal on march  . the court considered proven that batasuna had several links with eta and that it was in fact part of eta. batasuna was listed as a terrorist organization by the united states in may  and by all european countries in june . in spain all members of parliament not belonging to batasuna or any of the independentist political parties are required to carry a permanent escort lest they should be attacked by eta. this also extends to all basque city councilors of non-basque-nationalist parties and several of the basque nationalist officials. eta was founded by young nationalists initially affiliated with the pnv. started in  as a student discussion group at the university of deusto in bilbao an offshoot of the pnv's youth group egi it was originally called ekin from the basque-language verb meaning to act the name had the meaning get busy. on july   it reconstituted itself as eta. their split from the pnv was apparently because they considered the pnv too moderate in its opposition to franco's dictatorship. they disagreed with the pnv's rejection of violent tactics and advocated a basque resistance movement utilizing direct action. this was an era of wars of national liberation such as the war in algeria. in their platform formed at their first assembly in bayonne france in  eta called for historical regenerationism considering basque history as a process of construction of a nation. they declared that basque nationality is defined by the basque language euskara this was in contrast to the pnv's definition of basque nationality in terms of ethnicity. in contrast with the explicit catholicism of the pnv eta defined itself as aconfessional religiously pluralistic rejecting the hierarchy of the roman catholic church although catholic doctrine elaborate its social program. they called for socialism and for independence for euskadi compatible with european federalism. in  eta adopted a position its precise political line has varied with time although they have always advocated some type of socialism. in its early years eta's activity seems to have consisted mostly of theorizing and of protesting by destroying infrastructure and spanish symbols and by hanging forbidden basque flags. it is not possible to say when eta first began a policy of assassination nor is it clear who committed the first assassinations identified with eta. there are sources that say the first was the june   death of a month-old child begoa urroz ibarrola who died in a bombing in san sebastin other sources single out a failed  attempt to derail a train carrying war veterans others point to the unpremeditated june   killing of a guardia civil civil jos pardines arcay by eta member xabi etxebarrieta: the policeman had halted etxebarrieta's car for a road check. etxebarrieta was soon killed by the spanish police leading to retaliation in the form of the first eta assassination with major repercussions was that of melitn manzanas chief of the secret police in san sebastin and a suspected torturer. in  several members of eta were condemned to death in the proceso de burgos trial of burgos but international pressure resulted in commutation of the sentences which however had by that time already been applied to some other members of eta. the most consequential assassination performed by eta during franco's dictatorship was the december  assassination by bomb in madrid of admiral luis carrero blanco franco's chosen successor and president of the government a position roughly equivalent to being a prime minister. this killing committed as a reprisal for the execution of basque independentistas was widely applauded by the spanish opposition in exile. after franco's death during spain's to democracy eta split into two separate organizations: the majority became eta political-military or etapm the minority eta military or etam. etapm accepted the spanish government's offer of amnesty to all eta prisoners even those who had committed violent crimes abandoned the policy of violence and integrated into the political party euskadiko ezkerra left-wing of the basque country which years later split. one faction retained the name euskadiko ezkerra for some years before merging into the partido socialista de euskadi pse the basque affiliate of the national psoe the other became euskal ezkerra eue basque left and then merged into eusko alkartasuna. some of the former eta members like mario onainda jon juaristi joseba pagazaurtundua evolved to non-nationalist leftism or even spanish nationalism thus becoming targets or victims for eta. meanwhile etam which again became known simply as eta adopted even more radical and violent positions. the years were to prove eta's most deadly with   and  fatalities respectively. martinez-herrera  during the franco era eta was able to take advantage of toleration by the government which allowed its members to move freely through french territory believing that in this manner they were contributing to the end of franco's regime. there is much controversy over the degree to which this policy of sanctuary continued even after the transition to democracy but it is generally agreed that currently the french authorities collaborate closely with the spanish government against eta. eta performed their first car bomb assassination in madrid in september  resulting in one death and  injuries another bomb in july  killed  members of the guardia civil and injured  on july   the hipercor bombing was an attack in a shopping center in barcelona killing  and injuring  in the last case several entire families were killed. eta claimed in a communique that they had given advance warning of the hipercor bomb but that the police had declined to evacuate the area. in a dirty war against eta grupos antiterroristas de liberacin gal antiterrorist liberation groups a government-sponsored and supposedly counter-terrorist organization active and possibly later committed assassinations kidnappings and torture not only of eta members but of civilians some of whom turned out to have nothing to do with eta. in  a spanish court convicted and imprisoned several individuals involved in gal not only footsoldiers but politicians up to the highest levels of government including a minister of the interior. major cases of foul play on part of the spanish government after  have been proven in court although eta supporters routinely claim human rights violations and torture by security forces and international human rights organizations have backed some of these claims. in  gesto por la paz known in english as association for peace in the basque country was founded they began to convene silent demonstrations in communities throughout the basque country the day after any violent killing whether by eta or by gal. these were the first systematic demonstrations in the basque country against terrorist violence. also in  in ordizia eta assassinated mara dolores katarain known as yoyes the former director of eta who had abandoned armed struggle and rejoined civil society: they accused her of desertion. january   all basque political parties except the eta affiliated batasuna signed the ajuria-enea pact with the intent of ending eta's violence. weeks later on january  eta announced a day ceasefire later prolonged several times. a negotiation in algeria known as the mesa de argel algiers table was attempted between eta represented by eugenio etxebeste antxon and the then current psoe government of spain but no successful conclusion was reached and eta eventually resumed the use of violence. during this period the spanish government had a policy referred to as reinsertion under which imprisoned eta members who the government believed had genuinely abandoned violent intent could be freed and allowed to rejoin society. claiming a need to prevent eta from coercively impeding this reinsertion the psoe government decided that imprisoned eta members who previously had all been imprisoned within the basque country would instead be dispersed to prisons throughout spain some as far from their families as in the salto del negro prison in the canary islands. france has taken a similar approach. in the event the only clear effect of this policy was to incite social protest especially from nationalists over the supposed illegality of the policy itself. another spanish counter-terrorist law puts suspected terrorist cases under the the specialized tribunal audiencia nacional in madrid. suspected terrorists are subject to a habeas corpus term longer than other suspects. in  eta's three top leaders mdash military leader francisco mujika garmendia pakito political leader jos luis alvarez santacristina txelis and logistical leader jos mara arregi erostarbe fiti often referred to collectively as the cupola of eta or as the artapalo collective mdash were arrested in the french basque town of bidart which led to changes in eta's leadership and direction. after a two-month truce eta adopted even more radical positions. the principal consequence of the change appears to have been the creation of the y groups young people generally minor dedicated to so-called kale borroka mdash street struggle mdash and whose activities included burning buses street lamps benches automatic teller garbage containers etc. and throwing molotov cocktails. the appearance of these groups was attributed by many to supposed weakness of eta which obligated them to resort to minors to maintain or augment their impact on society after arrests of leading militants including the cupola. eta also began to menace leaders of other parties besides rival basque parties. the existence the y groups as an organized phenomenon has been contested by some supporters of basque national liberation who claim that this construction is merely a trumped-up excuse to give longer prison sentences to those convicted of street violence. in  the armed organization again launched a peace proposal. the so called democratic alternative replaced the earlier kas alternative as a minimum proposal for the establishment of euskal herria. the democratic alternative offered the cessation of all armed eta activity if the spanish government would recognize the basque people as having sovereignty over basque territory and the right to self-determination. the spanish government ultimately rejected this peace offer. also in  came a failed eta car bombing attempt directed against jos mara aznar a politician who was leader of the then-opposition people's party popular pp and was shortly after elected to the presidency of the government their was also an abortive attempt in majorca on the life of king juan carlos i of carlos i. still the act with the largest social impact came the following year. july   pp activist miguel ngel blanco was kidnapped in the basque city of ermua and his death threatened unless the spanish government would meet eta's demands. six million people demonstrated to demand his liberation with demonstrations occurring as much in the basque regions as elsewhere in spain. after three days eta carried through their threat unleashing massive demonstrations reflecting the eta action with the cries of assassins and basques yes eta no. this response came to be known as the spirit of ermua. after the good friday accord marked the beginning of the end of violent hostilities in northern ireland and given that the ajuria-enea pact had failed to bring peace to the basque country the pact brought together political parties unions and other basque groups in hopes again of changing the political situation. shortly after september   eta declared a unilateral truce or ceasefire and began a process of dialogue with spain's pp government. the dialogue continued for some time but eta resumed assassinations in  accusing the government of being inflexible and of not wanting dialogue. the communique that declared the end of the truce cited the failure of the process initiated in the pact to achieve political change as the reason for the return to violence. the spanish government from the highest levels accused eta of having declared a false truce in order to rearm. later came acts of violence such as the november   car bomb in madrid which injured  and attacks on soccer stadiums and tourist destinations. the september    attacks appear do have dealt a hard blow to eta owing to the toughening of antiterrorist measures such as the freezing of bank accounts the increase in international police coordination and the end of the toleration some countries had up until then extended to eta. in addition in  the basque nationalist youth movement jarrai was outlawed and the law of parties was changed outlawing herri batasuna the political arm of eta although even before the change in law batasuna had been lagely paralyzed and under judicial investigation by judge baltasar garzn. with ever-increasing frequency attempted eta actions have been frustrated by spanish security forces. on christmas eve  in san sebastin and in hernani national police arrested two eta members who had left dynamite in a railroad car prepared explode in chamartn station in madrid. on march   in a place between alcal de henares and madrid a light truck with  kg of explosives was left to cause a massacre but was prevented by the action of the guardia civiacutel. february   eta publicly stated that a ceasefire only in catalonia had been in effect since january  based on a desire to unite the ties between the basque and catalan peoples. some claimed that this ceasefire was based on a secret pact with josep-llus carod-rovira leader of esquerra republicana de catalunya erc republican left of catalonia. carod-rovira despite admitting to having met with eta in france in december denied having reached any accord saying that the meeting was an attempt to drive eta away from violence and ended with no results. this during an electoral campaign became a scandal and endangered the recent tripartite catalan government formed by erc erc iniciativa per catalunya verds-esquerra unida i alternativa icv-euia and the partit dels socialistes de catalunya psc. the opposition then accused aznar of being behind the leak to the media of the intelligence report detailing the meeting and aznar refused to clarify whether he knew about this meeting before the leaking. aznar was also questioned as to why the eta members who attended that meeting were not detained. also in  eta was initially suspected of being the authors of a series of ten bombings only a few days before the national elections which targeted three locations along madrid's suburban train lines on the morning of march   killing  civilians see  march  madrid attacks. this theory was officially endorsed by jos mara aznar's government despite the police quickly gathering evidence pointing towards islamic terrorism. many spanish citizens took this rush to judgment as an offence towards the victims of the attacks and towards the spanish people this was generally seen as a decisive factor in the electoral result which overturned aznar's government see spanish legislative election . the authorship of this attack the largest european terror incident in terms of lives lost since the  pan am flight  flight bombing has been finally ascribed to islamist terrorists by the spanish police. on september   eta militants sent a videotape to gara a basque newspaper based in guipuzcoa in which the militants stated that eta would continue to fight for basque self-determination and that eta would respond with arms at the ready to those who deny us through the force of arms. this videotape represented eta's first major public statement since the march  attacks. during the weekend preceding the videotape release the group claimed responsibility for a series of bombings that hampered electricity transmission between france and spain. october   french police launched an operation against eta's logisitical apparatus making  arrests among them the couple who functioned as top eta leaders mikel albizu iriarte mikel antza and soledad iparragirre anboto. they found four zulos caches with a vast quantity of armaments much greater than had been estimated to be at eta's disposal they also managed to turn up information about eta's printing an internal newsletter but nothing leading to any major bank account or other horde of money. the operation was considered one of the most successful since bidart in . as of of october  it appears that these measures will result in eta leadership moving into different hands it is too soon to evaluate the consequences. spain has solicited the extradition of mikel antza y amboto via a euroorden.  october  : eta is designated as a foreign terrorist organization fta by the u.s. government for the first time.  may  : thousands of spaniards participate in a silent march through san sebastian a

gathered in city and town halls around spain to silently protest two killings blamed on the basque separatist group eta. the cities include pamplona vitoria and zaragoza.  august  : the spanish police

 : u.s. treasury secretary paul o'neill announces that the u.s. has frozen assets of  people associated with eta.  december  : ibon fernandez iradi who is suspected of teaching eta members how to make

france.  december  : police in southwestern france arrest gorka palacios  the alleged military commander of eta. three people who the police said were collaborator were also arrested in the  am raid on a house in the village of lons near the town of pau. at a news conference in marrakesh morocco spanish interior minister angel acebes characterized the arrests as of great significance and of first magnitude.  february  : nine men and a woman are arrested making the number of eta suspects detained this week to . they worked on a basque-language newspaper euskaldunon egunkaria published

21	 eubulides of miletus was a ancient philosopher who formulated the liar paradox in the 4th century bc.
 he was the successor of eucleides of megara the founder of the megarian school of philosophy. besides paradoxes megarian logic focused on the logic of whole propositions in contrast to logic of predicates.
 another paradox attributed to eubulides is falakros or the bald man. a man with one hair is bald or two hairs but where do you draw the line as to how many hairs there can be before the man is not bald? this is the same as the paradox of the paradox.

21	like latin america some provinces of canada and some canadian politicians notably tommy douglas advocated eugenics as a method of reducing the burden of certain groups of individuals on socialized programs of government. the province of alberta for instance implemented a program of eugenics through forced sterilization of the mentally handicapped. tommy douglas an influential canadian politician used the principles embodied in eugenics as a convenient excuse to establish widespread socialized industries imposing a socialist ideology upon the province of saskatchewan the result of a steadfast belief that the citizenry were too stupid to help themselves. 
21	various authors notably stephen jay gould have repeatedly asserted that restrictions on immigration passed in the united states during the 1920s and overhauled in  were motivated by the goals of eugenics in particular a desire to exclude races considered to be inferior from the national gene pool. during the early 20th century the united states and canada began to receive far higher numbers of southern and eastern european immigrants. influential eugenicists like lothrop stoddard and harry laughlin who was appointed as an expert witness for the house committee on immigration and naturalization in  presented arguments that these were inferior races that would pollute the national gene pool if their numbers went unrestricted. it has been argued that this stirred both canada and the united states into passing laws creating a hierarchy of nationalities rating them from the most desirable and nordic peoples to the chinese and japanese immigrants who were almost completely banned from entering the country.see lombardo eugenics laws restricting immigration and stephen jay gould the mismeasure of man new york: norton . however several people in particular franz samelson mark snyderman and richard herrnstein have argued that based on their examination of the records of the congressional debates over immigration policy congress gave virtually no consideration to these factors. according to these authors the restrictions were motivated primarily by a desire to maintain the country's integrity against a heavy influx of foreigners.richard herrnstein and charles murray the bell curve free press :  and mark syderman richard herrnstein intelligence tests and the immigration act of  american psychologist  : . this interpretation is not however accepted by most historians of eugenics. some who disagree with the idea of eugenics in general contend that eugenics legislation still had benefits. margaret sanger founder of planned parenthood of america found it a useful tool to urge the legalization of contraception. in its time eugenics was seen by many as scientific and progressive the natural application of knowledge about breeding to the arena of human life. before the death camps of world war ii the idea that eugenics could lead to genocide was not taken seriously. in more recent times the combating autism act ratified unanimously by the united states senate and signed by president george w. bush is an example of modern eugenic legislation. the bill contains provisions to support the development of a prenatal diagnosis of autism which will likely be used for abortion to prevent autistics from existing. almost all non-catholic western nations adopted some eugenic legislations. in july  germany passed a law allowing for the involuntary sterilization of hereditary and incurable drunkards sexual criminals lunatics and those suffering from an incurable disease which would be passed on to their offspring.sterilisation of the unfit  nazi legislation the guardian  july . available online at two provinces in canada carried out thousands of compulsory sterilizations and these lasted into the 1970s. many first nations native canadians were targeted as well as immigrants from eastern europe as the program identified racial and ethnic minorities to be genetically . sweden forcibly sterilized  people primarily the mentally ill in the later decades but also ethnic or racial minorities early on as part of a eugenics program over a year period. as was the case in other programs ethnicity and race were believed to be connected to mental and physical health. while many swedes disliked the program politicians generally supported it the ruling left supported it more as a means of promoting social health while amongst the right it was more about racial protectionism. the swedish government has subsequently paid damages to those involved. besides the large-scale program in the united states other nations included australia the uk norway france finland denmark estonia iceland and switzerland with programs to sterilize people the government declared to be mentally deficient. singapore practiced a limited form of eugenics that involved encouraging marriage between university graduates and the rest through segregation in matchmaking agencies in the hope that the former would produce better children.there are a number of works discussing eugenics in various countries around the world. for the history of eugenics in scandinavia see gunnar broberg and nils roll-hansen eds. eugenics and the welfare state: sterilization policy in demark sweden norway and findland michigan state university press . another international approach is mark b. adams ed. the wellborn science: eugenics in germany france brazil and russia new york: oxford university press . in canada the eugenics movement took place early in the 20th century and largely in alberta. the focus of the motion was the sterilization of mentally deficient individuals as determined by the alberta eugenics board. the campaign to enforce this action was backed by groups such as the united farm women's group including key member emily murphy whose campaign for women's rights seemed to take a back seat in the matter. individuals were assessed using iq tests such as the stanford-binet. this posed a problem to many of the new immigrants arriving to canada as their lack of mastery with the english language often led to scores denoting them as having impaired intellectual functioning. as a result many of those sterilized under the canadian eugenics movement were immigrants who did not necessarily fall into the category. the height of the eugenics movement's popularity was reached during the depression. individuals sought a scapegoat for the financial problems of the nation and the notion of defective breeding brought about a means to place the blame on individuals considered to be subhuman. the end of the eugenics movement was brought about by the repealing of the law which made it mandatory in . in australia the policy of removing aboriginal children from their parents emerged from an opinion based on eugenics theory in late 19th

civilisation and that aborigines were inferior. according to this view the increasing numbers of mixed-descent children in australia labelled as half-castes or alternatively crossbreeds quadroons and octoroons were widely seen to be a threat to racial purity. in the first half of the twentieth century this led to policies and legislation that resulted in the removal of children from their aborigines act of  the stated aim was to cultural assimilate mixed descent people into contemporary australian society. in all states and territories legislation was passed in the early years of the twentieth century which gave aboriginal protectors guardianship rights over aborigines up to the age of sixteen or twenty-one. policemen or other agents of the state such as aboriginal protection officers were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their mothers or families or communities into institutions. in these australian states and territories

21	historically the term euthanasia has been distorted. the word euthanasia was used by nazi germany under the t euthanasia program. the purpose of the program was to both lower expenses by systematically killing the institutionalized as well as preserving the genetic quality of the german population by sterilizing people with physical deformities handicaps or mental illnesses. technically the t euthanasia program was actually a eugenics program and not euthanasia since euthanasia is defined as the merciful ending of a life for terminal or chronically painful conditions. the program was cancelled at least officially after public disapproval was expressed. this has tainted the word especially in german speaking countries especially as one of the main advocates of euthanasia in germany after world war ii was werner catel a leading nazi doctor directly involved in t. the currently accepted german term is the older literally helping to die which is used in contemporary german discussions. 
21	mercy killing is a term used for some cases of euthanasia. typically it refers to euthanasia by a non-doctor such as a parent who perceives the individual to be suffering. in some cases the individual cannot consent. in some cases the individual can consent but is not asked or refuses. lastly in some cases the individual consents and it may even be them who initiates the discussion. 
21	there are a number of conflicting beliefs about euthanasia. different aspects of euthanasia are supported by different people. some people argue against euthanasia based on the belief that only god should choose when someone dies. for the same reason the catholic church has long viewed suicide as a sin. some people approve of some forms of euthanasia in principle but fear a slippery slope that will result in support of other forms of euthanasia they are opposed to. with regards to nonvoluntary euthanasia the cases where the person could consent but wasn't asked are often viewed differently from those where the person could not consent. some people raise issues regarding stereotypes of disability that can lead to non-disabled or less disabled people overestimating the person's suffering or assuming it to be unchangeable when it could be changed. for example many disabled people responded to tracy latimer's death by pointing out that her parents had refused a hip surgery that could have greatly reduced or eliminated the physical pain tracy experienced. also they point out that a severely disabled person need not be in emotional pain at their situation and claim that the emotional pain if present is due to societal prejudice rather than the disability analogous to a black person wanting to die because they have internalized negative stereotypes about being black. with regards to voluntary euthanasia many people argue that equal access should apply to access to suicide as well so therefore disabled people who cannot kill themselves should have access to voluntary euthanasia. others respond to this argument by pointing out that if a nondisabled person attempts suicide all measures possible are taken to save their lives. suicidal people are often given involuntary medical treatment so that they will not die. this argument states that it is due to societal prejudice namely that disabled people are of lower worth and that any unhappiness must be due to the disability which results in greater support of voluntary euthanasia by disabled people than suicide by nondisabled people.

21	conformism is central to existentialism because man is inherently subjected to the influences of the culture that he inhabits. victor e. frankl explains this systemic problem most concisely in his novel mans search for meaning   at the beginning of human history man lost some of his basic animal instincts in which an animals behaviour is embedded and by which it is secured. such securities are closed to man forever  like paradise for he is required to make choices. in addition to this man has suffered another loss in his more recent development: the traditions that had buttressed his behaviour are now rapidly diminishing. no instinct tells man what to do and no tradition suggests what he ought to do soon he will not know what he wants to do! more and more he will be governed by what others want him to do thus falling prey to conformism

announced on october   by michael mayor and didier queloz the primary star was  pegasi. then dozens planets detected california berkeley. the majority of the detected planets have highly orbits. the first extrasolar planets were reported by aleksander in  orbiting the psr . subsequent investigation has determined that these objects not true planets in that they technically sub-brown dwarf masses an object that is or once was a star it is believed that they are the remnants of a supernova. there are main methods planets which too detected by conventional optical means. the first involves effect induced orbiting and moving it through mutual gravitation. the second involves catching the planet it passes the tiny which will cause the light to dip in distinctive way and do so periodically as planet completes multiple orbits. second method is theoretically more sensitive but is newer and has scored fewer successes. it also plane planet's orbit being aligned with the line sight between the and the earth. as a result any number of stars with planets that are not so aligned will be missed. most of the planets found are of relatively high mass at least  times that of earth however a couple seem to be approximately earth size. this reflects the current telescope technology which is not able to detect smaller planets. the mass distribution should not be taken as a reference for a general estimate since it is likely that many more planets with smaller mass even in nearby solar systems are still undetected. one question raised by detection extrasolar planets is why so many of the detected planets are gas giants which in comparison to earth's solar system are unexpectedly close to the orbited tau booumltis has a planet . times jupter mass which is less than one-quarter astronomical from orbited star  virginis has a planet . times jupiter's mass which is about one-half au from the orbited star and hd  has a planet  times jupiter's mass which is less than one-half au from the orbited star. possible answer to these unexpected planetary orbits is since astrometrics detects extrasolar planets due gravitational influences and partially-ecliptic interference perhaps current technology only permits detection of systems where a large planet is close to the orbited rather the alternative answer systems the norm. november the planet orbiting hd  from its absorption of light when passing in front of its star. also during that year a star was located which had the remnants of a planets within the stellar atmosphere apparently the planet was mostly vaporized. in  a group of polish astronomers prof. andrzej udalski prof. marcin kubiak dr michal szymanski from warsaw and polish-american prof. bogdan paczynski from princeton during project ogle the optical gravitational lensing experiment worked out a method of easily finding extrasolar planets based on a photometrical method. during one month claimed to find  objects many which could be planets. the kepler space mission will be launched next few years. it is a space-based designed specifically to search large numbers stars for earth-sized terrestrial planets. frequency of planets one of the parameters drake equation which attempts estimate the probability of communications extraterrestrial intelligence. following list of planets. note that the masses of the planets are lower bounds only. if a planet is detected by the spectral line displacement method referred to above no information is gained about the inclination the planet's plane orbit around its star and a value for this is needed to calculate the mass. it has become customary to arbitrarily assume that the plane is exactly lined up with the line of sight from earth this produces the lowest possible mass consistent with the spectral line measurements.  hd   . jupiter mass and . jupiter mass  hd   . jupiter mass.  hd   . jupiter mass  hd   . jupiter mass  hd   . jupiter mass  hd   . jupiter mass   pegasi  . jupiter

21	on aug.   i robin marks developed theory that a new type of volcanic eruption which is responsible for almost all extinction events. i called this event a mega hydrothermonuclear mass eruption. it is a super eruption which is complicated by the introduction of an enormous quanity of supercooled water in an inundation. it is a volcanic hotspot with a body of water above it. after a seismic episode introduces a fracture in the earth's crust the supercooled water enters the chamber where it is super-heated and vapourized instantly and the gas which is formed increases in volume bulging up against the earth's crust. as the pressure builds the fractures allows more water in. the rate of inundation increases exponentionally until there is a critical mass. the super charged hydrogen and oxygen molecules reach a flashpoint tempertature under massive pressure until they combust in a thermonuclear explosion. the magma is ejected into space and ignites the atmosphere. the cooling magma and gases would shroud the earth and bring about glaciation. the force of the eruption would increase the earth's rotation and change the earth's orbit. the debris orbitting the earth finally collected and formed the moon after a series of mega hydrothermonuclear mass eruption which began  million years ago and culminated in the extinctions of the dinosaurs. if such an explosion occurred on earth it would leave evidence. using simple geometry there is a series of three perfect circles in hudson bay. the centre of the circles aline perfectly with the direction of continential drift and when using the rate of drift if you move north america eastward past the mid atlantic ridge over top of the divide and move the continent at the same rate the centre of the largest circle aligns with the  mya million years ago extinction event. the second circle aligns with the end of the silurian  mya and the smallest but clearest circle  it sits just above james bay and is the most visible is  mya and starts the late devonian extinction events. the great lakes basins were formed at the end of this period. lake erie and lake ontario basins were formed approx  mya and the outflow became the st laweerence lowlands and flow out towards the atlantic.  mya an eruption occurred in the gulf of st lawerence and the circle or coldera can be seen around the gulf's edges and the island of prince eward island is cresent shaped and would be consistent with the inner ring of the caldera. the eruption which caused the kt extinction event and the demise of the dinosaurs occurred in the gulf of mexico and the circle has been torn in half as the continents drifted apart. i am developing more evidence and am trying to get independant verification of my math and findings. if you would like to collaborate my email is robinmyahoo.com ps the oxygen isotope ratio cycle also matches and the eruptions would explain acidification of bodies of water force organisism to develop air breathing lungs. the atmosphere would regain it's oxygen before the waters and the organisms would break the barriar looking for a better oxygen source. all the science fits.

 critical reaction to the film was mixed some hailing the film as another kubrick masterpiece but probably more critics and audiences regarding the film as pretentious tedious and meaningless tripe that was all technique and no soul.
 the film was based on the novel traumnovelle by austrian writer arthur schnitzler.

21	theme. a strange and mysterious  a clue to the meaning of the at once evocative and bewildering title of the movie can perhaps be found in an observation by religious scholar karen armstrong. in a history of god she points out that the word mystery derives from the greek word musteion: to close the eyes or the mouth. indeed an atmosphere of mystery and secrecy pervades the movie. the closing of eyes or hiding from unpleasant truths appears many times most especially with the blindfolding of nick the piano player in the orgy sequence and with the discrete eye closing and turning away of the orderly in the morgue where harford sees the corpse of the mysterious woman who may or may not have been at the orgy. 
21	orgy.  the movie abounds with references to greek mythology's conceptions of an underworld. in greek mythology pluto was the god of the underworld while plutus was the god of wealth. the contemporary word plutocrary or a ruling elite of the wealthy derives from the name plutus. historian will durant in his the life of greece suggested that the ancient greeks combined the gods of wealth and the underworld because they measured wealth in terms of corn. corn is rooted in the earth which they considered the domain of pluto. it is appropriate that harford's journey to the underworld and his experience of society's shadow takes place at an opulent mansion in the country side where a strange celebrates dark gods. harford's cab ride to the orgy suggests charon the boatman who ferried souls to the underworld. the story unfolds at christmas at the start of winter when pluto according to greek mythology ruled the world bringing cold weather and barren ground.

21	 an education voucher is a certificate by which parents are given the ability to pay for the education of their children at a school of their choice rather than the public school to which they were assigned.
 those in favor of school choice note that they should be permitted to spend their tax dollars at the educational facility of their choosing. detractors will state that such choice often results the selection of a religious school violating the separation of church and state.

21	studies in regard support the hypothesis of reduced racial and economic segregation through the abolishment of territorial-based school allocation in the monopoly system where students are assigned according to territorial thus dividing students between richer poorer neighboorhoods as well as greater free choice and quality improvement by forcing schools to compete among themselves by offering more diverse and interesting programs. schools. school choice also exists in the netherlands sweden spain the united kingdom poland and a few other countries generally supported by political parties from around the political spectrum except for communist parties and where notably introduced by the left notably in the netherlands sweden and the united kingdom. 
21	institute. however these studies should not be accepted because they are mostly based on the unchecked boasting of edison school corporation which has the following record in their schools: in sherman texas alone edison schools left a  million debt which had to be paid by the local public school district. although edison claimed that it boosted school test scores by  edison's president benno schmidt said that anyone who claims student improvement with less than  years experience is dishonest. he didn't realize that he was talking about his own company's sales material and according to sherman's superintendent of schools said edison kids fell behind other students in public schools. there are some private schools that do provide better education than public schools. unfortunately they are so pricey at phillips academy where george w. bush attended that even with the voucher the cost is prohibitive. for example a family in poverty according to the united states government has in income. let's say a family of four living on above the poverty line would get two vouchers . if that family of  decided to spend all of its income for a year no money for rent food health care or anything else just the education and used both vouchers for one child which is illegal they would still be  short per year. in other words there are two possible voucher plans. one would be only the rich would be able to afford it even with the vouchers but the children in designer blazers would get a better education the other would be everyone even the poor would be able to afford it but the students would get a worse education and local school boards would be saddled with enormous amounts of debt  million in  years. many people are now asking where the money for private school vouchers goes? according to no child left behind expert scott young  of the money handed out in the first pilot program went to children already in private schools. only  went to those not already enrolled in private schools those were in the lower-upper class and the upper-upper-middle class that didn't have just enough to pay on their own. obviously none of the kids that did move from public to private schools were the poor and minority children that the proponents of the coupon plan said would be helped were actually helped and schools. paragraph ref. greg palast armed madhouse pp.  this paragraph is under construction. 
21	school vouchers are seen by some as a way to meet the states obligation to support publicly funded school choice a basic human right. worldwide supporters of school choice have found support for their position in international human rights law which helps bring a broader understanding of the complex interrelated rights and liberties associated with education. freedom of expression religion freedom of association and security of the person are all correlated to any community based educational endeavor. school choice supporters have found support for their cause in the universal declaration of human rights. article . of the declaration states parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children. the term prior right has been interpreted as securing the right for parents to their choice or kind of education being publicly funded and not limiting public educational funding to only schools supported by the politically powerful. freedom of educational choice as articulated in article . can be understood as further supported for all parents in article  which assures the right to school choice to all regardless of social origin property or other status such as the ability to pay school tuition fees. educational choice may also be seen as supported in article  as an expression of liberty and security of the person and article  in regards to faith-based schools that are protected as an expression of religious freedom. most importantly as education and school communities are premised on social interaction and association between students parents teachers and administrators article . freedom of association can apply to protect students and parents from fiscally compelled association in any one kind of school community premised on school funding policies restricted to government favored groups be they commercial political union religious or other groups. freedom of association as it applies to educational endeavors is perceived as a critical social and legal counterbalance to state enforced elements of compulsory education. supporters of publicly funded school choice have used these articles to support their cause and have also used article  to point out that undermining support for publicly funded school choice may be a form of human rights abuse under the incitement clause as article  states all are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination. supporters of school choice have also found support for their cause in the convention against discrimination in education in particular article  which supports all kinds of education for all types of students including post secondary applications.
