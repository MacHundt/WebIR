36	 edgar allan poe january    
 born in boston massachusetts edgar allan poe was a 19th century poet novelist and short story writer whose curious and often nightmarish work has been highly influential in the genre fields of horror and fantasy. he worked as a literary critic and editor but was more successful as an author. he is also credited with having been the principal initiator of the genre of detective fiction with his three stories about edgar allan dupin the most famous of which is edgar allan murders in the rue murders in the rue morgue. poe's life was fraught with sorrow and he died in a pitiful state.

36	notice that the system will reach a point where the room the glass and the contents of the glass will be at the same temperature. in this situation nothing else can happen: although heat does exist in the room in fact the amount of heat is the same as in the beginning since it is a closed system it is now unable to do useful work as there are no more heat transfers. unless an external event intervenes thus breaking the definition of a closed system the room is destined to remain in the same condition for all eternity. therefore following the same reasoning but considering the whole universe as our room we reach a similar conclusion: that at a certain point in the distant future the whole universe will be a uniform isothemic and inert body of matter in which there will be no available energy to do work. this condition is known as the heat death of the universe. 
36	when an ideal gas suffer some kind of transformation its entropy may change. for some simple cases where specific heat and volume pressure or temperature is constant the change in entropy can be easily ant.htm ealgasesunderconstant.htm. when specific heat and volume are constant the change in entropy is given by: :mathdelta s  n cv ln fractt when specific heat and pressure are constant the change in entropy is given by: :mathdelta s  n cp ln fractt when specific heat and temperature are constant the change in entropy is given by: :mathdelta s  n r ln fracvv in these equations is the specific heat at constant volume is the specific heat at constant pressure and is the number of moles. for some other transformations not all of these properties specif heat volume pressure or temperature are constant. in these cases for only  mol of an ideal gas the change in entropy can be given :mathdelta s  cv ln fractt  r ln fracvv or :mathdelta s  cp ln fractt  r ln fracvv 
36	there are many thermodynamic properties that are functions of state. this means that at a particular state these properties have a certain value. often if two properties have a particular value then the state is determined and the other properties values are set. for instance an ideal gas at a particular temperature and pressure has a particular volume according to the ideal gas equation. that entropy is a function of state is what makes it very useful. as another instance a pure substance of single phase at a particular uniform temperature and pressure and thus a particular state is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy ja mcgovern in the carnot cycle the working fluid returns to the same state at particular part of the cycle hence the loop integral equaling zero.

36	 :this page is about the origins of the terms and concepts of evolution evolutionist and evolutionism as used by charles darwin and his contemporaries. for technical details of the origin of species see evolution for other meanings see evolution disambiguation.
 the words evolutionism and evolutionist has three related usages:
  originally the term meant the advocacy of the theories of social evolution.
  the term evolutionist may be one who studies evolutionary biology because of the ambiguation with a supporter of evolutionism most prefer the term evolutionary biologist.
  the advocacy of biological evolution as an explanation for the of life the word is particularly used by creationists.
 and cubs oil on canvas by jean-lon grome 
 charles darwin wrote his entire  first edition of origin of species without using the word evolution in it. the word evolution in popular use in  applied to a speculative explanation of how the world and life could be created from and the mere chemical properties of atoms without ever an intervention of a creation for example in  the month after darwin returned from collecting his specimens and data on the the the times summarized bucklands bridgewater treatise: geology and mineralogy considered with reference to natural theology and that  review already contained the creationist argument that evolution was wrong because all variety of animals were found in the same geological strata: the investigation of the newer transitionary strata assures us by their remains of the cotemporaneous existence of the four divisions of the animal kingdom vertebrata mollusca articulata and radiala--a fact which at once and for ever annihilates the doctrine of spontaneous and progressive evolution of life and its impious corollary chance. cordidffo--nov--f
 like spencer thomas huxley concerned himself with explaining how a world of sunlight seas rocks gases and trace minerals without a creator could generate the full span of life intelligence and civilization. and according to huxley he argued often with spencer about what mechanism could cause the transmutation from one type of animal to another but spencer could not provide a convincing mechanism. and in huxley's words even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. i took my stand upon two grounds: firstly that up to that time the evidence in favor of transmutation was wholly insufficient and secondly that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed which had been made was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena.
 according to huxley he could not believe the creationists because they had no convincing evidence. and by way of being perfectly fair i had exactly the same answer to give to the evolutionists of .
 but according to huxley darwin's  origin of species provided the first explanation that was better than creation. that which we were looking for and could not find was a hypothesis respecting the origin of known organic forms which assumed the operation of no causes but such as could be proved to be actually at work. we wanted not to pin our faith to that or any other speculation but to get hold of clear and definite conceptions which could be brought face to face with facts and have their validity tested. the origin provided us with the working hypothesis we sought.
 not surprisingly when huxley tried to explain darwin's working hypothesis to creationists he encountered interesting resistance to examining reality. one observer noted the following event where huxley in  attempted to get the audience to deal with the empirical data on origins.
 :i was happy enough to be present on the memorable occasion at oxford when mr huxley bearded bishop wilberforce. there were so many of us that were eager to hear that we had to adjourn to the great library of the museum. i can still hear the american accents of dr draper's opening address when he asked air we a fortuitous concourse of atoms? and his discourse i seem to remember somewhat dry. then the bishop rose and in a light scoffing tone florid and he assured us there was nothing in the idea of evolution rock-pigeons were what rock-pigeons had always been. then turning to his antagonist with a smiling insolence he begged to know was it through his grandfather or his grandmother that he claimed his descent from a monkey? on this mr huxley slowly and deliberately arose. a slight tall figure stern and pale very quiet and very grave he stood before us and spoke those tremendous words  words which no one seems sure of now nor i think could remember just after they were spoken for their meaning took away our breath though it left us in no doubt as to what it was. he was not ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth. no one doubted his meaning and the effect was tremendous. one lady fainted and had to carried out: i for one jumped out of my seat and when in the evening we met at dr daubeney's every one was eager to congratulate the hero of the day. i remember that some naive person wished it could come over again and mr huxley with the look on his face of the victor who feels the cost of victory put us aside saying once in a life-time is enough if not too much.
 there are also other versions of this same event from other observers who claimed to have been there.
 though darwin had excluded the word evolution from the first five editions of origin of species he imported both the term evolution and evolutionist into his sixth edition in  for example if numerous species belonging to the same genera or families have really started into life at once the fact would be fatal to the theory of evolution through natural selection.
 samplings of usages of the terms evolution evolutionist and evolutionism in darwin's time
 in  the london times published a review of darwin's book the expression of the emotions. darwin attributed much of the human emotional capability to an inheritance from the common ancestors of today's animals: a fierce sneer in which the upper lip is retracted and the canine tooth exposed on one side alone mr. darwin ventures to say reveals man's animal descent. the reviewer finds fault with the mechanical determinism in darwin's analysis that attributes too much to our early progenitors and not enough to the person's consciousness. then the reviewer says: his darwins thorough-going evolutionism tends to eliminate from the developed human form any relations beyond those of the bare mechanism of animal existence. ontentsetltrecordidffo--dec--f
 the word evolution was popularised during the 19th century by herbert spencer to mean cultural evolution i.e. the improvement of cultures see of the theory of cultural evolution mdash it was only later that it acquired its meaning. advocacy of such theory was called evolutionism.
 at the same time the word evolutionist was used to describe one who studies evolution most prefer to use the term evolutionary biologist instead because of how the word evolutionism is used by creationists see below.
 early history of evolutionism
 summary of the first chapter of robert carneiro's evolutionism in cultural anthropology: a critical history
  evolutionism in cultural anthropology: a critical history by robert carneiro isbn 
 the word is widely used by creationists and others who are opposed to the theory of evolution as an explanation for the of life to mean the proposition of such theory. they consider it to be a matter of religious faith in such explanations see ism.
 the scientific community however rarely uses the word. in america the national center for science education an organisation which opposes creationism does not use the term but does use related term anti evolutionism meaning the opposition to the evolutionary theory.
 in addition young earth earth creationists may use the term evolutionism to include the paradigms of other sciences such as geology and astronomy which have been used to estimate the age of the earth and age of the universe respectively.
 opponents of evolutionary theory may also equate the word with other belief systems that they are opposed to such as atheism agnosticism secular humanism and rationalism and things they identify with that such as materialism. they may further try to equate with extremist political ideologies such as fascism because of its harsh economics because of the communist association with atheism. eugenics generally discredited is also mentioned mdash the bastardization evil-utionism is a useful of their point of view
 in  john peloza an united high school teacher sued his school board claiming that he was being forced to teach the religion of evolutionism. the united states court of appeal ninth circuit found against peloza. the court found that peloza's arguments were inconsistent. on that appeal the decision to make peloza pay the costs of the high school board was reversed because it was an important test case balancing free speech against the establishment clause.
 philosopher of science michael ruse has more recently come to the conclusion that evolution is ultimately based on several unproven philosophical assumptions.
 in computer science a genetic algorithm is an algorithm used to find approximate solutions to difficult-to-solve problems through application of the principles of evolutionary biology to computer science. genetic algorithms use biologically-derived techniques such as inheritance mutation genetic natural selection and recombination genetic genetic algorithms are a particular class of evolutionary algorithms. !- just a slightly modified first paragraph from genetic algorithm article for a good start -
 the pioneering founder of much of todayrsquos work in genetic algorithms was john holland. genetic algorithms has moved on from a purely theoretical subject though based on computer modelling to provide methods which can be used to actually solve some difficult problems today.
