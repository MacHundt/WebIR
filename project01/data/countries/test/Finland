23	christos. religion the spelling christ in english dates from the 17th century when in the spirit of the enlightenment spellings of certain words were changed to fit their greek or latin origins. prior to this in old english and middle english the word was spelt crist the i being pronounced either as a long e preserved in the names of churches such as st katherine cree or as a short i preserved in the modern pronunciation of christmas. the term appears in english and most european languages owing to the greek usage of it in the new testament as a description for jesus. in the septuagint version of the old testament it was used to translate into greek the hebrew mashiach messiah meaning one who is anointed. while many christian writers claim that this term implied a match to the criteria of being anointed that jewish tradition had given to their predicted future saviour some argue that there is no saviour concept as suggested in christianity in the jewish tradition. the anointed one more closely means high priest leader or even ruler. the greek term is cognate with chrism meaning perfumed oil in fact christ in classical greek usage could mean covered in oil and is thus a literal and accurate translation of messiah. the greek term is thought to derive from the proto-indo-european root of ghrei which in germanic languages such as english mutated into gris and grim-. hence the english words grisly grim grime and grease are thought to be cognate with christ though these terms came to have a negative connotation where the greek word had a positive connotation. in french the greek term in ordinary usage mutated first to cresme and then to creme due to use of the circumflex in loss of certain s usages in french which loan loaned into english as cream. the word was used by extension in hellenic and jewish contexts to refer to the office role or status of the person not to their actually having oil on their body as a strict reading of the etymology might imply. according to tom harpur a former professor of theology at the university of toronto and one of the few people to have been accorded the prestigious rhodes scholarship the christian usage of the term christ derives from egypt. harpur has argued that the application of the term christ to jesus derives from the egyptian use of the term karast covered in embalming oil to describe horus who harpur also alleges that much of the descriptions of jesus are copied from. karast is a false cognate to christ and harpur has alleged that this co-incidence was the reason that christians chose this appelation of horus rather than any other since in jewish circles christ readily brings to mind the jewish belief in a messiah. anointing in the bible in the hebrew faith tradition with holy anointing was a key element of religious ceremony by which specific people were explicitly marked or set aside for a specific role: priests and prophets. in some cases other materials were anointed with oil as well to prepare them for religious ceremony. the importance of anointing is sometimes stressed by mentioning the need for it alongside reference to the person in question: e.g. the priest that is anointed shall carry of the blood into the tabernacle of the testimony :. many writers feel that some jews came to expect a leader who would embody the elements of priest king and prophet and whom they therefore termed the messias which served as a title. the association with being anointed and being a leader makes these words in some senses equivalent. they expressed their hopes for this leader particularly in their prayers known as the psalms which often make reference to god and his anointed many of which references some christians interpret as prophetic.  anointing in the new testament and subsequent rites  anointing is used in the new testament to heal the sick to bless for ministry to give thanks to jesus and to prepare for burial. according to eastern orthodox and roman catholic traditions as christ was the anointed one so is apostolic succession manifest in those priests who carry on the ministry of christ premised upon an anointing. oil is used in a number of the sacraments of these traditions. practices vary slightly from east to west. every christian in the roman and eastern orthodox churches is anointed with oil at least once if he or she receives the sacraments according to each organization's plan. protestant organizations rites however do not always include anointing with oil. see jesus and new testament view on jesus life. in the new testament it says that a savior long awaited had come and shall second and that this savior is christ.  distinctions between jesus christ and god  the term christ is often used synonymously with jesus. a difference in usage is sometimes for variety of speech and sometimes a subtlety intended to emphasize the totality of his person and function in salvationchristian views of for example ott refers to jesus when emphasizing an event in the new testament while he refers to christ in discussing the nature of god. there is a temporal distinction between jesus and god. god in the christian belief system exists outside of the time continuum and is not restricted by the confines of time e.g. limitations aging development evolution etc.. jesus on the other hand is the temporal incarnation of the logos ampmdash the divine word of god ampmdash as described in the first chapter of the gospel of john jesus was born lived suffered died and resurrected. most christians believe that there is no distinction between god and jesus holding that jesus is the second person of the holy trinity and that jesus did not lose divinity in the incarnation but rather took on humanity. they likewise believe that jesus is the christ. the term christ pertains to the role to be performed by the chosen one of god another possible translation of christ. the problem with this word for the person of jesus is that the term means different things to different people. most especially the term messiah refers often in jewish beliefs of the roman era to the hoped-for leader who would not only be a spiritual leader but a political one as well. hence we have grounds for why this term might cause consternation and skepticism  if not downright hostility  not only for romans but also for the jewish leadership of the temple at the time of jesus. those who are not christian and who do not believe jesus of nazareth is the christ are still awaiting the arrival of the christ the annointed one. the generally believed not in a jesus who was both a divine person and a human person but in a spiritual christ who indwelt jesus. through the spiritual path of gnosticism followers of these schools believed that they could experience the same knowledge or gnosislt!- suggestion: don't disambiguate gnosis -gt. their theology was or is and premised upon demigods salvation for the elect and the actions of god who sends periodic saviors. this was considered heresy by the early church as per the first ecumenical council which occurred at nicaea in  ad although condemnation of the belief existed well before. in the western esoteric tradition and later rosicrucian there is a distinction to be made between jesus and the christ ltrefgt max heindel the rosicrucian cosmo-conception part iii chapter xv: christ and his mission november  isbn jesus is considered a high initiate of the human life wave which evolves under the cycle of and of a singularly pure type of mind vastly superior to the great majority of the present humanity. he was educated during his youth among the essenes and thus prepared himself for the greatest honor ever bestowed upon a human being: to deliver his pure passionless highly evolved physical body and etheric body already attuned to the high vibrations of the life spirit in the moment of the baptism of to the christ being for his ministry in the physical world. christ is described as the highest spiritual being of the life wave called archangels and has completed his union the son with the second aspect of the rosicrucian cosmo-conceptionthe rosicrucian conception of god and the scheme of see also second comingesoteric christian coming of the christ according to the esoteric christian tradition. christ has taken on such power and significance as a theological religious and devotional term that it has been appropriated and expanded by various theologians and religious writers so as to take it beyond the christian context in which christ refers strictly to jesus as the second member of the trinity. one belief is the idea or concept that jesus became christ i.e. his flesh was transformed to spirit. by taking a spiritual and good path through life jesus was reunited with his true holy nature redemption and preserved forever in god. in this view this psychic force is often called the christ or sometimes christ consciousness drawing a separation between god whose nature some maintain we cannot fathom or comprehend and the holy spirit which can be experienced through jesus and is therefore compatibility with our mortal and frail humanity. matthew fox sometimes speaks of the cosmic christ. in eastern religious traditions god is often described by both personifications deities which are manifestations of particular aspects of god's power and incarnations avatars of god in mortal form as in case of krishna. in these religions the christ is akin to these personifications. a.c bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada who coined the phrase krishna consciousness held jesus teachings as non-different from the hindu vedic scriptures and others such as paramahansa yogananda often wrote about a christ consciousness interchangeably with krishna consciousness. the interjection christ! is often used as a sign of surprise or anger without a direct religious reference  that is as a word. devout christians find this usage blasphemous as they feel it cheapens god's holy name and violates the mosaic ten against taking his name in vain. interestingly there is a phrase in usage commonly in america: for crying out loud! this is actually a euphemism for oh for christ's sake! used as an alternative people reluctant to swear using actual name. christ is also the name of a british humour
