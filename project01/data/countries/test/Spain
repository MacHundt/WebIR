3	according to a bbc report on the saville inquiry findings relating to the key soldiers involved with bloody sunday it states that lt. col. wilford was directly in charge of the soldiers who went into the bogside to arrest rioters protect the public and return back to base unharmed. however wilford disobeyed his orders by his superior brigadier patrick maclellan. in contrast major ted loden was the commander in charge of soldiers following orders issued by lieutenant colonel wilford. furthermore following the events of bloody sunday wilford was the awarded the order of the british empire by the queen. see here bloody sunday: key soldiers involved bbc news 
3	 removal of vital information on bloody sunday  some guy named the banner who seems to be dutch keeps removing information to bloody sunday. although the banner may not like the information or it conflicts with what you think you know the information i had written is reliable and has valid citations. please stop. in the first instance there would be no in-depth mention of all the key figures from the british army in this article and therefore misinform a reader. for instance the article argues loden was in charge on the day when in fact it was wilford which is covered in the paragraph i had written before the banner removed it. see as follows: regarding the soldiers in charge on the day of bloody sunday saville found: lieutenant colonel derek wilford was commander of  para and on the day was directly responsible to arrest rioters and return to base. however wilford deliberately disobeyed his superior brigadier patrick maclellan's orders by sending support company into the bogside and without informing maclellan. brigadier patrick maclellan was operational commander of the day. the saville inquiry cleared maclellan of any wrong-doing as he was under the impression that wilford would follow orders by arresting rioters and then returning to base and could not be blamed for for wilford's actions.major general robert ford was commander of land forces and set the british strategy to oversee the civil march in derry. although saville cleared ford of any fault he found ford's selection of  para and in particular wilford to be in control of arresting rioters was disconcerning specifically as  para was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the army and nationalists.major ted loden was the commander in charge of soldiers following orders issued by lieutenant colonel wilford. saville cleared loden of misconduct citing that loden neither realised nor should have realised that his soldiers were or might be firing at people who were not posing or about to pose a threat. in short the inquiry found that loden could not be held responsible for claims whether malicious or not by some of the individual soldier's of receiving fire from snipers. captain mike jackson later general sir mike jackson was second in command of  para on the day of bloody sunday. saville cleared jackson of sinsiter actions following jackson's compiling of a list of what soldiers told major loden on why they had fired. this list became known as loden list of engagements which played a role in the army's initial explanations. while saville found the compiling of the list was far from ideal he accepted jackson's explanations based on the list not containing the name of soldiers and the number times they fired. saville had concluded that lance corperal f was responsible for a number of the deaths and that a number of soldiers have knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing. intelligence officer colonel maurice tugwell and colin wallace an ipu army press officer were also both cleared of wrongdoing. saville believed the information tugwell and wallace released through the meadia was not down to any deliberate attempt to deceive the public but rather due to much of the inaccurate information tugwell had received at the time by various other figures. major michael steele who with maclellan in the operational room and who was in charge of passing on the orders on the day. saville accepted steele could not believe other that a separation had been achieved between rioters and marchers because both groups were in different areas. secondly there is no mention of what happened to these key figures after bloody sunday in the article. i had written the following: nonetheless six months after bloody sunday lieutenant colonel derek wilford who was directly in charge of  para the soldiers who went into the bogside was awarded the order of the british empire by the queen while other soldiers were equally decorated with honors for their part on the day i think this is valuable information because the true extent of injustice the people of derry experienced but the banner clearly does not think so and had removed it. thirdly removed by the banner was the reaction by wilford on blairs intention to run the saville inquiry although he mentions a comments by certain members of the british army that may give the wrong impression they wanted this. in fact they didn't as indicated by wilford below: in  lieutenant colonel derek wilford expressed his anger at tony blair's intention of setting up the saville inquiry citing he was proud of his actions on bloody sunday.two years later in  during an interview with the bbc wilford said there might have been things wrong in the sense that some innocent people people who were not carrying a weapon were wounded or even killed. but that was not done as a deliberate malicious act. it was done as an act of war. finally and most importantly the banner removes the comments of cameron in the houses of commons which i had written as: reporting the findings of the saville inquiry in the house of commons the british prime minister david cameron said: mr speaker i am deeply patriotic. i never want to believe anything bad about our country. i never want to call into question the behaviour of our soldiers and our army who i believe to be the finest in the world. and i have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve. but the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear. there is no doubt there is nothing equivocal there are no ambiguities. what happened on bloody sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. it was wrong. omitting this comment is silly beacuse this comment is iconic of when the british government accepted they were wrong on bloody sunday and needs to be kept in. it is what many people had sought for a long time and it is disrespectful to not include it. all that has been written here can be backed up from here: they are mostly bbc bloody sunday: key soldiers involved bbc news britain's propaganda war during the troubles bbc news major gives bloody sunday evidence bbc news bloody sunday: pm david cameron's full statement bbc news col wilford: don't blame my soldiers bbc news bloody sunday inquiry 
3	to create a seperate article just to write one line of awards given for bloody sunday would be silly lt alone misdirection. by keeping this information in this article not only reports factual information but also keeps the article neutral. it portrays the true sentiment of what was occurring at the time. i mean how would this information not be keeping the article neutral. for instance take the following paragraph which is already in this article and was not placed there by meand tell me how exactly it is more neutral than six months after bloody sunday the queen decorated a number of service men which i had added: following the events of bloody sunday bernadette devlin an independent socialist nationalist mp from northern ireland expressed anger at what she perceived as government attempts to stifle accounts being reported about the day. having witnessed the events firsthand she was later infuriated that she was consistently denied the chance to speak in parliament about the day although parliamentary convention decreed that any mp witnessing an incident under discussion would be granted an opportunity to speak about it in the house. devlin punched reginald maudling the secretary of state for the home department in the conservative government when he made a statement to parliament on the events of bloody sunday stating that the british army had fired only in self-defence the fact is these decorations by the queen to british soldiers occurred as a direct result of bloody sunday and therefore merit mentioning as wikipedia aspires to show factual information.
