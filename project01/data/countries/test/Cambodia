has to flee into midianmidian: the desert region between egypt and the negev. to escape pharaoh's anger. while herding the flocks of his father-in-law jethromoses father-in-law is named reuel and jethro in the torah and hobeb in judges. hobeb also appears in the torah in numbers but is identified there as son of reuel. on mount horebhoreb: an alternative name for mount sinai. moses encounters god who reveals his name yahweh and tells him to return to egypt and lead israelites into the land abraham. on moses'return yahweh reveals name and instructs him to appear before pharoah and inform him of yahweh's demand that he let god's people go. moses and aaron do so but pharoah refuses. yahweh sends a series of plagues but pharoah does not relent. yahweh instructs moses to institute the passover sacrifice among the israelites and then kills all the firstborn children of the egyptians. pharoah agrees to let the israelites go. moses explains the meaning of the passover: it is for israel's salvation from the israelites will not be required to sacrifice their own sons but to redeem them. journey through the wilderness to sinai the exodus begins. the israelites  men plus women and children and  mixed multitudewith their flocks and herds set out mountain god.mountain of god: this phrase is sometimes used for the holy mountain other times it is or sinai. yahweh demonstrate makes pursue crossing destroys pharaoh's army in sea. celebrate deliverance with sea. but they immediately begin to complain of the hardships. food and speak with longing of egypt and yahweh to eat. he provides the meribah. attack yahweh them. jethrojethro is here described as priest midian. and exclaims that yahweh is greater than all the gods because he has delivered israel from egypt at jethro's suggestion moses appoints over israel. at sinai: yahweh asks whether will agree to be his people and people accept. on the appointed day the people gather at the foot of sinai fire and trumpets and the trembling of the mountain the mountain. the people see the cloud hear the voice but moses and aaron are told ascend the mountain.it is not clear exactly what voice means  exodus : says moses would speak and god would answer in voice implying intelligible words but the implication the following verses in exodus : is that the hear only thunder and trumpets: and the people saw the thunder and the lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and they said to moses you speak with us so we may listen but let not speak with us or we will die. it is also not totally clear who goes up the mountain  exodus : has yahweh instructing moses and aaron to up while the people and priests remain below but at exodus : the priests seem to be told they may approach yahweh after consecrating themselves. but before they do god pronounces the ten commandments in the hearing of all israel.a slightly different version is given at deuteronomy  the most striking difference being in the reason given for keeping the sabbath: in exodus the sabbath is kept because god made the heavens and earth in seven days in deuteronomy it is memorial for israel's deliverance from egypt. moses goes up the mountain into the presence of god who pronounces the covenant codeexodus:-: a detailed of obey.exodus  moses descends and writes down yahweh's words and the people agree to keep them. yahweh the mountain together with aaron and the elders of israel and they feast in the presence of yahweh. yahweh calls moses up he and joshua go up leaving aaron in charge. yahweh appears on the mountain like consuming fire and calls moses to go up and moses goes up the mountain.this passage has confusing sequence of events but the summary is roughly accurate. priestly vestments include: worship. he threatens kill them all moses tablets. yahweh commands moses words that were on the first tablets. moses ascends the mountain and dictates the ritual commandmentsthe unlike the ethical decalogue is explicitly called  see exodus : and writes them on the tablets.at exodus : god has told moses that he god will personally write on the tablets but at exodus : he tells moses write them. also although god tells moses that he is about to receive a copy of the first set of tablets exodus : makes clear that the first tablets contained the instructions for the tabernacle while exodus : makes it equally clear that the second set contain the ritual decalogue. moses descends from the mountain and face is transformed so that from that time onwards he has to hide face with a veil. moses assembles the israelites repeats to them the commandments he has received from yahweh to keep the sabbath and to construct the tabernacle. and all the construction of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished and the children of israel did according to everything that yahweh had commanded mosesreexodus : and yahweh dwelt in the tabernacle and ordered the travels of the israelites.this is a broad summary of the final verses :-
