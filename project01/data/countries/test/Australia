nationalism and anti-communism. with the establishment of a nazi germanyeconomic economy of a rearmed and a and regime hitler pursued aggressive foreign relations policy with intention of german

was battle of overrun by the red army. hitler as an infant. adolf hitler  at braunau am inn austria a small town in upper austria the border with germany. he was the third son and the fourth of six children of alois hitler born schicklgruber ampndash a minor customs official and klara plzl ampndash his second cousin and third wife. because of the close kinship of the two a papal dispensation had to be obtained before the marriage could take place. of alois and klara's six children only adolf and his younger sister paula reached adulthood. alois hitler also had a son alois hitler jr. and a daughter angela by his second wife. alois was born illegitimate and for the first thirty-nine years of his life bore his mother's name schicklgruber. in  alois began using the name of his stepfather johann georg hiedler after visiting a priest responsible for births deaths and marriages registries and declaring that georg was his father alois gave the impression that georg was still alive but he was long dead. the name was variously spelled hiedler huetler huettler and hitler and probably changed to hitler by a clerk. the origin of the name is considered to be either from the german word hittler and similar one who lives in a hut shepherd or from the slavic word hidlar and hidlarcek. later adolf hitler was accused by his political enemies of not rightfully being a hitler but a schicklgruber. this was also exploited in allied propaganda during world war ii when pamphlets bearing the phrase heil schicklgruber were airdropped over german cities.fact adolf was legally born a hitler however and was also closely related to hiedler through his maternal grandmother johanna hiedler. hitler's given name adolf comes from the old high german for noble wolf adelnobility  origin and popularity of the name adolph hence not surprisingly one of hitler's self-given nicknames was wolf or herr wolf  he began using this nickname in the early 1920s and was addressed by it only by intimates as uncle wolf by the wagners up until the fall of the third reich.ltrefgtwalter c. langer ltcitegtthe mind of adolf p.  basic books: new york by his closest family and relatives hitler was known simply as adi. the names of his various headquarters scattered throughout continental europe wolfsschanze in prussia wolfsschlucht france werwolf in ukraine etc. seem to reflect this. as a boy hitler was whipped almost daily by his father. years later he told his secretary i then resolved never again to cry when my father whipped me. a few days later i had the opportunity of putting my will to the test. my mother frightened took refuge in the front of the door. as for me i counted silently the blows of the stick which lashed my rear end. ltrefgtjohn toland adolph hitler pp. hitler was not sure who his paternal grandfather was but it was probably either johann georg hiedler or his brother johann nepomuk hiedler. there have been rumours that hitler was one-quarter jewish and that his paternal grandmother maria schicklgruber had become pregnant after working as a servant in a jewish household in graz during the 1920s, the implications of these rumours along with his known family history were politically explosive especially for the proponent of a ideology. opponents tried to prove that hitler the leader of the anti semitic nazi party had jewish or czech ancestors. although these rumours were never confirmed for hitler they were reason enough to conceal his origins. soviet propaganda insisted hitler was a jew though more modern research tends to diminish the probability that he had jewish ancestors. according to robert g. l. waite in the psychopathic god: adolf hitler hitler made it illegal for german women to work in jewish households and after the anschluss annexation of austria hitler had his father's hometown obliterated by turning it into an artillery practice area. hitler seemed to fear that he was jewish and as waite points out this fact is more important than whether he actually was. because of alois hitler's profession his family moved frequently from braunau am to passau lambach leonding and linz. as a young child hitler was reportedly a good student at the various elementary schools he attended however in sixth grade ampndash his first year of high school realschule in linz he failed completely and had to repeat the grade. his teachers reported that he had no desire to work. one of hitler's classmates in the linz realschule was ludwig wittgenstein who went on to become one of the great philosophers of the 20th century.ltrefgtalthough hitler and wittgenstein did attend the same school there is scant evidence that they actually knew each other or had any meaningful contact. the fact remains nothing more than an interesting bit of trivia despite a recent book by british author kimberley cornish which suggests that conflict between the young hitler and a group of jewish students that included wittgenstein was a critical moment in hitler's formation as an anti-semitic radical. see the jew of linz: hitler wittgenstein and their secret battle for the mind . hitler later explained this educational slump as a kind of rebellion against his father alois who wanted the boy to follow him in a career as a customs official although adolf wanted to become a painter. this explanation is further supported by hitler's later description of himself as a misunderstood artist. however after alois died on january   when adolf was  hitler's schoolwork did not improve. at the age of  hitler left school with no professional early adulthood in vienna and munich from  onward hitler was able to live the life of a on a fatherless child's pension and support from his mother. he was rejected twice by the academy of fine arts vienna  ampndash  due to unfitness for painting and was told his abilities lay rather in the field of architecture. his memoirs reflect a fascination with the subject: ltblockquotegtthe purpose of my trip was to study the picture gallery in the court museum but i had eyes for scarcely anything but the museum itself. from morning until late at night i ran from one object of interest to another but it was always the buildings which held my primary interest. mein kampf chapter ii paragraph following the school rector's recommendation he too became convinced this was the path to pursue yet he lacked the proper academic preparation for architecture school: ltblockquotegtin a few days i myself knew that i should some day become an architect. to be sure it was an incredibly hard road for the studies i had neglected out of spite at the realschule were sorely needed. one could not attend the academy's architectural school without having attended the building school at the technic and the latter required a high-school degree. i had none of all this. the fulfillment of my artistic dream seemed physically impossible.mein kampf chapter ii paragraph  amp on december   his mother klara died a painful death from breast cancer at the age of . hitler gave his share of the orphans benefits to his younger sister paula but when he was  he inherited some money from an aunt. he worked as a struggling painter in vienna copying scenes from postcards and selling his paintings to merchants and tourists there is evidence he produced over  paintings and drawings world war i. watercolour by adolf hitler depicting laon france. after the second refusal from the academy of arts hitler gradually ran out of money. by  sought refuge in a homeless shelter and by beginning of had settled permanently into a house for poor working men. hitler first became an active anti-semite in vienna which had a large jewish community including many orthodox jews from eastern europe and where traditional religious prejudice mixed recent racist theories. hitler was influenced over time by the writings the race ideologist and anti-semite lanz von liebenfels and polemics from politicians karl lueger founder of the christian social party list of mayors of of vienna one of the most outrageous demagogues in history and georg ritter von schnerer leader of the pan-germanic away from rome! movement. he later wrote in book mein kampf that his transition from opposing anti-semitism on religious grounds to supporting it on racial grounds came from having seen orthodox jew: ltblockquotegtthere were very few jews in linz. in the course of centuries the jews who lived there become external appearance so much like other human beings that i even looked upon them germans. the reason why then perceive the absurdity of such an illusion was that the only external mark which i recognized distinguishing them from us was the practice of their strange religion. as that they were persecuted on account of their faith my aversion to hearing remarks against them grew almost into a feeling of abhorrence. did not in the least suspect that there could be such thing as systematic anti-semitism. ltblockquotegtonce when passing through the inner city suddenly encountered phenomenon in a long caftan and wearing black side-locks. my first thought was: is this a jew? they certainly did not have this appearance in linz. carefully watched the man stealthily and cautiously but the longer i gazed at the strange countenance and examined it feature by feature the more the question shaped itself in my brain: is this a german? ltbrgtmein kampf vol.  chap. : years of study and suffering in vienna hitler began to claim the jews were natural enemies of what he called the aryan race. he held them responsible for austria's crisis. he also identified certain forms of socialism and especially which had many jews among its leaders as jewish movements merging his anti-semitism with anti-marxism. blaming germany's military defeat on the  revolutionsfact he considered jews the culprit of imperial germany's military defeat and subsequent economic problems as well. generalising from tumultuous scenes in the parliament of the multi-national monarchy he developed a firm belief in the inferiority of the democratic parliamentary system which formed the basis of his political views. however according august kubizek his close friend and roommate at the time he was more interested in the operas of richard wagner than in politics. image:hitlers paintings  landscape painted by adolf hitler. hitler received the final part of his father's estate in may  and moved to munich. he later wrote in mein kampf that he had always longed to live in a real german city. in munich he became more interested in architecture and the writings of houston stewart chamberlain. moving to munich also helped him escape service in austria for a time but the austrian army later arrested him. after a physical exam during which his height was measured at  cm  ft  in and a contrite plea he was deemed unfit for service and allowed to return to munich. however when germany entered world war i in august  he immediately petitioned king ludwig iii of bavaria for permission to serve in a bavarian regiment this request was granted and adolf hitler enlisted in the bavarian army.ltrefgtshirer william l. the rise and fall of adolf hitler c  random hitler saw active service in france and belgium as a messenger for the regimental headquarters of the 16th bavarian reserve regiment also called regiment list after its first commander which exposed him to enemy fire. unlike his fellow soldiers hitler reportedly never complained about the food or hard conditions preferring to talk about art or history. he also drew some cartoons and instructional drawings for the army newspaper. his behaviour as a soldier was considered somewhat sloppyfact his regular duties required taking dispatches from fighting areas and was twice decorated for his performance of these duties. he received the iron cross second class in december  and the iron cross first class in august  an honour rarely given to a gefreiter. however because of the perception of a lack of leadership skills the part some of the regimental staff according to kershaw hitler's unwillingness to leave regimental headquarters which would have been likely in event of promotion he was never promoted to unteroffizier. other historians however say that the reason he was not promoted is that he did not have german citizenship. his

volume  chapter  years of study and suffering in vienna hitler had long admired germany and during the war he had become a passionate german although he did not become a german citizen until . he was shocked by germany's capitulation in november  even while the german army still held enemy territory. like many other german hitler believed in the dolchstolegende dagger-stab legend which claimed that the army undefeated in the field had been stabbed in the back by civilian leaders and marxists back on the home front. these politicians were later dubbed the november criminals. the treaty of versailles deprived germany of various territories the rhineland and imposed other economically damaging sanctions. the treaty also declared germany the culprit for all the horrors of the great war as a basis for later imposing not-yet specified reparations on germany the amount was repeatedly revised under the dawes plan the young plan and the hoover moratorium. germans however perceived the treaty and especially the paragraph on the german guilt as a humiliation not least as it was damaging in the extreme to their pride. for example there was a nearly total demilitarisation of the armed forces allowing germany only  battleships no submarines no air force an army  without conscription and no armoured vehicles. the treaty was an important factor in both the social and political conditions encountered by hitler and his national socialist party as they sought power. hitler and his party used the signing of the treaty by the november criminals as a reason to build up germany so could never happen again. he also used the november criminals as scapegoats although at the paris peace conference these politicians had had very little choice in the matter. the early years of the nazi party copy of adolf hitler's forged german workers membership card. his actual membership number was  the 55th member of the party  the  was added to make the group appear larger but later the

to infiltrate an existing one instead. hitlers entry into politics after world war i hitler remained in the army and returned to munich where he  in contrast to his later declarations  participated in the funeral march for the murdered bavarian prime minister kurt  picture of after the suppression of the bavarian soviet republic he took part in national thinking courses organized by the education and propaganda department dept of the bavarian reichswehr group headquarters  under captain karl mayr. a key purpose of this group was to create a scapegoatpolitical.fsociological for the outbreak of the war and germany's defeat. the scapegoats were found in international jewry communists and politicians across the party spectrum especially the parties of the weimar coalition who were deemed

reich london: weidenfeld amp nicolson  url accessed june  eckart became hitler's mentor exchanging ideas with him teaching him how to dress and speak and introducing him to a wide range of people. hitler in return thanked eckart by paying tribute to him in the second volume of mein kampf. hitler was discharged from the army in march  and with his former superiors continued encouragement began participating full time in the party's activities. by early  adolf hitler was becoming highly effective at speaking in front of even larger crowds. in february hitler spoke before a crowd of nearly six thousand in munich. to publicize the meeting he sent out two truckloads of party supporters to drive around with swastikas cause a commotion and throw out leaflets their first use of this tactic. hitler gained notoriety outside of the party for his rowdy polemic speeches against the treaty of versailles rival politicians including monarchists nationalists and other non-internationalist socialists and especially against marxists and jews. the dap was centered in munich which had become a hotbed of german nationalists who included army officers determined to crush marxism and undermine or even overthrow the young german republic. gradually they noticed adolf hitler and his growing movement as a vehicle to hitch themselves to. hitler traveled to berlin to visit nationalist groups during the summer of  and in his absence there was an unexpected revolt among the dap leadership in munich. the party was run by an executive committee whose original members considered hitler be overbearing and even dictatorial. to weaken hitler's position they formed an with a group of socialists from augsburg. hitler rushed back to munich and countered them by tendering resignation from the party on july  . when they realized the loss of hitler would effectively mean the end of the party he seized the moment and announced he would return on the condition that he was chairman and given dictatorial powers. infuriated committee members including founder anton drexler held out at first. meanwhile an anonymous pamphlet appeared entitled adolf hitler: is he a traitor? attacking hitler's lust for power and criticizing the violence-prone men around him. hitler responded to its publication a munich newspaper by for slander and and later won a small settlement. the executive committee of the dap eventually backed down and hitler's demands put to a vote of party members. hitler received votes for only one against. at the next gathering on july   adolf hitler was introduced as fhrer of the national socialist party marking the first time this title was publicly used. hitler changed name the party to the national socialist german party nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei or national socialist german workers hitler's beer hall oratory attacking jews social democrats reactionary began attracting adherents. early followers included rudolf hess former air force pilot hermann gring and army captain ernst rhm who became head the nazis paramilitary organization the which protected meetings and attacked political opponents. hitler also assimilated independent groups the nuremberg based deutsche werkgemeinschaft led by julius streicher who now became gauleiter of franconia. hitler also attracted the attention of local business interests was accepted into influential circles of munich society and became associated with wartime general erich ludendorff during this time. the beer hall putsch encouraged by this early support hitler decided to use ludendorff as front in an to seize power later known as the beer hall putsch and sometimes as the hitler putsch munich putsch. the nazi party had copied the italian in appearance and also had adopted some programmatical points and now in the turbulent year  hitler wanted to emulate benito march on rome by staging his own campaign in berlin. hitler and ludendorff obtained the clandestine support of gustav von kahr bavaria's de facto ruler along with leading figures in the reichswehr and the police. as political posters show ludendorff hitler and the heads of the bavarian police and military planned on forming new government. however on november   kahr and the military withdrew their support during a meeting in the brgerbrukeller a large beer hall outside of munich. a surprised hitler had them arrested and proceeded with the coup. unknown to him kahr and the other detainees had been released on ludendorff's orders after he obtained their word not to interfere. that night they prepared resistance measures against the coup and in the morning when hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the bavarian war ministry to overthrow the bavarian government as a start to their march on berlin the army quickly dispersed them ludendorff was wounded and a few other nazis were killed. hitler fled to the home of ernst and contemplated suicide. he was soon arrested for high treason and appointed alfred rosenberg as temporary leader of the party but found himself in an environment somewhat receptive to his beliefs. during hitler's trial sympathetic magistrates allowed hitler to turn his debacle into a propaganda stunt. he was given almost unlimited amounts of time to present his arguments to the court and his popularity soared when he voiced basic nationalistic sentiments shared by some of the public. on april   hitler was sentenced to five years imprisonment at landsberg prison for the crime of conspiracy to commit treason. hitler received favoured treatment from the guards and had much fan mail from fan hitler was released on december   after the authorities decided that he was not a danger to the public. including remand he had served just over one year of his five-year sentence. while at landsberg he dictated his political book mein kampf my struggle to his deputy rudolf hess. the book dedicated to thule society member dietrich eckart was both an autobiography and an exposition of his political ideology. it was published in two volumes in  and  respectively selling about  copies between  and  alone. by the end of the war about  million copies had been sold or distributed every newly-wed couple as well as front soldiers received free copies. hitler spent years dodging taxes on the royalties of his book and had accumulated a tax debt of about  german m in today's money by the time he became chancellor at which time his debt was waived.lt hitler dodged taxes expert finds bbc mythos ladenhter spiegel the rebuilding of the party at the time of hitler's release the political situation in germany had calmed down and the economy had improved which hampered hitler's opportunities for agitation. though the hitler putsch had given hitler some national prominence his party's mainstay was still munich. image:goebbels mit goebbels with adolf hitler at the obersalzberg possibly early . as hitler was still banned from public speeches he appointed gregor strasser who in  had been elected to the reichstag as reichsorganisationsleiter authorizing him to organise the party in northern germany. gregor joined by his younger brother otto and joseph goebbels steered an increasingly independent course emphasizing the socialist element in the party's programme. the arbeitsgemeinschaft der gauleiter nord-west became an internal opposition threatening hitler's authority but faction was defeated at the bamberg conference  during which goebbels joined hitler. after this encounter hitler centralized the party even more and asserted the fhrerprinzip as the basic principle of party organization. leaders were not elected by their group but were rather appointed by their superior and were answerable to them while demanding unquestioning obedience from their inferiors. consistent with hitler's disdain for democracy all power and authority devolved from the top down. a key element of hitler's appeal was his ability to convey a sense of offended national pride caused by the treaty of versailles imposed on the defeated second empire by the western allies. germany had lost economically important territory in europe along with its and in admitting to sole responsibility for the war had agreed to pay a huge world war i bill totaling  billion german gold most germans bitterly resented these terms but early nazi attempts to gain support by blaming these humiliations on international jewry were not particularly successful with the electorate. the party learned quickly and soon a more subtle propaganda emerged combining anti-semitism with an attack on the failures of the weimar system and the parties supporting it. having failed in overthrowing the republic by a coup hitler now pursued the strategy of legality: this meant formally adhering to the rules of the weimar republic until he had legally gained power and then transforming liberal democracy into a nazi dictatorship. some party members especially in the paramilitary opposed this strategy and ernst rhm ridiculed hitler as adolphe legalit. the road to power rise to power the political turning point for hitler came when the great depression hit germany in . the weimar republic had never been firmly rooted and was openly opposed by right-wing conservatives including monarchists communists and the nazis. as the parties loyal to the democratic parliamentary republic found themselves unable to agree on counter-measures their grand coalition broke up and was replaced by a minority cabinet. the new chancellor heinrich brning of the roman catholic centre party lacking a majority in parliament had to implement his measures through the president's emergency decrees. tolerated by the majority of parties the exception soon became the rule and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government. the reichstag's initial opposition to brnings measures led to premature elections in september . the republican parties lost their majority and their ability to resume the grand coalition while the nazis suddenly rose from relative obscurity to win . of the vote along with  seats in the reichstag becoming the second largest party in germany. image:hitler walking out of brown house after  emerges from the brown house in munich headquarters of the nazi party during the last days of the weimar republic after a post-election meeting in . brnings measure of budget consolidation and financial austerity brought little economic improvement and was extremely unpopular. under these circumstances hitler appealed to the bulk of german farmers war veterans and the middle-class had been hard-hit by both the inflation of the 1920s and the unemployment of the depression. hitler received little response from the urban working classes and traditionally catholic regions. meanwhile on september   hitler's niece geli raubal was found dead in her bedroom in his munich apartment his half-sister angela and her daughter geli had been with him in munich since  an apparent suicide. geli was  years younger than he was and had used his gun drawing rumours of a relationship between the two. the event is viewed as having caused lasting turmoil for him. in  hitler intended to run against the aging president of paul von hindenburg in the scheduled german presidential election elections. though hitler had left austria in  he still had not acquired german citizenship and hence could not run for public office. in february however the state government of in which the nazi party participated appointed hitler to some minor administrative post and also gave him citizenship. the new german citizen ran against hindenburg who was supported by a broad range of reactionary nationalist monarchist catholic republican and even social democratic parties and against the communist presidential candidate. his campaign was called hitler ber deutschland hitler over germany. the name had a double meaning. image:hitler ueber deutschland over germany. political campaign by aircraft. besides an obvious reference to hitler's dictatorial intentions it also referred to the fact that hitler was campaigning by aircraft. this was a brand new political tactic that allowed hitler to speak in two cities in one day which was practically unheard of at the time. hitler came in second on both rounds attaining more than  of the vote during the second one in april. although he lost to hindenburg the election established hitler as a realistic and fresh alternative in german politics. the cabinets of papen and schleicher president hindenburg influenced by the camarilla became increasingly estranged from brning and pushed his chancellor to move the government in a decidedly authoritarian and right-wing direction. this culminated in may  with the resignation of the brning cabinet. hindenburg appointed the nobleman franz von papen as chancellor heading a cabinet of barons. papen was bent on authoritarian rule and since in the reichstag only the conservative german national people's supported his administration he immediately called for new elections in july. in these elections the nazis achieved their biggest success yet and won  seats. the nazis had become the largest party in the reichstag without which no stable government could be formed. papen tried to convince hitler to become vice-chancellor and enter a new government with a parliamentary basis. hitler however rejected this offer and put further pressure on papen by entertaining parallel negotiations with the centre party party papen's former party which was bent on bringing down the renegade papen. in both negotiations hitler demanded that he as leader of the strongest party must be chancellor but president hindenburg consistently refused to appoint the bohemian private to the chancellorship. after a motion of no of no-confidence in the papen government supported by  of the deputies the new reichstag was dissolved and new elections called in november. this time the nazis lost some votes but still remained the largest party in the reichstag. after papen failed to secure a majority he proposed to dissolve the parliament again along with an indefinite postponement of elections. hindenburg at first accepted this but after general kurt von schleicher and the military withdrew their support hindenburg instead dismissed papen and appointed schleicher who promised he could secure a majority government by negotiations with both the social democrats the trade unions and dissidents from the nazi party under gregor strasser. in january  however schleicher had to admit failure in these efforts and asked hindenburg for emergency powers along with the same postponement of elections that he had opposed earlier to which the president reacted by dismissing schleicher. hitlers appointment as chancellor meanwhile papen resentful because of his dismissal tried to get his revenge on schleicher by working toward the general's downfall through forming an intrigue with the camarilla and alfred hugenberg media mogul and chairman of the german national people's also involved were hjalmar schacht fritz thyssen and other leading german businessmen. they financially supported the nazi party which had been brought to the brink of bankruptcy by the cost of heavy campaigning. the businessmen also wrote letters to hindenburg urging him to appoint hitler as leader of a government independent from parliamentary parties which could turn into a movement that would enrapture millions of people.ltrefgtltcitegtdie bertragung der

coalition government formed by the nsdap and german national people's hitler and two other nazi ministers wilhelm hermann were to be contained by a framework of conservative cabinet ministers most notably by papen as vice-chancellor of chancellor and by hugenberg as minister of economics. papen wanted to use hitler as a figure-head but the nazis had gained key positions most notably the ministry of the interior. on the morning of january   in hindenburg's office adolf hitler was sworn in as chancellor during what some observers later described as a brief and simple ceremony. reichstag fire and the march elections having become chancellor hitler foiled all attempts to gain a majority in parliament and on that basis persuaded president hindenburg to dissolve the reichstag again. elections were scheduled for early march but on february   the reichstag building was set on fire. since a marinus van der independent communist was found in the building the fire was blamed on a communist plot to which the government reacted with the reichstag fire decree of february  which suspended basic rights including habeas corpus. under the provisions of this decree the communist party of communist party and other groups were suppressed and communist functionaries and deputies were arrested put to flight or murdered. in the same month hitler reportedly banned gay pornography

coalition with the german national people's as the coalition had a slim majority. the day of potsdam and the enabling act on  march the new reichstag was constituted itself with an impressive opening ceremony held at potsdam's garrison church. this day of potsdam was staged to demonstrate reconciliation and union between the revolutionary nazi movement and old prussia with its elites and virtues. hitler himself appeared not in nazi uniform but in a tail coat and humbly greeted the aged president hindenburg. because of the nazis failure to obtain a majority on their own hitler's government confronted the newly elected reichstag with the enabling act that would have vested the cabinet with legislative powers for a period of four years. though such a bill was not unprecedented this act was different since it allowed for deviations from the constitution. as the bill required a two-thirds majority in order to pass the government needed the support of other parties. the position of the catholic centre party party at this point the third largest party in the reichstag turned be decisive: under the leadership of ludwig kaas the party decided to vote for the enabling act. it did so in return for the government's oral guarantees regarding the roman catholic liberty the concordats signed by german states and the continued existence of the centre party itself. on  march the reichstag assembled in a replacement building under extremely turbulent circumstances. some men served as guards within while large groups outside building shouted slogans and threats toward the arriving deputies. kaas announced that the centre would support the bill amid concerns put aside. while social democrat otto wels denounced the act in his speech. end of the day all parties except the social democratic party of democrats voted in favour of the bill. the enabling act was dutifully renewed by the reichstag every four years even through world war ii. removal of remaining limits with this combination of legislative and executive power hitler's government further suppressed the remaining political opposition the communist party of and the social democratic party of were banned while all other political parties dissolved themselves. trade unions were merged with employers federations into an organisation under nazi control and the autonomy of german state governments was abolished.

power caused much anxiety among populace in general and especially among the military hitler used allegations a plot by the sa leader ernst rhm to purge the paramilitary force's leadership during the night of the long knives. opponents unconnected with the were also notably gregor strasser and former chancellor kurt von schleicher. president paul von hindenburg died on  august . rather than holding new presidential elections hitler's cabinet passed a law proclaiming the presidency dormant and transferred the role and powers of the head of state to hitler as fhrer und reichskanzler leader and chancellor. thereby hitler also became supreme commander of the military which then swore their military oath not to the state or the constitution but to hitler personally. in a mid-august plebiscite these acts found the approval of .ltrefgtfest joachim hitler new york: harcourt brace jovanovich  pp. of the electorate. combining the highest offices in state military and party in his

treaty and the jews along with other undesirable minority hitler oversaw one of the greatest expansions of industrial production and civil improvement germany had ever seen mostly based on debt flotation and expansion of the military. nazi policies toward women strongly encouraged them to stay at home to bear children and keep house. september  speech to the national socialist women's organization adolf hitler argued that for the german woman her world is her husband her family her children and her home a policy which was reinforced by the bestowing of the cross of honor of the german mother on women bearing four or more babies. the unemployment rate was cut substantially mostly arms production and sending women home so men could take their jobs. given this claims that the economy of economy achieved near full employment are at least partly artifacts of propaganda from the era. much of the financing for hitler's reconstruction and rearmament came from currency manipulation by hjalmar schacht including the clouded credits through the mefo bills. the negative effects of this inflation were offset in later years by the acquisition of foreign gold from the treasuries of conquered nations. image:hitler blondi popular photo theme was hitler and his dog blondi here seen at the terrace of the berghof hitler oversaw of the largest infrastructure-improvement

auschwitz. the massacres that led to the coining of the word genocide the final der jdischen frage or final solution of the jewish question were planned and ordered by leading nazis with heinrich playing a key role. while no specific order from hitler authorizing the mass killing of the jews has surfaced there is documentation showing that he approved the einsatzgruppen and the evidence also suggests that in the fall of  himmler and hitler agreed in principle on mass extermination by gassing. during interrogations by soviet intelligence officers declassified over fifty years later hitler's valet heinz linge and his military aide otto gunsche said hitler had pored over the first blueprints of gas chambers. to make for smoother cooperation in the implementation of this final solution the wannsee conference was held near berlin on january   with fifteen senior officials participating led by reinhard heydrich and adolf eichmann. the records of this meeting provide the clearest evidence of planning for the holocaust. on february  hitler was recorded saying to his associates we shall regain our health only by eliminating the jews. with leader ion antonescu far left. on march   hitler pressured his native austria into unification with germany the anschluss and a triumphal entry into vienna. next he intensified a crisis over the german-speaking sudetenland districts of czechoslovakia. this led to the munich agreement of september  which authorized the annexation and immediate military occupation of these districts by germany. as a result of the summit

a german protectorate of bohemia and after that hitler claimed german grievances relating to the free city of danzig and the polish corridor that germany had ceded under the treaty of treaty. britain had not been able to reach an agreement with the soviet union for an alliance against germany and on august   hitler concluded a secret non-aggression pact the molotov-ribbentrop pact with joseph on which it was likely agreed that the soviet union and nazi germany would partition poland. on september  germany invaded the western portion of poland. britain and france who had guaranteed assistance to poland declared war on germany. not long after this on september  soviet forces invaded eastern poland. britain and france who had guaranteed assistance to poland declared war on germany on september  but go to the offensive. during this so called phony war hitler built up his forces much further. in april  he ordered german forces to march into denmark and norway. in may  hitler ordered his forces to attack france conquering the netherlands luxembourg and belgium in the process. france on june  . this series of victories convinced his main ally benito mussolini of italy to join the

prelude of the planned german invasion. the attacks began by pounding the royal air airbases and the radar stations protecting south-east england. however the luftwaffe failed to defeat the royal air by the end of october . air superiority for the invasion code-named operation sealion could not be assured and hitler ordered bombing raids to be carried out on british cities including london and coventry mostly at night. image:ah raeder groadmiral erich raeder. on june   hitler gave signal three million german troops attack breaking the non-aggression pact he had concluded with stalin less

german german sixth army. both defeats were turning points in the war although the latter is more commonly considered primary. from this point on the quality of hitler's military judgment became increasingly erratic and germany's military and economic position deteriorated. hitler's health was deteriorating too. his left hand started shaking uncontrollably. the biographer ian kershaw believes he suffered from parkinson's disease. other conditions that are suspected by some to have caused some at least of his symptoms are methamphetamine addiction and syphilis. italians overthrew hitler's

driven the last german troops from soviet territory and began entering central europe. the western allies were also rapidly advancing into germany. the germans had lost the war from a military perspective but hitler allowed no negotiation with the allied forces and as a consequence the german military forces continued to fight. hitler's stubbornness and defiance of military realities also allowed the continued mass killing of jews and others to continue. he even issued the nero decree on march   ordering the destruction of what remained of german industry communications and transport. however albert speer who was in charge of that plan did not carry it out. the morgenthau plan for postwar germany promulgated by the allies aimed at a similar deindustrialization. in april  soviet forces were at the battle of of berlin. hitler's closest lieutenants urged him to flee to bavaria or austria to make a last stand in the mountains but he seemed determined to either live or die in the capital. leader heinrich himmler tried on his own to inform the allies through the diplomat count folke bernadotte that germany was prepared to discuss surrender terms. meanwhile hermann gring sent a telegram from bavaria in which he argued that since hitler was cut off in berlin as hitler's designated successor he should assume leadership of germany. hitler angrily reacted by dismissing both himmler and gring from all their offices and the party and declared them traitors. after intense urban combat when soviet troops were spotted within a block or two of the reich chancellory in the city centre hitler committed suicide in the fhrerbunker on april   by means of a self-delivered shot to the head it is likely he simultaneously bit into a cyanide ampoule. hitler's body and that of eva braun his long-term mistress whom he had married the day before were put in a bomb crater partially burned with gasoline by fhrerbunker aides and hastily buried in the chancellory garden as russian shells poured down and red army infantry continued to advance only two or three hundred metres away. he also had his dog blondi poisoned around the same time. when russian forces reached the chancellory they found his body and an autopsy was performed using dental records and german dental assistants who were familiar with them to confirm the identification. to avoid any possibility of creating a potential shrine the remains of hitler and braun were repeatedly moved then secretly buried by smersh at their new headquarters in magdeburg. in april  when the facility was about to be turned over to the east german government the remains were reportedly exhumed thoroughly and the ashes finally dumped unceremoniously into the elbe. according to the russian federal security service a fragment of human skull stored in its archives and displayed to the public in a  exhibition came from the remains of hitler's body uncovered by the red army in berlin and is all that remains of hitler however the authenticity of the skull has been challenged by many historians and researchers. at the time of hitler's death most of germany's infrastructure and major cities were in ruins and he had left explicit orders to complete the destruction. millions of germans were dead with millions more wounded or homeless. in his will he dismissed other nazi leaders and appointed grand admiral karl dnitz as reichsprsident president of germany and joseph as chancellor of germany. however goebbels and his wife magda committed suicide on  may . on  may  in rheims france the german armed forces unconditional unconditionally to the western allies and on  may  in berlin to the soviet union thus end of in the war in europe and with the creation of the allied control council on  june  the four

of the world as synonymous with evil. historical and hitler in popular portrayals of hitler in the west are by virtually universal consensus condemnatory. the copyright of hitler's book mein kampf in europe is claimed by the free state of bavaria and will expire in . reproductions in germany are generally authorized only for scholarly purposes and in heavily commented form. the situation is however unclear werner maser whom theodor heuss proposed to publish mein kampf as a weapon against nazi ideology comments that intellectual property cannot be confiscated and so it still would lie in the hands of hitler's nephew who however does not want to have anything to do with hitler's legacy. this situation lead to contested trials eg. in poland and sweden. mein kampf however is published in the usa as well as in other countries such as turkey and israel by publishers with various political positions. the display of swastikas or other nazi symbols is prohibited in germany and political extremists are generally under surveillance by the verfassungsschutz one of the federal or state-based offices for the protection of the constitution. there have been instances of public figures

catholic catholic parents but as a school boy began to reject church and catholicism. left home he never attended mass or received sacraments. later life hitler's religious beliefs present a discrepant picture: in statements frequently spoke positively about the heritage of german culture and belief in christ. hitlers private statements reported by his intimates are more mixed showing hitler as a religious but also of christianity. however in contrast to other nazi leaders hitler did not adhere to esoteric ideas occultism or neo-paganism and ridiculed such beliefs in his book mein kampf. rather hitler advocated a positive christianity a belief system purged from objected to in traditional christianity and reinvented jesus a fighter against the jews.fact hitler believed a social darwinist struggle for survival between the different races among which the aryan race  guided by providence  was supposed to be the torchbearers of civilization and the jews as enemies of all civilization. whether his anti-semitism was influenced by older christian ideas remains disputed. among christian denominations hitler favoured protestantism which was more open to such reinterpretations. at the same time he made use of some elements of the catholic church's hierarchical organisation liturgy and phraseology in his politics. hitler's medical health hitler's alleged health problems in his later years have long been the subject of debate and he has variously been suggested to have suffered from irritable bowel syndrome skin lesions irregular heartbeat tremors on the left side of his body syphilis parkinson's disease and a strongly suggested addiction to methamphetamine. most of hitler's biographers have characterized him as a vegetarian who abstained from eating meat beginning in the early 1930s until his death although his actual dietary habits appear inconsistent and are sometimes hotly disputed. there are reports of him disgusting his guests by giving them graphic accounts of the slaughter of animals in an effort to make them shun meat. a fear of cancer which his mother died from is the most widely cited reason though many authors also assert hitler had a profound and deep love of animals. he did consume dairy products and eggs however. martin bormann constructed a large greenhouse close to the berghof near berchtesgaden in order to ensure a steady supply of fresh fruits and vegetables for hitler throughout the war. personal photographs of bormann's children tending the greenhouse survive and by  its foundations were among the only ruins visible in the area which were directly associated with nazi leaders. for more information on this topic see vegetarianism of adolf hitler. hitler was also a dedicated non-smoker and promoted aggressive anti-smoking campaigns throughout germany. he reportedly promised a gold watch to any of his close associates who quit and actually gave a few away. several witness accounts relate that immediately after his suicide was confirmed many officers aides and secretaries in the fhrerbunker lit cigarettes.ltrefgtjohn toland toland ltcitegtadolf p. contrary to popular accounts there seems to be some evidence hitler did not abstain entirely from alcohol. after the war an interrogation in the ussr of his valet heinz linge could indicate that hitler drank champagne now and then with

14	 the todd on innuendo sexual innuendo hard topic to stay on top of. as a humor tool it stands erect in the english language. while there are no hard and fast rules as to what constitutes sexual innuendo there have been many mass-debates on the topic and now the general principles at the root of the topic are firm and well-rounded. however full penetration of the subject requires that the reader take a long hard look at the target and be a cunning linguist in order to avoid limp phrases and imbibe the phrase with a large handful of meanings. the topic can become hot by attempting to grasp it and the more one experiments with it the more interested they become. also as the language changes innuendos must change in order to fill the newly created holes and satisfy listeners. a common problem with sexual innuendo is the recipient being unable to wrap their hands around the intended meaning. in this case an individual using sexual innuendo will often start slow and eventually build up increasing depth more and more until the recipient feels the actual thrust of the point and the innuendo climaxes. an innuendo is always the most pleasing when no one sees it coming often by entering the mind through the rear. some skilled people are even able to use several sexual innuendos quickly in succession resulting in multiple innuendo-esque climaxes. key phrases can grasp the sentence by the ankles and part its long clauses allowing the orator to penetrate the essence of the sentence. in this regard the key is to avoid stiff rigid words for ones that give the meaning of the sentence a firm rise in innuendic possibilities. some regard sexual innuendo as an art it goes without saying that needs a certain level oral skills in order for fluidic exchange of innuendo to succeed. however this is not enough to fill the requirements. one needs to pay special attention to the region of the sentence to which the innuendo will enter. for lasting effects it is important to enter deep within the recipient's consciousness and to ensure that all the seeds of humor have flowed forth. this is not an easy task for most so it only through rigorous repetition of the insertion of sexual innuendo that one can fully master the uplifting effects it can have vocabulary.

14	to explain the origin of the common december 25th birth the winter solstice is the shortest day of the year with the shortest hours of sunlight in the northern hemisphere three days after the solstice the hours of sunlight can be seen to be increasing. this marks the birth of a god of light or sun god. another christian-astrological similarity according to the film is that the three stars in orion's belt called the three kings align on december  with sirius the brightest star in the sky and point to the sun's rise on the horizon. this time is equated to the nativity of jesus where according to the popular christian myth three kings follow the star in the east to locate the place of jesus birth. furthermore around december  the sun rises in the vicinity of virgo the constellation known as virgin which refers to the origin of jesus virgin birth. comparison of sunset in the vicinity of crux with jesus death on the cross is based on a similar principle. in addition parallels such as walking on water reflection at helping the blind see without light there's nothing black with light one can see again and turning water into wine ripening of grapes are shown as metaphoric miracles explained as the influence of the sun.

14	it seems this version of events was promulgated by the wall street journal. in fact draper describes the development of easywriter on his own webpage as follows : draper was in prison in california at the time but under a work furlough program. this meant that whilst he had to spend every night in prison he spent each day working a regular job outside prison. this job was at receiving studios a small band practice studio and whilst there he had access to a computer where he coded easywriter. he did take copies of the code home to prison overnight to work on it. the implication by the wall street journal that he wrote the code in prison only to enter it into a computer after completion is clearly a misleading exaggeration. draper later ported easywriter to the ibm pc beating bill gates on the bid for the ibm contract.

14	ecological mass tourism emt  when people think about the word ecological mass tourism they normally link it with negative thoughts of mass tourism that is associated with environmental degradation. the truth is we believe that ecological mass tourism is beneficial for everyone but in essence we must first understand what ecological mass tourism actually encompasses: mass tourism: refers to the steady stream of large numbers of tourists to holiday destinations. ecotourism nature based tourism involving the education and interpretation of the natural environment and is managed to be ecologically sustainable. this definition also recognises that natural environment includes cultural components and that ecologically sustainable involves an appropriate return to the local community and long term conservation of the resource ecotourists: are tourists who participate in different sorts of nature based tourism. furthermore most ecotourists are often found to be residents of the developed world with above average incomes and educations. by integrating all  words into  we have constructed our definition of ecological mass tourism or emt for short. ecological mass tourism or emt: are large numbers of educated tourists and ecotourists participating within the realms of diversified forms of managed ecotourism. emt also attracts tourists who not only participate in ecotourism but also recognise its cultural components and its involvement with giving a fitting return to the local community and long term conservation of the resource. in properly defining emt we believe that it is beneficial to all parties involved and more importantly it can also be perceived to be sustainable. in addition to this emt also has the ability to be managed properly and has definite infrastructure cultural and social benefits linked ecological mass tourism does not go against the principle of mass tourism on the basis that it contains financial cultural and social benefits associated with its concept. 
14	from of life on earth by rowland benjamin during the cambrian an explosion of shelled marine animals was followed by the first mass extinction. sudden global cooling may have been the cause. about  of all species were lost. the earliest fish appeared in the ordovician but the end of this period saw the second mass extinction that wiped out trilobites. in the silurian life moved from the oceans onto land for the first time in the form of plants while in the seas the first coral reefs formed. the age of the fishes in the devonian period was permitted by the dominance of coral reef environments in the oceans. animals followed plants onto the land with the first amphibians appearing together with the first spiders and woody stems in plants that gave rise to primitive trees. the third mass extinction of marine animals occurred towards the end of the devonian about  million years ago. gigantic primitive trees dominated the land forming coal swamps in the carboniferous permitting evolution of winged insects and the first reptiles. sudden global climate change was probably the cause. about  of species were lost. the permian saw the rise of reptiles amphibians and conifers and the first beetles but the largest extinction of all time the fourth mass extinction at the end of the period  million years ago saw greater than  of all species on earth become extinct. the extinction was probably caused by a combination of factors: a shift in the position of the earths land masses plate tectonics movement and a giant meteorite impact off the coast of western australia both of which resulted in climate change. the age of reptiles followed with the evolution and diversification of dinosaurs and flying reptiles during the triassic and jurassic. the first modern corals arose as did the earliest birds. in the cretaceous period we find evidence of the first flowering plants and the first mammals. mammals lived along side the dinosaurs for  million years. the fifth mass extinction at the end of the cretaceous  million years ago was the most famous because it saw the extinction of  of all species including the dinosaurs. an asteroid probably caused this extinction. evidence of this is a crater approximately km in diameter preserved off the coast of mexico. the tertiary palaeogene and neogene period heralded the age of mammals. an explosion in insects and the appearance of bats in the palaeocene was followed by the evolution of primitive horses and cattle in the eocene during the last greenhouse climate. ice caps developed over the poles in the oligocene and the first apes appeared. an explosion of flowering plants in the miocene has led to the dominance of this plant lineage in the flora of the present where  of all plant species are flowering plants. the first human ancestors that walked on two legs branched off from other apes around  million years ago in the pliocene and evolved at the time of a rapid diversification in mammals and birds. early humans evolved in africa during the great ice ages of the stone age during the pleistocene. the last ice age occurred around  years ago. the sixth mass extinction began at the end of the pleistocene with the extinction of large mega-fauna such as mammoths sabre-tooth tigers and giant wombat-like diprotodons but it has continued to occur right up to the present day. figures vary but it has been estimated that currently between  and  species go extinct annually. extinction removes groups of species and in the vacuum that is created new groups appear. the fifth extinction removed the dinosaurs and with the dominant predators gone mammals seized the opportunity and quickly spread over the planet specializing diversifying and growing in size. the conditions that followed from this mass extinction also provided the opportunity for the evolution of an intelligent species of mammal  the homo sapiens. modern humans evolved around  years ago in eastern africa spread all over the earth and have come to dominate the earth over the most recent epoch known as the holocene. humans began disrupting the environment as soon as they appeared on earth but increased pressure on the environment when they began migrating out of africa and spreading throughout the world about  years ago. fossil records clearly show that as soon as humans arrived in a new region native species became extinct. species that had never experienced contact with humans before were probably hunted to extinction. humans arrived in the middle east about  years ago and in europe  years ago. the neanderthals who had been in europe for about  years lived along side early humans for about another  years but then disappeared either wiped out by warfare or by being unable to compete with humans for food and shelter. humans arrived in north america about  years ago and wiped out the mammoths and mastodons. wherever humans migrated species disappeared. massive pressure on the environment came about when humans invented agriculture about  years ago. agriculture may have been invented in middle east or in different places but over a short time it spread around the entire globe. the use of agriculture accelerated the pace of the extinction. a natural system only allows a limited number of a given species to inhabit a given area. agriculture enabled the human population size to expand because it allowed it to exceed the carrying capacity of the local ecosystem. humans could produce food for immediate use storage or trade and could overpopulate. by domesticating plants and animals they became the first species to live outside ecosystems. traditional farming destroys ecosystems. it turns biodiversity into monoculture. it defines native plant and animal species as weeds and pests. the current mass extinction is caused by humans through such activities as: the transmission of invasive species across ecosystems the spread of agriculture the transformation of the landscape urbanisation overexploitation of species and natural resources the rate of extinction increases as the effects of these causes interact with each other. genetic pollution from genetically modified organisms and climate change from burning fossil fuels will have a greater influence on the rate of extinction in the future. the sixth mass extinction is different from all previous extinctions because it has a biotic rather than a physical cause. humans are causing vast physical changes on the planet. the rate of extinction has been increasing with time. the process started slowly  years ago but is has got faster. the process has been particularly rapid over the past  years since the industrial revolution. the earth has always recovered after mass extinctions given sufficient time millions of years and when the physical cause ice from an ice age or debris from a meteorite impact has gone. we are the cause of the sixth extinction. unless we modify our behaviour the sixth extinction will continue and future generations will inherit a more impoverished and unhealthy planet. the earth may no longer support us and we may become extinct.

14	zeus zews ancient greek:  zes zdes modern greek:  das i.as was the sky and thunder god in ancient greek religion who ruled as king of the gods of mount olympus. his name is cognate with the first element of his roman equivalent jupiter. zeus is the child of cronus and rhea the youngest of his siblings to be born though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from cronos's stomach. in most traditions he is married to hera by whom he is usually said to have fathered ares hebe and hephaestus. at the oracle of dodona his consort was said to be dione by whom the iliad states that he fathered aphrodite. zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. these resulted in many godly and heroic offspring including athena apollo artemis hermes persephone dionysus perseus heracles helen of troy minos and the muses. he was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods and assigned the others to their roles: even the gods who are not his natural children address him as father and all the gods rise in his presence. he was equated with many foreign weather gods permitting pausanias to observe that zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men. his symbols are the thunderbolt eagle bull and oak. in addition to his indo-european inheritance the classical cloud-gatherer greek:  nephelgereta also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the ancient near east such as the scepter. zeus is frequently depicted by greek artists in one of two poses: standing striding forward with a thunderbolt leveled in his raised right hand

from the proto-indo-european vocative dyeu-phtr deriving from the root dyeu to shine and in its many derivatives sky heaven god. zeus is the only deity in the olympic pantheon whose name has such a transparent indo-european etymology. the earliest attested forms of the name are the mycenaean greek  di-we and  di-wo written in the linear b syllabic script. plato in his cratylus gives a folk etymology of zeus meaning cause of life always to all things because of puns between alternate titles of zeus zen and dia with the greek words for life and because of. this etymology along with plato's entire method of deriving etymologies is not supported by modern scholarship. zeus at the getty villa a.d.    by unknown. cave of zeus mount ida crete. cronus sired several children by rhea: hestia demeter hera hades and poseidon but swallowed them all as soon as they were born since he had learned from gaia and uranus that he was destined to be overthrown by his son as he had previously overthrown uranus his own father an oracle that rhea heard and wished to avert. when zeus was about to be born rhea sought gaia to devise a plan to save him so that cronus would get his retribution for his acts against uranus and his own children. rhea gave birth to zeus in crete handing cronus a rock wrapped in swaddling clothes which he promptly swallowed. rhea hid zeus in a cave on mount ida in crete. according to varying versions of the story: .he was then raised by gaia. .he was raised by a goat named amalthea while a company of kouretes soldiers or smaller gods danced shouted and clashed their spears against their shields so that cronus would not hear the baby's cry see cornucopia. according to some versions of this story he was reared by amalthea in a cave called dictaeon andron psychro cave in lasithi plateau. .he was raised by a nymph named adamanthea. since cronus ruled over the earth the heavens and the sea she hid him by dangling him on a rope from a tree so he was suspended between earth sea and sky and thus invisible to his father. .he was raised by a nymph named cynosura. in gratitude zeus placed her among the stars. .he was raised by melissa who nursed

the glens of parnassus to be a sign to mortal men the omphalos then his siblings in reverse order of swallowing. in some versions metis gave cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the babies or zeus cut cronus stomach open. then zeus released the brothers of cronus the gigantes the hecatonchires and the cyclopes from their dungeon in tartarus killing their guard campe. as a token of their appreciation the cyclopes gave him thunder and the thunderbolt or lightning which had previously been hidden by gaia. together zeus and his brothers and sisters along with the gigantes hecatonchires and cyclopes overthrew cronus and the other titans in the combat called the titanomachy. the defeated titans were then cast into a shadowy underworld region known as tartarus. atlas one of the titans that fought against zeus was punished by having to hold up the sky. after the battle with the titans zeus shared the world with his elder brothers poseidon and hades by drawing lots: zeus got the sky and air poseidon the waters and hades the world of the dead the underworld. the ancient earth gaia could not be claimed she was left to all three each according to their capabilities which explains why poseidon was the earth shaker the god of earthquakes and hades claimed the humans that died see also penthus. gaia resented the way zeus had treated the titans because they were her children. soon after taking the throne as king of the gods zeus had to fight some of gaia's other children the monsters typhon and echidna. he vanquished typhon and trapped him under mount etna but left echidna and her children alive. zeus was brother and consort of hera. by hera zeus sired ares hebe and hephaestus though some accounts say that hera produced these offspring alone. some also include eileithyia and eris as their daughters. the conquests of zeus among nymphs and the mythic mortal progenitors of hellenic dynasties are famous. olympian mythography even credits him with unions with leto demeter dione and maia. among mortals were semele io europa and leda for more details see below and with the young ganymede although he was mortal zeus granted him eternal youth and immortality. many myths render hera as jealous of his amorous conquests and a consistent enemy of zeus mistresses and their children by him. for a time a nymph named echo had the job of distracting hera from his affairs by talking incessantly and when hera discovered the deception she cursed echo to repeat the words of others. dione or thalassa aphrodite mnemosyne .muses original three .aoide .muses later nine .calliope

version athena is said to be born parthenogenetically. helen was either the daughter of leda or nemesis. tyche is usually considered a daughter of aphrodite and hermes. roman marble colossal head of zeus 2nd century ad british museum zeus played a dominant role presiding over the greek olympian pantheon. he fathered many of the heroes and was featured in many of their local cults. though the homeric cloud collector was the god of the sky and thunder like his near-eastern counterparts he was also the supreme cultural artifact in some senses he was the embodiment of greek religious beliefs and the archetypal greek deity. aside from local epithets that simply designated the deity to doing something random at some particular place the epithets or titles applied to zeus emphasized different aspects of his wide-ranging authority: zeus olympios emphasized zeus's kingship over both the gods in addition to his specific presence at the panhellenic festival at olympia. zeus panhellenios zeus of all the hellenes to whom aeacus famous temple on aegina was dedicated. zeus xenios philoxenon or hospites: zeus was the patron of hospitality xenia and guests ready to avenge any wrong done to a stranger. zeus horkios: zeus he was the keeper of oaths. exposed liars were made to dedicate a statue to zeus often at the sanctuary of olympia. zeus agoraeus: zeus watched over business at the agora and punished dishonest traders. zeus aegiduchos or aegiochos: zeus was the bearer of the aegis with which he strikes terror into the impious and his enemies. others derive this epithet from  goat and  and take it as an allusion to the legend of zeus suckling at the breast of amalthea. additional names and epithets for zeus are also: zeus meilichios easy-to-be-entreated: zeus subsumed an archaic chthonic daimon propitiated in athens meilichios. zeus tallaios solar zeus: the zeus that was worshiped in crete. zeus labrandos: he was worshiped at caria. his sacred site was labranda and he was depicted holding a double-edged axe labrys-labyrinth. he is connected with the hurrian god of sky and storm teshub. zeus naos and bouleus: forms of zeus worshipped at dodona the earliest oracle. his priests the selloi are sometimes thought to have given their name to the hellenes. zeus gergos    earth worker farmer the god of crops and harvest in athens. zeus kasios: the zeus of jebel aqra on the syrianturkish border a hellenization of baal zephon ithomatas: the zeus of mount ithome in messenia diktaios: local epithet of zeus on crete since the mycenaean times pertaining to the dikte mountain range bottiaeus: epithet of zeus at antioch according to libanius marble eagle from the sanctuary of zeus hypsistos archaeological museum of dion. the major center where all greeks converged to pay honor to their chief god was olympia. their quadrennial festival featured the famous games. there was also an altar to zeus made not of stone but of ash from the accumulated remains of many centuries worth of animals sacrificed there. outside of the major inter-polis sanctuaries there were no modes of worshipping zeus precisely shared across the greek world. most of the titles listed below for instance could be found at any number of greek temples from asia minor to sicily. certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar for instance. with one exception greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of zeus as crete. minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient greek religion: by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new will durant observed and cretan zeus retained his youthful minoan features. the local child of the great mother a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort whose minoan name the greeks hellenized as velchanos was in time assumed as an epithet by zeus as transpired at many other sites and he came to be venerated in crete as zeus velchanos boy-zeus often simply the kouros. in crete zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at knossos ida and palaikastro. in the hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to zeus velchanos was founded at the hagia triada site of a long-ruined minoan palace. broadly contemporary coins from phaistos show the form under which he was worshiped: a youth sits among the branches of a tree with a cockerel on his knees. on other cretan coins velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage. inscriptions at gortyn and lyttos record a velchania festival showing that velchanios was still widely venerated in hellenistic crete. the stories of minos and epimenides suggest that these caves were once for incubatory divination by kings and priests. the dramatic setting of plato's laws is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site emphasizing archaic cretan knowledge. on crete zeus was represented art as a long haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as ho megas kouros the great youth. ivory statuettes of the divine boy were unearthed near the labyrinth at knossos by sir arthur evans. with the kouretes a band of ecstatic armed dancers he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the cretan paideia. the myth of the death of cretan zeus localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source callimachus together with the assertion of antoninus liberalis that a fire shone forth annually from the birth-cave the infant shared with a mythic swarm of bees suggests that velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit. the hellenistic writer euhemerus apparently proposed a theory that zeus had actually been a great king of crete and that posthumously his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. the works of euhemerus himself have not survived but christian patristic writers took up the suggestion. for more details on this topic see lykaia. laurel-wreathed head of zeus on a gold stater lampsacus c  bc cabinet des mdailles. the epithet zeus lykaios wolf-zeus is assumed by zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the lykaia on the slopes of mount lykaion wolf mountain the tallest peak in rustic arcadia zeus had only a formal connection with the rituals and myths of this primitive rite of passage with an ancient threat of cannibalism and the possibility of a werewolf transformation for the ephebes who were the participants. near the ancient ash-heap where the sacrifices took place was a forbidden precinct in which allegedly no shadows were ever cast. according to plato a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every nine years to zeus lykaios and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal's. whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended. there were games associated with the lykaia removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of arcadia megalopolis there the major temple was dedicated to zeus lykaios. additional cults of zeus although etymology indicates that zeus was originally a sky god many greek cities honored a local zeus who lived underground. athenians and sicilians honored zeus meilichios kindly or honeyed while other cities had zeus chthonios earthy zeus katachthonios under-the-earth and zeus plousios wealth-bringing. these deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art or for emphasis as both together in one image. they also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits as did chthonic deities like persephone and demeter and also the heroes at their tombs. olympian gods by contrast usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars. in some cases cities were not entirely sure whether the daimon to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground zeus. thus the shrine at lebadaea in boeotia might belong to the hero trophonius or to zeus trephonius the nurturing depending on whether you believe pausanias or strabo. the hero amphiaraus was honored as zeus amphiaraus at oropus outside of thebes and the spartans even had a shrine to zeus agamemnon. in addition to the panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men. with the epithet zeus aetnaeus he was worshiped on mount aetna where there was a statue of him and a local festival called the aetnaea in his honor. other examples listed below. as zeus aeneius or zeus aenesius he was worshiped in the island cephalonia where he had a temple on mount aenos. roman cast terracotta of ram-horned jupiter ammon 1st century ad museo barracco rome. although most oracle sites were usually dedicated to apollo the heroes or various goddesses like themis a few oracular sites were dedicated to zeus. the oracle at dodona the cult of zeus at dodona epirus where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium bc onward centered on a sacred oak. when the odyssey was composed circa  bc divination was done there by barefoot priests called selloi who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches. by the time herodotus wrote about dodona female priestesses called peleiades doves had replaced the male priests. zeus consort at dodona was not hera but the goddess dione  whose name is a feminine form of zeus. her status as a titaness suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-hellenic deity and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle. the oracle at siwa the oracle of ammon at the siwa oasis in the western desert of egypt did not lie within the bounds of the greek world before alexander's day but it already loomed large in the greek mind during the archaic era: herodotus mentions consultations with zeus ammon in his account of the persian war. zeus ammon was especially favored at sparta where a temple to him existed by the time of the peloponnesian war. after alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at siwa the figure arose in the hellenistic imagination of a libyan sibyl. zeus and foreign gods zeus was identified with the roman god jupiter and associated in the syncretic classical imagination see interpretatio graeca with various other deities such as the egyptian ammon and the etruscan tinia. he along with dionysus absorbed the role of the chief phrygian god sabazios in the syncretic deity known in rome as sabazius. the seleucid ruler antiochus iv epiphanes erected a statue of zeus olympios in the judean temple in jerusalem. hellenizing jews referred to this statue as baal shamen in english lord of heaven. in neoplatonism zeus relation to the gods familiar from mythology is taught as the demiurge or divine mind. specifically within plotinus work the enneads and the platonic theology of proclus. zeus in the bible zeus is mentioned in the bible two times: first is in acts :-: when the people living in lystra saw apostle paul heal a lame man they considered paul his partner barnabas to be gods identifying paul with hermes and barnabas with zeus even trying to offer sacrifices with the crowd to them. two ancient inscriptions discovered in  from close of lystra testify to the worship of these two gods in that city. one of the inscriptions refers to the priests of zeus and the other mentions hermes most great and zeus the sun-god. another occurrence is in acts :: the name of the ship in which the prisoner paul set sail from the island of malta bore the figurehead sons of zeus aka castor and pollux. apocryphal book of  maccabees :  talks of king antiochus iv epiphanes who in his attempt to stamp out the jewish religion directed that the temple at jerusalem be profaned and rededicated to zeus jupiter olympius. depictions of zeus as a bull the form he took when raping europa are found on the greek euro coin and on the united kingdom identity card for visa holders. mary beard professor of classics at cambridge university has criticised this for its apparent celebration of rape. the rape of europa jean-franois de troy article a list format that may be better presented using prose. you can help by converting this article to prose if appropriate. editing help available. october  zeus is sometimes depicted as middle-aged man strong muscular arms. his facial hair a full beard and mustache to just stubble. zeus turned pandareus to stone for stealing the golden dog which had guarded him as an infant in the holy dictaeon cave of crete. zeus killed salmoneus with a thunderbolt for attempting to impersonate him riding around in a bronze chariot and loudly imitating thunder. zeus turned periphas into an eagle making him the king of birds. at the marriage of zeus and hera a nymph named chelone refused to attend. zeus transformed her into a tortoise chelone in greek. zeus with hera turned king haemus and queen rhodope into mountains the balkan mountains or stara planina and rhodope mountains respectively for their vanity. zeus condemned tantalus to eternal torture in tartarus for trying to trick the gods into eating the flesh of his butchered son pelops. zeus condemned ixion to be tied to a fiery wheel for eternity as punishment for attempting to violate hera. zeus blinded the seer phineus and sent the harpies to plague him as punishment for revealing the secrets of the gods. zeus rewarded tiresias with a life three times the norm as reward for ruling in his favour when he and hera contested which of the sexes gained the most pleasure from the act of love. zeus punished hera by having her hung upside down from the sky when she attempted to drown heracles in a storm. of all the children zeus spawned heracles was often described as his favorite. indeed heracles was often called by various gods and people as the favorite son of zeus zeus and heracles were very close and in one story where a tribe of earth-born giants threatened olympus and the oracle at delphi decreed that only the combined efforts of a lone god and mortal could stop the creature zeus chose heracles to fight by his side. they proceeded to defeat the monsters. athena has at times been called his favorite daughter and adviser. his sacred bird was the golden eagle which he kept by his side at all times. like him the eagle was a symbol of strength courage and justice. his favourite tree was the oak symbol of strength. olive trees were also sacred to him. zelus nike cratos and bia were zeus retinue. zeus condemned prometheus to having his liver eaten by a giant eagle for giving the flames of olympus to the mortals. when hera gave birth to hephaestus zeus threw him off the top of mount olympus because of his repulsive appearance. genealogy of the olympians in greek mythology genealogy of the olympians in

14	 lyrical poet . her greatest popularity in america was attained in the 1920s and 1930s. since then she has been largely ignored by both the public and academics. her reputation was damaged by poetry she wrote in support of the allied war effort during world war ii. merle rubin noted she seems to have caught more flak from the literary critics for supporting democracy than ezra pound did for championing fascism.

14	mike parr is widely regarded as one of the most gifted living australian artists and as the most outstanding australian artist of his generation. his work is imbued with a strongly cathartic presence a direct result of his personally demanding working processes. mike parr has realised over one thousand works within the context of his self-imposed self-portrait series in a range of media that includes performance installation sculpture drawing drypoint etching and photography. 
14	dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals that were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates for over  million years from the late triassic period about  million years ago until the end of the cretaceous about  million years ago. the extinction of most dinosaur species occurred during the cretaceoustertiary extinction event. the fossil record indicates that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs during the jurassic period. some of them survived the cretaceoustertiary extinction event including the ancestors of all modern birds. consequently in modern classification systems birds are considered a type of dinosaurthe only group of which that has survived to the present day. 
14	animal are a major group of multicellular eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom animalia or metazoa. their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on in their life. most animals are motile meaning they can move spontaneously and independently. all animals are also heterotrophs meaning they must ingest other organisms for sustenance.

14	australian rules also dictate that if you lose the game with all seven balls remainding on the table you have been pantsed and will do  full lap of the pool table with your pants around your ankle. alternatively if you are a woman you may wish to donate your bra to the barkeep where it will be displayed above the bar! these rules also apply when playing puckpool a new updated version of ball! 
14	also synonymous to australia are nsw pub rules design to make the games quick. foul shots are not rewarded with two shots the player simply hands control of the game back to his opponent who has only one shot. deliberate foul shots are not allowed and can result in an automatic lost of game. a futher twist played in some pubs is a modifcation on going in off the black if the player goes in off the black at any time during the game it's game over. 
14	another so called pub rule is that if the cue ball finished against the cushion a player may move it outward by a distance equal to width of the base of their cue. this will typically be done by placing the cue onto the table in the location of the cue ball and positioning the cue ball in front of it. 
14	also the making of electricity can sometimes be harmful to the earth. using coal and natural gases to make electricity releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. the carbon dioxide rises up into the atmosphere and traps to much of the suns heat. for years carbon dioxide has kept the earth warm but now there is to much and it is effecting the climate with too much heat. there are some gases like oxegen that lets the heat out but the carbon dioxide is trapping so much heat it is leading to global warming. global warming is where the earth gets warmer and could melt the south and north poles rising water levels and that water could flood low level islands and some small islands could dissapear alltogether. global warming also means more and worse sun burns and skin cancer it could also kill some animals maybe even species and if global warming increases at this rate earth could soon become as plain and hot as venus. so think of new ways to make electricity like the fuel cell which is powered by atoms to make water. 
14	all matter is made up of atoms. in the centre of an atom is a nucleus made up of protons and neutrons. surrounding the nucleus there is a lot of empty space with tiny particles called electrons orbiting. neutrons have no electrical charge protons carry a positive charge and electrons are negatively charged. the positive and negative charges attract each other. electrons can be freed from their orbit around the nucleus and made to move. rubbing objects can cause electrons to be added or removed from the object. the object then becomes charged because it no longer has the same number of electrons as protons. in the example shown in diagram . when a perspex rod is rubbed with a silk cloth electrons move from the rod to the cloth leaving the rod positively charged and the cloth negatively charged. diagram .  attraction when electrons are moved to or from an object that object becomes charged. this means it may attract or repel other objects for example if the now positively charged rod is placed near your hair it will cause the electrons in your hair to move towards the end of the hair see diagram .. your hair will become attracted to the positive charged rod making it stand up. if a silk cloth is used to rub two ping-pong balls that are suspended close together they lose electrons to the silk cloth and the ping-pong balls both become positively charged repel each other and move apart. static electricity occurs when electric charges build up on an object but the electric charges cannot move around. there is another type of electricity current electricity which consists of a continuous flow of electrons. it requires a source of electrons and a pathway to carry or conduct them. the source of electrons might be a battery or a generator. current electricity must flow along a pathway usually metal called a conductor. a bulb or an electric appliance may be part of that pathway. electrons are returned to the battery or generator along the pathway completing the electric circuit. actewagl uses copper or aluminium for its conductors. some materials prevent the flow of electrons and are called insulators. current electricity flows because there is a difference in electrical pressure or potential between two points along a conductor. this potential difference is called voltage. electrons flow from an area of high potential to a point of lower potential or voltage through a continuous circle or circuit. series and parallel circuits diagram   series circuit an electric circuit is a combination of metal conductors and equipment that can include things such as switches and electric appliances. these circuits can be connected in two ways either in series or in parallel. diagram   parallel circuit a series circuit is when the electrons only have one path to travel along like a string of lights on a christmas tree see diagram . if one light globe does not work then the whole circuit is broken and will not work. a parallel circuit gives electricity a choice of paths to flow along. a parallel circuit has the advantage that if one globe does not work then all the other globes stay alight see diagram . houses are wired in parallel circuits. electric circuits can be connected to either a direct current dc or an alternating current ac electricity supply. in a direct current the stream of electrons flow in only one direction around the circuit from the negative terminal to the positive terminal see diagram . the current that flows in a circuit connected to a battery will be a direct current. most electric circuits are connected to an alternating current where electricity is generated by power stations and supplied through power points. the electrons move backwards and forwards around an electric circuit in this case see diagram . diagram  shows that electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal. in the early days the concept of electron flow was not fully understood so scientists randomly decided that current in a conductor flowed from the positive terminal and into the negative terminal. it is still convention today to show current flowing in this direction ie. opposite to electron flow.

14	electronics is the study and use of devices that operate by controlling the flow of electrons or other electric charged particles in devices such as thermionic valves and semiconductors. the pure study of such devices is considered as a branch of physics while the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems is part of the fields of electrical electronic and computer engineering. the main uses of electronic circuits are the controlling processing and distribution of information and the conversion and distribution of electric power. both of these uses involve the creation or detection of electromagnetic fields and electric currents. more broadly most electronics systems fall into the category of either control systems or communication systems. while electricity had been used for some time to transmit data over telegraphs and telephones the development of electronics truly began in earnest with the advent of radio. today electronic devices perform a much wider variety of tasks. one way of looking at an electronic system is to divide it into the following parts:  inputs  electrical or mechanical sensors or transducers which take signals in the form of temperature pressure etc. from the physical world and convert them into signals.  signal processing circuits  these consist of electronic components connected together to manipulate interpret and transform the signals.  outputs  actuators or other devices also transducers that transform signals back into useful physical form. take as an example a television. its input is a broadcast signal received by an antenna or fed in through a cable. signal processing circuits inside the television extract the brightness colour and sound information from this signal. the output devices are a cathode ray tube that converts electronic signals into a visible image on a screen and magnet driven audio speakers. ac electronics frequencies are ultimately limited by a heat dissipation barrier at around  gigahertz and a plasma resonance barrier at approximately  terahertz. instead of signals manifest in electrical currents signals in polaritonics are manifest as admixtures of lattice vibrations and electromagnetic waves and operate in the range of frequencies from  gigahertz to approximately  terahertz. photonics in which signals are manifest purely as electromagnetic waves propagating in non-dispersive media operates at frequencies on the order of hundreds of terahertz but is limited in functionality as compared to polaritonics or electronics. polaritonics bridges the gap between electronics and photonics. electrical connectors plugs and sockets etc.  magnetic amplifier toroid  transient voltage suppression diode  variable capacitance diode  field effect transistor  other active components  silicon controlled controlled rectifier scr  cathode ray tube  cathode ray tube  liquid crystal display  photovoltaic cell solar cell  dipole dipole  magnetic dipole loop most analog electronic appliances such as radio receivers are constructed from arrays of a few types of circuits.  electronic power supply computers electronic quartz and programmable logic controllers used to control industrial processes are constructed of digital circuits. digital signal processors are another example.  digital signal  field programmable gate array mixed-signal circuits also known as hybrid circuits are becoming increasingly common. mixed circuits contain both analog and digital components. analog to digital converters and digital to analog converters are the primary examples. other examples are transmission gates and buffers. heat generated by electronic circuitry must be dissipated to improve reliability. techniques for heat dissipation can include heatsinks and fan for air cooling and other forms of computer cooling such as liquid cooling for computers . associated with all electronic circuits is noise. types of noise include  shot noise in resistors.  thermal noise in resistors.  noise pink noise or flicker noise  mathematical methods of electronics list of electronics topics  electronics infoline directory for electronics projects  wikibooks electronics  electronics tutorials.com  williamson labs electronics tutorial  ian purdie's electronics tutorials  iguana labs electronics tutorials and kits  electronic meanings and acronyms  lessons in electric circuits  a free series of textbooks on the subjects of electricity and electronics.  radio-electronics.com free information and resources covering radio and electronics  a hobbyist wiki  ieee spectrum  electronix express

14	elves tend to be somewhat shorter and slimmer than normal humans. their features are finely chiseled and delicate and they speak in melodic tones. although they appear fragile and weak as a race they are quick and strong. elves often live as long as  years. they are nearly immune to sleep and charm spells and are adept at finding hidden objects. during combat elves receive  bonuses when attacking with swords and bows. elves also have infravision which allows them to see up to  in darkness. in add they cannot be raised from the dead however in bg they can be. 
14	the story of the elf and the human!! once upon a time there was an elf called daniel he was very small and didnt have many frends except one human girl called emma! emma loved daniel but he could neva see it he thought she was just very very friendly even wen she insisted on sleeping in his bed and gave him a nice hard rub down b sleeping. one day it occured to daniel that this was not how normal rub downs went. emma always insisted on being naked bofore swhe touched him and made sure he was protected daniel always went along and did as she sed as she was his only frend. daniel realised this wasnt normal when she bagan to play rough one night. the next morning emma woke up and saw that he gave her acupuntcher!!! but that night daniel realised that he always did love emma even tho he hurt her alot with his pin!!! emma soon had half elf half human babies that her and daniel ate for breakfast they lived happily ever after! that is how elves and humans do it!!!!!!! haha

14	many eastern orthodox theologians along with modern the second witness according to orthodox tradition is the prophet enoch who like elijah did not taste death in his life and so will taste death at the hands of antichrist before the second coming of christ. scenarios for these two are deemed forerunners to the second coming of christ. 
14	centuries after his departure the jews still await the coming of elijah to precede the coming of the messiah. as discussed above in some aspects of judaism there is a tradition of leaving an empty chair and a full goblet of wine at the passover feast table to serve as a reminder of his promised return. at one point during the feast participants may open a door in hopes that he will appear as a guest. similarly an empty chair is left in the room during a circumcision. in christianity there is a lot of controversy over whether elijah has returned or is still yet to return and if so how and with whom. many eastern orthodox and catholic theologians along with modern christian theologians of a conservative pre-millennial perspective believe that elijah must return to physically die here on earth eventually as one of the two witnesses in the book of revelation. the second witness according to many theologians is either the prophet enoch who like elijah did not taste death in his life and so will taste death at the hands of antichrist before the second coming of christ who in some traditions also never died. this plays into many eschatological scenarios for these two are deemed forerunners to the second coming of christ. the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints as mentioned previously in the latter-day saint section believes that elijah returned on april   in an appearance to joseph smith fulfilling a prophecy in malachi. the bah faith as mentioned above in the bah section believes elijah to have returned as the biblical prophet john the baptist and as the founder of the bb faith now the bayani faith the bb in  in shiraz iran.

14	 e-mail or email is short for electronic mail and refers to composing sending and receiving messages over electronic communication systems. most e-mail systems today use the internet and e-mail is the most popular use of the internet.
 an e-mail address is a string of the form jsmithcorporation.com. it should be readed as jsmith at corporation.com. the first part is the of the person and the second part is the of the computer in which that person has an e-mail account. on the early days of the internet e-mail had to include also the route of the message this is a path between the computer of the sender and the computer of the receivers. nowadays these routes are calculated automatically based on dns records.
 e-mail messages usually have at least four fields:
  from  the e-mail address of the sender of the message
  to  the e-mail address of the receiver of the message
  subject  a brief summary of the contents of the message
  body  the message itself usually containing a signature block at the end
 the format of e-mail messages is defined in rfc  other fields include:
  cc  carbon copy because used carbon film to copy what was writed on them.
  bcc  blind carbon copy the recipient of this copy will not know who was in the to: field above
  attachments  files that complement the message
  date  date in which the e-mail was sent
  content-type  information about how the message has to be displayed usually a mime type.
 messages are exchanged between hosts using the mail transfer protocol with software like sendmail. users download their messages from servers usually with either the pop or imap protocols.

without parliament's consent although this concept was legally established only with the glorious revolution later in the century. the term english civil war appears most commonly in the singular form although historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. although the term describes events as impinging on england from the outset the conflicts involved wars with and civil

and scotland had both experienced relative peace both internally and in their relations with each other for as long as anyone could  charles hoped to unite the kingdoms of england scotland and ireland into a new single kingdom fulfilling the dream of his father james vi of scotland and i of many english parliamentarians had suspicions regarding such a move because they feared that setting up a new kingdom might destroy the old english traditions which had bound the english monarchy. as charles shared his father's position on the power of the crown james had described kings as little gods on

parliament in the english constitutional framework before the fighting the parliament of england did not have a large permanent role in the english system of government functioning as a temporary advisory committee summoned by the monarch whenever the crown required additional tax revenue and subject to dissolution by the monarch at any time. because responsibility for collecting taxes lay in the hands of the gentry the english kings needed the help of that stratum of society in order to ensure a continued stream of revenue. if the gentry refused to collect the king's taxes the crown would lack any practical means with which to compel them. parliaments allowed representatives of the gentry to meet confer and send policy-proposals to the monarch in the form of bills. these representatives did not however have any means of forcing their will upon the kingexcept by withholding the financial means required to execute his parliamentary concerns and the petition of right file:sir peter lely maria of maria painted by peter lely  one event to raise concerns over charles's reign was his marriage to a roman catholic french princess henrietta maria of maria in  directly after ascending the throne. charles's marriage raised the possibility that his children including an heir to the throne might grow up as a catholic an alarming prospect for officially protestant england where the church of england led by the supreme governor investing the head of church in the same person as the head of state in this instance the king.ref charles was keen to intervene on the protestant side of the thirty years war that was currently engulfing foreign wars necessitated heavy expenditures and the crown could raise taxes only through parliamentary consent. charles experienced further financial difficulty when his first parliament refused to assign him the traditional right to collect customs duties for his entire reign deciding instead to grant it only on a provisional basis and negotiate with charles meanwhile decided to send an expeditionary force to relieve the french huguenots whom french royal troops held besieged in la rochelle. military support for protestants on the continent was in itself popular both in parliament and with the protestant majority in generalcitation  and it had the potential to alleviate concerns brought about by the king's marriage to a catholic. however charles's insistence on having his unpopular royal favourite george villiers 1st duke of villiers the duke of buckingham assume command of the english force undermined that support. unfortunately for charles and buckingham the relief expedition proved a fiasco and parliament already hostile to buckingham for his monopoly on patronage opened impeachment proceedings against him. charles responded by dissolving parliament. this move while saving buckingham reinforced the impression that charles wanted to avoid parliamentary scrutiny of his ministers.ref having dissolved parliament and unable to raise money without it the king assembled a new one in . the elected members included oliver cromwell and edward coke. the new parliament drew the petition of right and charles accepted as a concession in order to obtain his subsidy. namepurkiss  amongst other things the petition referred to the magna carta.petition of right at iii vii. charles i avoided calling a parliament for the next decade a period known as the personal rule of charles i or the eleven years during this period charles lack of money determined policies. first and foremost to avoid parliament the king needed to avoid war. charles made peace with france and spain effectively ending england's involvement in the thirty years war however that in itself was far from enough to balance the crown's finances. unable to raise revenue through parliament  and unwilling to convene it  charles resorted to other means. one method was reviving certain conventions often long-outdated. for example a failure to attend and to receive knighthood at charles's coronation was a finable offence with the fine paid to the crown. the king tried to raise revenue through the ship money tax by exploiting a naval war-scare in  demanding that the inland english counties pay the tax the royal navy. established law supported this policy but authorities had ignored it for centuries and many regarded it as yet another extra-parliamentary and therefore illegal tax. some prominent men refused to pay ship money arguing that the tax was illegal but they lost in court and the fines imposed on them for refusing to pay ship money and for standing against the tax's legality aroused widespread indignation.ref during the personal rule charles aroused most antagonism through his religious measures: he believed in anglicanism a sacramental version of the church of england theologically based upon arminianism a creed shared with his main political advisor archbishop william in  charles appointed laud as archbishop of canterbury and started making the church more ceremonial replacing the wooden mass liturgycommunion tables with stone puritans accused laud of reintroducing catholicism when they complained he had them arrested. in  john bastwick henry burton burton and william prynne had their ears cut off for writing pamphlets attacking laud's viewsa rare penalty for and one that aroused moreover the church authorities revived the statutes passed in the time of elizabeth i about church attendance and fined puritans for not attending anglican church the end of charles's independent governance came when he attempted to apply the same religious policies in scotland. the church of scotland reluctantly episcopal in structure had independent charles however wanted one uniform church throughout and introduced a new high anglican version of the english book of common prayer to scotland in summer of . this was violently resisted a riot broke out in which may have been started in a church by jenny geddes. in february  the scots formulated their objections to royal policy in the national this document took the form of a loyal protest rejecting all innovations not first having been tested by free parliaments and general assemblies of the church. in the spring of  king charles i accompanied his forces to the scottish border to end the rebellion known as the bishops war. but after an inconclusive military campaign he accepted the offered scottish truce  the pacification of berwick. the truce proved temporary and a second war followed in summer of . this time a scots army defeated charles's forces in the north then captured newcastle upon charles eventually agreed not to interfere with scotland's religion and paid the scots war expenses.citation  recall of the english parliament charles needed to suppress the rebellion in scotland. he had insufficient funds however and needed to seek money from a newly elected short parliament in . the majority faction in the new parliament led by john pym took this appeal for money as an opportunity to discuss grievances against the crown and opposed the idea of an english invasion of scotland. charles took exception to this lese offence against the ruler and dissolved the parliament after only a few weeks hence the name the short parliament.ref without parliament's support charles attacked scotland again breaking the truce at berwick and suffered a comprehensive defeat. the scots went on to invade england occupying northumberland and durham. meanwhile another of charles chief advisors thomas wentworth 1st earl of wentworth 1st viscount wentworth had risen to the role of lord deputy of ireland in  and brought in much-needed revenue for charles by persuading the irish catholic gentry to pay new taxes in return for promised religious in  charles had recalled wentworth to england and in  made him earl of strafford attempting to have him achieve similar results in scotland. this time he proved less successful and the english forces fled the field in their second encounter with the scots in . almost the entirety of northern england was occupied and charles was forced to pay  per day to keep the scots from advancing. if he did not they would take the money by pillaging and burning the cities and towns of northern all this put charles in a desperate financial position. as king of scots he had to find money to pay the scottish army in england as king of england he had to find money to pay and equip an english army to defend england. his means of raising english revenue without an english parliament fell critically short of achieving this. namepurkiss  against this backdrop and according to advice from the magnum concilium the house of lords but without the house of commons of so not a parliament charles finally bowed to pressure and summoned another english parliament in november .ref of the long parliament the new parliament proved even more hostile to charles than its predecessor. it immediately began to discuss grievances against charles and his government and with pym and john of ship money fame in the lead took the opportunity presented by the king's troubles to force various reforming measuresincluding many with strong anti-papist themesupon the legislators passed a law which stated that a new parliament should convene at least once every three yearswithout the king's summons if necessary. other laws passed by the parliament made it illegal for the king to impose taxes without parliamentary consent and later gave parliament control over the king's ministers. finally the parliament passed a law forbidding the king to dissolve it without its consent even if the three years were up. ever since this parliament has been known as the long parliament. however parliament did attempt to avert conflict by requiring all adults to sign protestation of protestation an oath of allegiance to charles.see for some of the complexities of how the protestation was interpreted by different political actors. early in the long parliament's proceedings the house overwhelmingly accused thomas wentworth 1st earl of wentworth earl of strafford of high treason and other crimes and misdemeanors. henry vane the younger supplied evidence in relation to strafford's claimed improper use of the army in ireland alleging that strafford was encouraging the king to use his army raised in ireland to threaten england into compliance. this evidence was obtained from vane's father henry vane the elder a member of the king's privy council who refused to confirm it in parliament out of loyalty to charles. on  april pym's case collapsed but pym made a direct appeal to the henry vane the younger to produce a copy of the notes from the king's privy council discovered by the younger vane and secretly turned over to pym to the great anguish of the elder vane. these notes from the king's privy council contained evidence strafford had told the king sir you have done your duty and your subjects have failed in theirs and therefore you are absolved from the rules of government and may supply yourself by extraordinary ways you have an army in ireland with which you may reduce the  pym immediately launched a bill of attainder stating strafford's guilt and demanding that the earl be put to unlike a guilty finding in a court case attainder did not require a legal burden of proof but it did require royal king's approval. charles however guaranteed strafford that he would not sign the attainder without which the bill not furthermore the lords were opposed to the severity of the sentence of death imposed upon strafford. yet increased tensions and first army plot in the army to support strafford began to sway the on  april the commons passed the bill  in favour  opposed and  the lords acquiesced. charles still incensed over the commons handling of buckingham refused. strafford himself hoping to head off the war he saw looming wrote to the king and asked him to reconsider. nameabbottcite book i downfall of strafford and laud ll charles fearing for the safety of his family signed on  strafford was beheaded two days in the meantime both parliament and the king agreed to an independent investigation of the king's involvement in strafford's plot. the long parliament then passed the triennial act also known as the dissolution act in may  to which the royal assent was readily the triennial act required that parliament was to be summoned at least once every three years and that when the king failed to issue proper summons the members could assemble on their own. this act also forbade ship money without parliament's consent fines in destraint of knighthood and forced loans. monopolies were cut back severely and the courts of star chamber and court of high commission were abolished by the habeas corpus act  and the triennial act  all remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the tonnage and poundage on  may parliament decreed protestation of protestation attacking the wicked counsels of charles's whereby those who signed the petition undertook to defend the true reformed religion parliament and the king's person honour and estate. throughout may the house of commons launched several bills attacking bishops and episcopalianism in general each time defeated in the abbott charles i chapter  fall downfall of strafford and laud hoped by both charles and parliament that the execution of strafford and the protestation would end the drift towards war in fact they encouraged it. charles and his supporters continued to resent parliament's demands while parliamentarians continued to suspect charles of wanting to impose episcopalianism and unfettered royal rule by military force. within months the irish catholics fearing a resurgence of protestant power irish rebellion of first and all ireland soon descended into rumours circulated that the king supported the irish and puritan members of the commons soon started murmuring that this exemplified the fate that charles had in store for them all.see for the concerns of a similar english catholic rising. in early january  accompanied by  soldiers charles attempted to arrest five members of the house of commons on a charge of treason. this attempt failed. when the troops marched into parliament charles enquired of william lenthall the list of speakers of the house of commons of as to the whereabouts of the five. lenthall replied may it please your majesty i have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the house is pleased to direct me whose servant i am here. in other words the speaker proclaimed himself a servant of parliament rather than of the king.ref in the summer of  these national troubles helped to polarise opinion ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. opposition to charles also arose owing to many local grievances. for example the imposition of drainage-schemes in the fens negatively affected the livelihood of thousands of people after the king awarded a number of drainage many regarded the king as worse than insensitive and this played a role in bringing a large part of eastern england into parliaments camp. this sentiment brought with it people such as the edward montagu 2nd earl of of manchester and oliver cromwell each a notable wartime adversary of the king. conversely one of the leading drainage contractors the robert bertie 1st earl of of lindsey was to die fighting for the king at the battle

number of places with the first death of the conflict taking place in manchester. namewedgwood  at the outset of the conflict much of the country remained neutral though the royal navy and english cities favoured parliament while the king found considerable support in rural communities. historians estimate that between them both sides had only about  men.citation  however the war quickly spread and eventually involved every level of society. many areas attempted to remain neutral some formed bands of clubmen to protect their localities against the worst excesses of the armies of both but most found it impossible to withstand both the king and parliament. on one side the king and his supporters fought for traditional government in church and state. on the other most supporters of the parliamentary cause initially took up arms to defend what they thought of as the traditional balance of government in church and state which the bad advice the king had received from his advisers had undermined before and during the eleven years tyranny. the views of the members of parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the king  at one point during the first civil war more members of the commons and lords gathered in the king's oxford parliament parliament than at palace of  through to radicals who wanted major reforms in favour of independence and the redistribution of power at the national level.citation !--for the whole paragraph- however even the most radical supporters of the parliamentarian cause still favoured the retention of charles on the throne. after the debacle at hull charles moved on to nottingham where on  august  he raised the royal standard of when he raised his standard charles had with him about  cavalry and a small number of yorkshire infantry-men and using the archaic system of a commission of charles supporters started to build a larger army around the standard. charles moved in a south-westerly direction first to stafford and then on to shrewsbury because the support for his cause seemed particularly strong in the river valley area and in north while passing through wellington in what became known as the wellington declaration he declared that he would uphold the protestant religion the laws of england and the liberty of file:battle of marston moor battle of marston moor  the parliamentarians who opposed the king had not remained passive during this pre-war period. as in the case of kingston upon hull they had taken measures to secure strategic towns and cities by appointing men sympathetic to their cause and on  june

on  september he moved his army to coventry and then to the north of the cotswoldswegwood p.. a strategy which placed his army between the royalists and london. with the size of both armies now in the tens of thousands and only worcestershire between them it was inevitable that cavalry reconnaissance units would sooner or later meet. this happened in the first major skirmish of the civil war when a

place largely at walton-le-dale near preston in lancashire and resulted in a victory by the troops of cromwell over the royalists and scots commanded by hamilton. this parliamentarian victory marked the end of the second english civil war. nearly all the royalists who had fought in the first civil war had given their parole not to bear arms against the parliament and many honourable royalists like jacob astley 1st baron astley of astley refused to break their word by taking any part in the second war. so the victors in the second civil war showed little mercy to those who had brought war

charles abandoned montrose to his enemies. however montrose who had raised a mercenary force in norway had already landed and could not abandon the fight. he did not succeed in raising many highland clans and the covenanters defeated his army at the battle of carbisdale of carbisdale in ross-shire on  april . the victors captured montrose shortly afterwards and took him to edinburgh. on  may the

ii became the greatest threat facing the new english republic. in response to the threat cromwell left some of his lieutenants in ireland to continue the suppression of the irish royalists and returned to england.ref he arrived in scotland on  july and proceeded to lay siege to edinburgh. by the end of august disease and a shortage of supplies had reduced his army and he had to order a retreat towards his base at dunbar. a scottish army assembled under the command of david leslie scottish leslie tried to block the retreat but cromwell defeated them at the battle of dunbar of dunbar

scottish army at dunbar cromwell could not prevent charles ii from marching from scotland deep into england at the head of another royalist army. the royalists marched to the west of england because english royalist sympathies were strongest in that area but although some english royalists joined the army they came in far fewer numbers than charles and his scottish supporters had hoped. cromwell finally engaged and defeated the new king at battle of on  september . escape of charles ii escaped via safe houses and a famous royal oak tree to france ending the civil wars.ref during the wars the parliamentarians established a number of successive committees to oversee the war-effort. the first of these the english committee of of safety set up in july  comprised  members of better  following

english members continued to meet and became known as the derby house committee. a second committee of safety then replaced that committee. episcopacy during the english civil war file:william laud charles i's archbishop of canterbury. during the period of the english civil war the role of bishops as wielders of political power and as upholders of the established church became a matter of heated political controversy. john calvin formulated a doctrine of presbyterianism which held that in the new testament the offices of presbyter and episkopos were identical he rejected the doctrine of apostolic succession. calvin's follower john knox brought presbyterianism to scotland when the scottish church was reformed in . in practice presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling hierarchy. this vision of at least partial democracy in ecclesiology paralleled the struggles between parliament of and list of english king. a body within the puritan movement in the church of england sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the church of england along presbyterian lines. the martin marprelate tracts applying the pejorative name of to the church hierarchy attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended elizabeth i of i and her archbishop of canterbury john whitgift. the vestments controversy also related to this movement seeking further reductions in church ceremony and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as unedifying and even idolatry and james i of james i reacting against the perceived contumacy of his presbyterian scottish subjects adopted no bishop no king as a slogan he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as king and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his own authority. matters came to a head when king charles i of i appointed william laud as the archbishop of canterbury laud aggressively attacked the presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full book of common liturgy. the controversy eventually led to laud's impeachment for treason by a bill of attainder in  and subsequent execution. charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on scotland the scots violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the bishops wars in . during the height of puritan power in commonwealth of commonwealth and the protectorate episcopacy was formally abolished in the church of england on  october the church of england remained presbyterian until

to give a precise overall figure for those killed in battle as opposed to those who died from disease or even from a natural decline in population. figures for casualties during this period are unreliable but some attempt has been made to provide rough better  pp.   . in england a conservative estimate is that roughly  people died from war-related disease during the three civil wars. historical records count  dead from the wars themselves. counting in accidents and the two bishops wars an estimate of  dead is achieved namecarlton qwqppam p. . out of a total population of about five million. cites: figures for scotland are more unreliable and should be treated with greater caution. casualties include the deaths of prisoners-of-war in conditions that accelerated their deaths with estimates of  prisoners not surviving or not returning home  captured during and immediately after the battle of worcester were deported to new england bermuda and the west indies to work for landowners as indentured there are no figures to calculate how many died from war-related diseases but if the same ratio of disease to battle deaths from english figures is applied to the scottish figures a not unreasonable estimate of  people is achieved nameca ioidjdagwqwqppam p. . from a population of about one million.ref figures for ireland are described as miracles of conjecture. certainly the devastation inflicted on ireland was unbelievable with the best estimate provided by sir william petty the father of english demography. petty estimates that  protestants were killed through black war and famine and that  catholics were killed giving an estimated total of  dead p. . from a pre-war population of about one and a half million. although petty's figures are the best available they are still acknowledged as being tentative they do not include the estimate of  driven into exile some of whom served as soldiers in european continental armies while others were sold as indentured servants to new england and the west indies. many of those sold to landowners in new england eventually prospered but many of those sold to landowners in the west indies were worked to death. these estimates indicate that england suffered a . loss of population scotland a loss of  while ireland suffered a loss of  of its population. putting these numbers into the context of other catastrophes helps to understand the devastation to ireland in particular. the great hunger of  resulted in a loss of  of the population while during the second world war the population of the soviet

movement won its greatest successes among london's transport workers notably the thames  october  and the london transport workers in the century of revolution. self-published  rural communities seized timber and other resources on the sequestrated estates of royalists and catholics and on the estates of the royal family and the church hierarchy. some communities improved their conditions of tenure on such the old status quo began a retrenchment after the end of the first civil war in  and more especially after the restoration of monarchy in . but some gains were long-term. the democratic element introduced in the watermen's company in  for example survived with vicissitudes until the wars left england scotland and ireland among the few countries in europe without a monarch. in the wake of victory many of the ideals and many of the idealists became sidelined. the republican government of the commonwealth of england ruled england and later all of scotland and ireland from  to

convention parliament which met for the first time on  april . on  may  it declared that king charles ii had reigned as the lawful monarch since the execution of charles i in january . charles

monarchy was restored it was still only with the consent of parliament therefore the civil wars effectively set england and scotland on course to adopt a parliamentary monarchy form of this system would result in the outcome that the future kingdom of great britain formed in  under the act of union of union would manage to forestall the kind of often-bloody revolution typical of european republican movements that followed the jacobin revolution in 18th century france and the later success of napoleon which generally resulted in the total abolition of monarchy. it was no coincidence that the united kingdom was spared the wave of revolutions that occurred in europe in the 1840s. specifically future monarchs became wary of pushing parliament too hard and parliament effectively chose the line of royal succession in  with the glorious revolution and in the  act of settlement of settlement. after the english parliament's factions became political parties later becoming the and whig with competing views and varying abilities to influence the decisions of their monarchs.citation !--for the whole paragraph-- historiography and explanations of the english civil war in the early decades of the 20th century the whig school was the dominant theoretical view. they explained the civil war as resulting from a centuries-long struggle between parliament especially the house of commons and the monarchy with parliament defending the traditional rights of englishmen while the stuart monarchy continually attempted to expand its right to arbitrarily dictate law. the most important whig historian samuel rawson gardiner popularised the english civil war as a puritan revolution: challenging the repressive stuart church and preparing the way for religious toleration in the restoration. thus puritanism was the natural ally of a people preserving their traditional rights against arbitrary monarchical power. the whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the school which became popular in the 1940s, and which interpreted the english civil war as a bourgeois revolution. according to marxist historian christopher hill hill: in the 1970s, a new generation of historians who would become known as historical challenged both the whig and the marxist theories. in  a group of revisionist historians published the anthology the origins of the english civil war conrad russell ed.. these historians disliked both whig and marxist explanations of the civil war as long-term socio-economic trends in english society producing work focused on the minutiae of the years immediately preceding the civil war thereby returning to the contingency-based historiography of edward hyde 1st earl of famous contemporary history of the rebellion civil wars in england. this

puritans for example did not necessarily ally themselves with parliamentarians.citation  many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the king while many landed aristocrats supported parliament. thus revisionist historians claim to have discredited some whig and marxist interpretations of the english civil war .  jane ohlmeyer discarded and replaced the historical title english civil war with the titles the wars of the three and the british civil wars positing that the civil war in england cannot be understood isolated from events in other parts of great britain and ireland king charles i remains crucial not just as king of england but also because of his relationship with the peoples of his other realms. for example the wars began when king charles i tried imposing an anglican prayer book upon scotland and when this was met with resistance from the covenanters he needed an army to impose his will. however this forced him to call an english parliament to raise new taxes to pay for the army. the english parliaments were not willing to grant charles the revenue he needed to pay for the scottish expeditionary army unless he addressed their grievances. by the early 1640s, charles was left in a state of near permanent crisis management often he was not willing to concede enough ground to any one faction to neutralise the threat and in some circumstances to do so would only antagonise another faction. for example charles finally agreed upon terms with the covenanters in august  but although this might have weakened the position of the english parliament the irish rebellion of  broke out in october  largely negating the political advantage he had obtained by relieving himself of the cost of the scottish invasion.ohlmeyer jane. kingdoms-ht.asp civil wars of the

14	the second law of thermodynamics the entropy law or law of entropy was formulated in the middle of the last century by clausius and thomson following carnot's earlier observation that like the fall or flow of a stream that turns a mill wheel it is the fall or flow of heat from higher to lower temperatures that motivates a steam engine. the key insight was that the world is inherently active and that whenever an energy distribution is out of equilibrium a potential or thermodynamic force the gradient of a potential exists that the world acts spontaneously to dissipate or minimize. all real world change or dynamics is seen to follow or be motivated by this law. so whereas the first law expresses that which remains the same or is time symmetric in all real-world processes the second law expresses that which changes and motivates the change the fundamental time-asymmetry in all real world process. clausius coined the term entropy to refer to the dissipated potential and the second law in its most general form states that the world acts spontaneously to minimize potentials or equivalently maximize entropy and with this active end-directedness or time-asymmetry was for the first time given a universal physical basis. the balance equation of the second law expressed as s   says that in all natural processes the entropy of the world always increases and thus whereas with the first law there is no time and the past present and future are indistinguishable the second law with its one-way flow introduces the basis for telling the difference. 
14	this designation of the epistle as wisdom literature has led to a view that the author had no overriding theme that compelled him to write. more than one scholar sees the epistle as a random string of different pearls strung together with no real connection other than principles for christian living as the overall motive for composition. consider for example william barclay the daily study bible rev. ed.  vols. philadelphia: the westminster press  vol  the letters of james and peter p. . martin dibelius james revised by heinrich greeven translated by michael a. williams edited by helmet koester philadelphia: fortress press  p. simon j. kistemaker the theological message of james journal of the evangelical theological society  march : and ralph bruce terry some aspects of the discourse structure of the book of james journal of translation and text linguistics  :. however in recent times there has been consideration of an actual historical situation that led to the letter's composition. reiher argues that internal and external evidence demonstrate a violent backdrop to the epistle and the author is calling on his jewish christian readers to not let injustice and poverty so overwhelm them that they compromise the christian message of peacemaking and practical care for those in need. the letter has a recurring emphasis on identifying injustice and poverty working practically to address it but never being stained by the world in so doing. the readers are reminded to not be friends of the world not to be violent or use war and fighting coveting and killing in their response to great injustice.see: reiher jim. violent language  a clue to the historical occasion of james. evangelical quarterly. vol. lxxxv no. . july .

14	an alternative reading of the letter: there are other approaches to understanding and reading the epistle of james. a historical approach begins on different assumptions and is not content leaving the book as a loose collection of random pearls dropped in no particular order onto a piece of string.as numerous writers and commentators assume eg. william barclay the daily study bible rev. ed.  vols. philadelphia: the westminster press  vol  the letters of james and peter p. . a recent journal articlejim reiher violent language  a clue to the historical occasion of james. evangelical quarterly. vol. lxxxv no. . july  explores a violent historical background behind the epistle and offers the suggestion that it was indeed written by james the brother of jesus and written before his murder in  ad.on the death of james see josephus antiquities .. and eusebius ii..-. the decade of the 50s saw the growth of turmoil and violence in palestine as jews became more and more frustrated with corruption injustice and poverty. in continued on into the 60s and just four years after the murder of james war broke out with rome and would lead to the destruction of jerusalem and the scattering of the people. indeed the epistle of james is renown for exhortations on fighting poverty and caring for the poor in practical ways : : : : standing up for the oppressed : : and not being like the world in the way one responds to evil in the world : : : :-. worldly wisdom is rejected and we are exhorted to embrace heavenly wisdom which includes peacemaking and pursuing :-. this approach sees the epistle as a real letter numerous studies argue convincingly for a letter structure to james. see for example euan fry commentaries on james i and  peter and jude the bible translator  july :  and f.o. francis the form and function of the opening and closing paragraphs of james and i john znw  :-. with a real immediate purpose: to encourage christian jews not to revert to violence in their response to injustice and poverty but rather to stay focused on doing good staying holy and embracing the wisdom of heaven not the wisdom of the world.

14	probably the most famous single statement made in the epistle by paul is in chapter  verse : there is neither jew nor gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in christ jesus. the debate surrounding that verse is legend and the two schools of thought are  this only applies to the spiritual standing of people in the eyes of god. it does not implicate social distinctions and gender roles on earth and  this is not just about our spiritual standing but is also very much about how we relate to each other and treat each other in the here and now. position  emphasises the immediate context of the verse and notes that it is embedded in a discussion about justification: our relationship with god. position  reminds its critics that the whole letter context is very much about how people got on in the here and now together and in fact the discussion about justification came out of an actual example of people treating other people differently :ff.for an overview of the two theories see jim reiher galatians :: liberating for women or of limited application? expository times. . pp. . march . reiher comes down on the side of position . 
14	obviously non jews do not have to convert to judaism and if this was the case then no christian would have ever received the holy spirit.as this is not the case then the claim by jews that christians must convert to judaism is incorrect. equally incorrect is the statement that jews even exist as a religion when the majority of people calling themselves jews descend from esau and are not jews.jews descend from judah.those today are almost all zionists not jews. it seems to be fairly certain just by reading the epistle what the true position is. it also seems certain that god turned his back on the majority of hebrews and has to this day.jerusalem means in hebrewcapital of palestine so it is clear what has occurred over the years and the reasons behind it occurring.james non jewish

 in chronology an era is the highest level for the organisation of the measurement of time. noobs.
 its primary meaning is treated in the article on the calendar era which is the year numbering system used with a calendar referring to an established year of reference usually the often presumed start of a state religion cosmology.
 the word era is also used to denote the units used under a different more arbitrary system where time is not represented as an endless continuum with a single reference year but each unit starts counting from one again as if time starts again. such rather impractical system a nightmare for historians once a single piece of the puzzle is missing is the use of reign years which often reflects the preponderance in public life of the absolute ruler in many ancient cultures while such tradition sometimes outlives the political power of the throne.
 era was an east asian imperial practice of numbering years in an emperor's reign each being treated as a new era. it originated as a motto or slogan chosen by the emperor. different east asian countries utilized slightly different systems notably:
 chinese era eras
 japanese era eras
 korean era eras
 vietnamese era eras
 a similar practice survived in the united kingdom until quite recently but only for formal official writings: in daily life the ordinary year a.d. was used since long but acts of parliament used to be dated according to the years of the reign of the current monarch of the united so that    vict c.  refers to the local government ireland act  passed in the session of parliament of the united in the year of the reign of victoria of the united queen victoria.
 in common speech and various contexts the term era is also used by extension for any as a rule relatively long period in history with a name often relating to common characteristics even if this is not the normal way to organize time.
 the most relevant type are politic periods for example: the roman era the elizabethan era the victorian era dynastic criteria only formally correct within the british and the soviet era or comparable literary notions like the biblical era.
 the word era is also popularly used to denote the passing of often shorter periods that are only defined in terms of a specific discipline of sphere of life such as the prominence of an artistic style or more specificly in music see :category:musical eras described in history of music such as the big band era disco era. something like the death of frank sinatra is poetically called the end of an era.
  in natural science there is need for another time perspective independent from human activity and indeed spanning a far longer period mainly prehistoric as in geology where era refers to four well defined time spans covering the enire existence of the planet earth: from oldest to youngest these are the mesozoic and cenozoic eras each subdivided in shorter periods see geologic timescale for a slightly different interpretation and details.
 in astronomy the periods are even longer to cover the entire existence of the universe in the order of  billion years but usually just denoted in numerical units as there is no significant link to any earthly reality our planet being astronomically insignificant except as the only known observation point.

14	 eucharist communion iin most denominations of christianity. it is a celebration of the sacrifice of christ marked by partaking in the body of christ the bread and the blood of christ the wine.
 in the process of the the last supper jesus told his disciples do this in remembrance of me. this command was understood by the early christians as a command to recreate the last supper in a remembrance service.
 initially the remembrance service took the form of agape feasts. agape is one of the greek words for love. this service apparently was a full meal with each participant bringing their own food with the meal eaten in a common room. some echoes of this meal remain in fellowship or potluck dinners held at some churches.
 this service is known as the eucharist in traditions including eastern orthodoxy. the name eucharist is from the greek word eucharios which means thanksgiving or thank you. roman catholics typically restrict the term communion to the distribution to the commmunicants during the service of the body and blood of christ. the roman catholic belief that the priest can turn bread and wine into the body and blood of jesus christ is called transubstantiation.
 eastern orthodoxy generally refers to the entire worship service as the divine liturgy and to the specific partaking of the bread and wine as partaking of the eucharist. the liturgy typically used is the divine liturgy of st. john chrysostom on special feast days the divine liturgy of st. basil the great or of st. james may be used instead. sharing the same eucharist is a sign of unity perhaps dating back to the middle eastern tradition of only eating with friends not enemies. since it prefigures the ultimate union with god to which orthodox christians aspire the eucharist plays a central role in orthodox theology.
 ignatius of antioch called the eucharist the medicine of immortality the antidote we take in order not to die but to live forever in jesus christ. letter to the ephesians :b
 within many traditions the name communion is used. this name emphasizes the nature of the service as a joining in common between god and humans due to the sacrifice of jesus jesus.

14	the agape feast was the eucharistic celebration of the early christians. while centered on the ritual of the bread and wine it also included various other ritual elements including elements of the passover seder and of mediterranean funerary banquets also termed agape feasts. agape is one of the greek words for love particularly applied to selfless love. such meals were widespread though not universal in the early christian world. this service was apparently a full meal with each participant bringing their own food but eating in a common room. perhaps predictably enough it could at times deteriorate into merely an occasion for eating and drinking or for ostentatious displays by the wealthier members of the community. this was criticized by st. paul in the new testament cf. because of such abuses the agape gradually fell into disfavor and after being subjected to various regulations and restrictions it was definitively dropped by the church between the 6th and 8th centuries. some contemporary christians participate in agape meals on rare occasions to experience this historical form of the eucharist. many christians however after celebrating the eucharist now routinely participate in a sharing of light refreshments and conversation in an informal ritual that is functionally an agape. this post-eucharistic gathering is often called fellowship hour or coffee hour and is regarded by many clergy as a particularly opportune time for engaging adults in christian education.

14	essay by adam scott. nice try mr sharland you're going to have to do better than that. the eureka stockade in ballarat  was a crucial part of carving australians identity today. it wasnt only the first but one of the only major rebellions in australian history. many of the people involved were migrants from a wide range of overseas countries. this shaped the beginning of a multi-cultural australia. the actions of the miners at the eureka stockade shaped a new image for white australia which has stuck with us until today. this event led to the development of aspects of the typical australian character such as respecting democracy resenting authority mateship and standing up for our rights. however a negative side of the australian character was also established such as the early years of racism and the idea of the white australia policy. the eureka stockade was in fact a rebellion of the miners at the ballarat goldfields against the authority at the fields. the miners or better known as diggers consisted of mainly irish asian and european migrants but there were also large numbers from the united kingdom and north america. the goldfields in victoria were discovered in  and by  the year of the rebellion there were more than   diggers at these goldfields. the causes of the eureka stockade had a big influence on the australian identity. two main causes of rebellion were the poor living condition of the diggers and the many restrictions places on the miners by the authorities. poor living conditions included problems like injustice suffered by the miners brought on by authority of the goldfields unjust beatings and convictions of innocent miners poor hygiene and low standard of food. the biggest restriction placed on the diggers was the mining licence. they were compulsory for anyone who wanted to dig for gold legally. these licences were extremely expensive at  shillings per month. they had to be re-purchased each month and they had to be paid for even if the digger found no gold. along with these licences came the licence hunts. these were obviously searches for the mining licences to make sure all the miners were following the law. this would have been fine if not for the authority conducting these hunts in such a careless manner invading the privacy of miners and damaging belongings. needless to say miners resented the authorities and their licence hunts. along with this there were two events which led directly so the rebellion. the first of these was the arrest of a crippled non-english speaking armenian johannes gregorious was wrongly accused for the assault of a police officer. although he was an insignificant person in the goldfields thousands of miners considered him a brother as he was a fellow digger. for this reason there was an outrage in the goldfields over his arrest. the second of these events came in early october when miner james scobie was murdered just outside the local bentley hotel. the owner of the hotel ex-convict james bentley was found guilty. on  october about  miners gathered at the place of james scobies death so protest against james bentley. the crowd burnt the hotel to the ground as james bentley ran for his life. both of these events led to miners acting in very brotherly ways the beginning of australian mateship. as a result of these restrictions difficulties and events the ballarat reform league was formed in november . the meeting of about  miners past resolution that it is the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called on to obey that taxation without representation is tyranny. they made many demands including the right for all men to vote abolition of licences reform of administration on the goldfields and abolition of the property qualifications for members of parliament thus leading to the typical australian ideals of democracy and a fair go. the actual eureka stockade battle  december  was the climax of the conflict between the miners and the authorities and demonstrated all of the developing australian qualities. several days before the battle on  december about  miners gathered to protest about the recent events. they burnt their licences as a sign of independence.

14	 based on the san remo music festival the first eurovision song contest was the brainchild of the european broadcasting union. the first contest took place in  when seven of the original invitees participated the other three were disqualified for late entry. the original participants were france west germany italy the netherlands luxembourg belgium and switzerland. they were joined the next year by the united denmark and austria the procrastinators and in  by monaco.
 initially each country was allowed to submit two three-minute or less songs performed by inhabitants of the respective country. by the 1960s, entries were limited to one song per country participation in the contest had almost doubled and the songs had to be sung in the national language of the country. participation continued to grow through the 1980s, and by the turn of the century the rules had been changed several times to both limit the number of finalists and to allow for the new independent republics that arose from the former eastern bloc nations.
 current rules state that countries are only allowed to have six performers on stage and that performers must be aged  or more on the 31st of december in the year of the contest. it is worth noting that there is no restriction on the nationality of the performers.
 the eurovision song contest's name comes from the tv distribution network eurovision which is run by the european broadcasting unionebu. the song contest can be entered by any member of the ebu which includes countries such as israel which are not in europe.
 entry to the eurovision song contest also requires the country to have performed with a reasonable amount of success for the previous few years. france germany spain and the uk automatically qualify.
 the winner of the contest is decided by each country assigning points  to  to their favourite ten entries. in some countries phone polls are held during the telecast in order to decided how the country should award its points. countries are not allowed to vote for themselves.
 hosting the eurovision song contest is an honour accorded the winners of the previous year  although it means that the winners home broadcaster actually incurs heavy expenses as a result of winning and led to suggestions that some nations deliberately choose substandard acts so as to ensure they do not win. many pop singers and groups have begun the path to fame with a win at the contest perhaps most notably abba.
 the musicians and songs selected for the contest tend towards very conventional bubblegum pop and voting patterns tend to bear little resemblance to the actual quality of the music and often show more about the ethnic prejudices of various european nations than anything else. for instance english and french acts tend to do very poorly in each other's poll. turkey and greece generally snub each other. conversely turkish acts poll well in germany due to the large population of turkish expatriates there. many viewers of the contest indeed view the event as a combination of camp entertainment and a musical train wreck a fact played upon in the english language broadcast with the sardonic bbc commentary of terry wogan and a subculture of eurovision song contest drinking games and the like has evolved in some countries.

14	in  even the majority of larger states including germany opted to sing in english. the remaining exception to this is france which resolutely sings in its native tongue and defends the dual-language policy of the presentation whereby scores and points are announced in both english and french. one of the interesting tendencies in the voting patterns is that often countries will tend to vote for others in the same region notwithstanding that they may share a troubled history: croatia for example gave its maximum  points to serbia and montenegro in the  contest and the united kingdom received most of its points from ireland in the same year. this paradox pops up routinely in the voting patterns between balkan states and also amongst former soviet republics and russia the bbc's terry wogan called it keeping on terms with the big bear. the ironic flipside is that the western european states very rarely vote for others in the same region despite the fact relations between those countries are cordial at least in comparison. consequently the western european states have tended to dwell at the bottom of the voting table in recent years.

14	 euthanasia greek pleasant death means accelerating death of people on their request. this can either mean  active termination or  help in dying by either supporting suicide or not giving appropriate help in case of a suicide. either or all of this practices are illegal in most countries.
 it should be noted that doctors routinely and legally provide medical treatment to the terminally ill involving the use of large quantities of painkillers primarily to relieve the patient's pain but in doses that suppress bodily functions and thus shorten the life of the patient. however as the goal of the treatment is the relief of suffering rather than the shortening of life even if that is a known consequence doctors who oppose euthanasia argue vigorously that such treatment is not euthanasia. people who support legalisation of euthanasia find such a distinction a dubious hair splitting argument.
 proponents of euthanasia state that people should be allowed to decide that they do not want to live any more and that terminally ill patients are respected more by having their suffering end than by being kept alive against their will. philosopher peter singer has been one of the most outspoken proponents of euthanasia.
 arguments from opponents of euthanasia can be divided in two main categories. the first are objections basically saying that a person should not be free to end his or her own life. this is mainly but not only brought forward by religious people who regard one's life as a present from god that cannot be thrown away at will.
 the second type argument against euthanasia is that while the basic idea might be good it might also open the door for less desirable practices. people might be pushed to ask for euthanasia by family or doctors although they do not really want so themselves or might even be killed under the guise of euthanasia without any request from the patient. this is extra problematic when patients are unable to make any statements themselves patients that are severely mentally ill or in a persistent coma which are among the people most likely to be under consideration for euthanasia were it allowed.
 it should be noted that in about a quarter even of the medically supervised euthanasias there are complications like respiratory paralysis that make the death anything but pleasant.
 in the netherlands the upper house passed a bill for the review of cases of termination of life on request and assistance with suicide earlier approved by the lower house of parliament on  november . the bill was passed by  votes to  and is expected to take effect in the autumn of  or at the very latest in january . according to the new legislation euthanasia and assistance with suicide will continue to be criminal offences. however physicians who comply with all conditions and criteria of due care will not be prosecuted. they must practice due care as set forth in a separate law the termination of life on request and assisted suicide review act. they must also report the cause of death to the municipal coroner in accordance with the relevant provisions of the burial and cremation act. regional review committees will continue to assess whether a case of termination of life on request for assisted suicide complies with the due care criteria. depending on their findings a case will either be closed or brought to the attention of the public prosecutor. finally the legislation offers an explicit recognition of the validity of a written declaration of will of the patient regarding euthanasia.
 from the time that euthanasia first came to be widely practiced in the netherlands it was formally subject to review by boards of doctors in each hospital. the law as created basically made official what had already become unofficial law by judgments in the courts.
 euthanasia was legalised in australia's northern territory by the rights of the terminally ill act .
 this law was soon however made ineffective by the an amendment by the commonwealth government to the northern territory self-government act .
 the powers of the northern territory legislature unlike those of the state legislatures are not guaranteed by the australian constitution.
 three people had already been legally euthanasied however before the commonwealth government made this amendment.
 legislation to legalize euthanasia is now late  being discussed in the parliament.
 in the united states the most common form of euthanasia is withholding tube feeding to elderly and incapacitated patients. this is generally considered an abuse when the patient might recover. these patients die protracted deaths by dehydration.
 in the united states many opponents believe that euthanasia would be used to reduce the cost of care by health maintenance organizations. in  the largest contributors to u.s. right-to-die organizations were health maintenance organizations.
 in nazi germany the term euthanisia was a code word for systematic killing of deformed children and mentally ill adults. this has stained the word in german speaking countries. euthanisia is thus mostly paraphrased as sterbehilfe help to die in german speaking countries.

14	although it has for some time been a crime in most australian states to assist another to commit suicide prosecutions have been rare. in queensland recently  or ?? a group of relatives and friends who provided moral support to an elderly lady who committed suicide were extensively investigated by police but no charges were laid. the commonwealth government is now trying to hinder euthanasia and to further inhibit discussion of the concept by the passage of the criminal code amendment suicide related materials offences bill . that bill will probably become law an actsometime after the conservative government gains control of the senate on campaigners beware!

14	ayn rand wrote in the virtue of selfishness that since reason is mans basic means of survival that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good that which negates opposes or destroys it is the evil. this is elaborated in atlas shrugged: thinking is mans only basic virtue from which all the others proceed. and his basic vice the source of all his evils is that nameless act which all of you practice but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out the willful suspension of ones consciousness the refusal to thinknot blindness but the refusal to see not ignorance but the refusal to know. it is the act of unfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgmenton the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuse to identify it that a will not be a so long as you do not pronounce the verdict it is. 
14	others such as stefan molyneux argue that evil is a kind of moral hypocrisy where a person demands that others follow a universal moral rule but makes an arbitrary exception for himself allowing himself excuses that he would never allow others. regardless of the specific details the logical contradiction of both upholding and denying a moral rule simultaneously prove that the moral rule is invalid and cannot stand as a universal rule. 
14	 stefan molyneux by contrast holds that universal morality is a side effect of man's need for logically consistent principles to deal with a logically consistent universe  the moment a person explicitly or implicitly demands that people should behave in a certain way such as you should agree with what i am saying because it is true they are by definition making a universal statement. therefore any statements that are not truly universal if they contain logical contradictions or arbitrary exceptions are invalid.

14	the opponents of existentialism assert that it fosters the particularization of human beings stripping them of a universal sense of identity. this in turn lead writers like friedrich nietschze and leo strauss to suggest that concepts of right and wrong or good and evil were entirely arbitrary and subjective that only through the assertion of the individual will can a human being express his individual essence. existentialism's critics have suggested that these ideas helped foster the growth of fascism. 
14	existence precedes and rules essence among the most famous and influential existentialist propositions is sartre's dictum existence precedes and rules essence which is generally taken to mean that there is no pre-defined essence to humanity except that which we make for ourselves. since sartrean existentialism does not admit the existence of a god or of any other determining principle human beings are free to do as they choose. since there is no predefined human nature or ultimate evaluation beyond that which humans project onto the world people may only be judged or defined by their actions and choices and human choices are the ultimate evaluator. this concept spins from nietzsches concept of eternal return- the idea that things lose values because they cease to exist. if all things were to continually exist then they would all burden us with a tremendous level of importance but because things come to pass and no longer exist they lose their value. the concept of existence preceding essence is important because it describes the only conceivable reality as the judge of good or evil. if things simply are without directive purpose or overall truth then truth or essence is only the projection of that which is a product of existence or collective experiences. for truth to exist existence has to exist before it making it not only the predecessor but the ruler of its own objectivity.

14	molecules. another theory is the theory of inevitability of life proposed by dr v nigam of australia. according to this theory given enough time development of life is inevitable in any location. the theory os based on a different definition of life. nigam defines life as a series of self propagating self preserving and environment modifying complex chemical reactions. in any chemically active environment with random reactions eventually a reaction will develop which is self propagating. over long periods of time this reactions becomes more and more complex and develops properties of self preservation by modifying its environment with the means of natural selection. nigam also challenges the definition of an organism and says that earth may be considered as a single organism because of codependencies of various living parts. the sun or any star is a living organism according to nigams definition of life which also shows features of advance life like birth death and reproduction. 
14	further more a recent phd study brymer  showed that the link to adrenaline and true extreme sports is tentative. he refered to true extreme sports as a leisure activity where the most likely outcome of amismanaged accident or mistake was death. this definition was designed to seperate the marketing hype from the activity. the most likely outcome of non-competitive suicidal. eric brymer  also found that the potential for extraordinary human experiences many of which parallel those found in meditation wer also presented as importanat aspects of the experience. 
14	as with barry lyndon he photographed eyes wide shut using natural or source made extensive use of season. the colours red blue yellow and green feature predominantly in the film. this is enhanced by the use of christmas decorations. it is often suggested that the colour scheme is an important symbolic schemata. this theory has weight considering the four modern art posters in the hospital hallway which individually consist of these colours suggesting a consonance of location and symbolic meaning and kubrick's reputation as a master of detail. more simply it may suggest the primal or basic nature of the thematic content. shop-fronts and street signs also express a quasi-semiotic meaning in that they convey information to an observant audience that the characters are unaware of. for example before bill enters the prostitute's apartment building they stop at a store with the sign lottery perhaps indicating that he is gambling with his health. 
14	one of the recurring pieces of music in the film is the eerie second movement of gyorgy ligeti's piano cycle musica ricercata. the piece is unusual in that it uses only three notes plus octave displacements. the choice of ligeti is interesting because kubrick used ligeti's atmospheres in his film a space odyssey without obtaining ligeti's consent much to the composer's dismay.

14	the film was in production for over two years and two of the main cast members harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh had to be replaced during the course of filming. while set in new york the film was shot entirely in london england on soundstages with only a few locations. shots of manhattan itself were pick-up shots filmed in new york city by a second-unit crew. due to kubrick's secrecy about the film rumors flew about the plot and content of the film most of it highly inaccurate. most especially the film's sexual content caused a firestorm of speculation with some journalists speculating that it would be the sexiest film ever made. the participation of celebrity couple cruise and kidman did little to control the pre-release hype. critical and public response in the american public the film opened to smash box-office business which slowed down considerably in the weeks following the film's release. far from an erotic thriller eyes wide shut proved to be a slow mysterious dreamlike meditation on the themes of marriage fidelity betrayal and the illusion versus the reality of sex.
