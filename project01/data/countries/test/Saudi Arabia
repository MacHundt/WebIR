64	a douche is a plastic container a woman places the tip of into her vagina and squeezes. it has a liquid that is supposed to clean out the woman's vagina. truthfully though its not good for a vagina when someone says your a douchebag.. its just a derrogitory word. another name someone came up with to offend someone. a douchebag is filled with liquid.  i believe its basically vinegar and scented liquid some people call the name douchebag to say they are gay even though it doesnt have much of a relationship with homosexuality. if someone calls you douchebag say at least i get more puzzy than you do! then brush ya shoulders off :dthe membrane-bound molecules.lt 
64	the most advanced form of microscope having a resolving power  times or more than that of a compound microscope.in an electron mocroscope a beam of electrons under high voltage is passed through the object under observation and for making a photograph.the image is reflected on to a screen through an electronic lens.the wavelength of electron beam used is of white light.

64	 as tim bray director of web technologies at sun microsystems expressed in his keynote at oscon in july : somebody came to me and wanted to pay me a lot of money to build a large scale message handling system that really had to be up all the time could never afford to go down for years at a time i would unhesitatingly choose erlang to build it bray director of web technologies 
64	the philosophy used to develop erlang fits equally well with the development of erlang based systems. quoting mike williams one of the three inventors of erlang:  find the right methodsdesign by prototyping.  it is not good enough to have ideas you must also be able to implement them and know they work.  make mistakes on a small scale not in a production project. 
64	erlang has eight primitive data types:  integers: integers are written as sequences of decimal digits for example   and  are integers. integer arithmetic is exact and of unlimited precision. atoms: atoms are used within a program to denote distinguished values. they are written as strings of consecutive alphanumeric characters the first character being a small letter. atoms can obtain any character if they are enclosed within single quotes and an escape convention exists which allows any character to be used within an atom. floats: floating point numbers are represented as ieee    bit floating point numbers. real numbers in the range  can be represented by an erlang float. references: references are globally unique symbols whose only property is that they can be compared for equality. they are created by evaluating the erlang primitive binaries: a binary is a sequence of bytes. binaries provide a space-eecient way of storing binary data. erlang primitives exist for composing and decomposing binaries and for eecient of binaries. pids: pid is short for process identifiera pid is created by the erlang primitive codespawn pids are references to erlang processes. ports: ports are used to communicate with the external world. ports are created with the built in function bif messages can be sent to and received from ports but these message must obey the so-called port protocol. funs : funs are function closures. funs are created by expressions of the form: fun   end. and two compound data types: tuples : tuples are containers for a fixed number of erlang data types. the syntax dd dn denotes a tuple whose arguments are d d dn. the arguments can be primitive data types or compound data types. the elements of a tuple can be accessed in constant time. lists : lists are containers for a variable number of erlang data types. the syntax denotes a list whose first element is dh and whose remaining elements are the list dt. the syntax  denotes an empty list. the syntax dd..dn is short for the first element of a list can be accessed in constant time. the first element of a list is called the head of the list. the remainder of a list when its head has been removed is called the tail of the list. two forms of syntactic sugar are provided:  strings : strings are written as doubly quoted lists of characters this is syntactic sugar for a list of the integer ascii codes for the characters in the string thus for example the string cat is shorthand for .  records : records provide a convenient way for associating a tag with each of the elements in a tuple. this allows us to refer to an element of a tuple by name and not by position. a pre-compiler takes the record definition and replaces it with the appropriate tuple reference.
