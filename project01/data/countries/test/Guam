90	youngs double-slit experiment is still a topic of fascination to students and teachers alike. but what about the single-slit experiment? can we compute the entropy? now informational entropy is a measure of uncertainty. in this case it is due to the randomness associated with the decoherence of the photons. the interference results when the slit is wide enough to approximate many slits and the diffraction pattern produced is a normalized sinc squared function. so even though the location of each photon is unpredictable we can still find the entropy with shannon's formula! let math falpha x be the normalized sinc squared function where math alpha is the width of the slit it is larger than some bound. then the entropy is given by math int-inftyinfty falphaxlogfalphax dx with n slits we can find also find a formula math fnx that gives a normalized interference pattern. as math nrightarrow the patterns become sharper and the entropy approaches a minimum value.
