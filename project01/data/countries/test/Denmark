37	everything in javascript is either a primitive value or an object. objects are entities that have an identity they are only equal to themselves and that map property names to values. that is an object javascript has several kinds of built in objects namely object computer array stringmathematics and computer number boolean function date and math. other objects are host objects defined not by the language but by the runtime environment. in a browser typical host objects belong to the document object window form links etc.. by defining a constructor function it is possible to define objects. javascript is a prototype based object-oriented language. that mean that inheritance is between objects not between classes javascript has no classes. objects inherit properties from their prototypes. one can add additional properties or methods to individual objects after they have been created. to do this for all instances created by a single constructor function one can use the property of the constructor to access the prototype object. example: creating an object function myobjectattributea attributeb  create an object obj  new myobjectred  access an attribute of obj access an attribute with the associative array notation object hierarchy can be emulated in javascript. for example: derive.prototype  new base d  new derive will result in the display: a typical data structure is the array which is a map from integers to values. in javascript all objects can map from integers to values but arrays are a special type of objects that has extra behavior and methods specializing in integer indices e.g. and arrays have a property that is guaranteed to always be larger than the largest integer index used in the array. it is automatically updated if one creates a property with an even larger index. writing a smaller number to the property will remove larger indices. this property is the only special feature of arrays that distinguishes it from other objects. of arrays using normal object property access notation: these two are equivalent. its not possible to use the dot-notation strings alternative representations of number: not the same as array can use either an array literal or the constructor: ttmyarray  array with length  and  elements ttmyarray array with length  and  elements ttmyarray  new an empty array with length  ttmyarray ttmyarray elements just like any other object. the length of the will still reported as .
