35	analysis of the big winner of nobel prize --- jews jews around the world are universally recognized as a more intelligent race by many countries. although spreading in many regions and countries in the world they are outstanding to occupy the leading positions in politics economy and culture as well as arts. for a century  the number of the nobel prize winner and the proportion of its population became an absolute advantage. in the century there is a total of  people won the nobel prize jews accounted for  seats which was .. however the population of this race only occupied less than . of the global populations.   years ago in egypt the race often experienced oppression and discrimination their genes not only vitalized them with endurance and perseverance but also they will of struggle and self-motivation as well as the innate rebellious character of young people. with the character of this gene their offsprings are able to propose  of questions from routinized books. more research topics are encouraged to bring to surface the research objective can be completed by combining their endurant and rebellious gene.   years ago and after the exodus egypt jews had intermarriages in effete area. even if the parents did not agree with their children to breed in this way he she was still determined to intermarry cultivating this ethnic groups with the rebellious character and excellent tradition. they were scattered in different regions in recent hundreds of years and married the local race keeping nurturing and implementing the distant hybridization breeds good strains  how can the race be unintelligent?  focus on the cultural education and developing independent thinking and analytical skills of children when they are young.  of men and  of women are degree holders. according to my discussion of innate eugenics if newly married couples both think much before pregnancy isnt it easy to create more outstanding children with genetic mutations? even the first born would be very smart reflecting the particularity in universality of the reproductive rule. in  statistics the ratio of people receiving college or above education: hk --- . regions in mainland china ---- . then the jewish people were certainly higher than the proportion of the former. another statistics in  the world educational index:  australia was .  france was .  united states was .  britain was .  germany was .  japan was .  hong kong was .  china was .  india was . note: the index was calculated by literate ratio plus educated ratio  following the religious teachings of monogamous marriage system it is easy to give birth of children with main rule. and children born under this rule has obtained the enhanced surviving competiveness. many people inherited intelligence from parents good genes of learning.  jews advocated that birthing breeding more are fortune. that makes the number of intelligent and flexible children occupy big proportion in the entire society easing the generation of talent it is also easy for this race to have a quantitative and qualitative leap in intelligence.  children in big family with many siblings are easy to understand the survival competitions among siblings and families when they were young many children experienced harsh lives which cultivate their cherishing attitude to properties and the will of tenacious struggle. statistics and analysis of nobel prize obtained by four major countries and jews regarding three main science and technology in the twentieth century country physics chemistry biomedical total number of people total population in millions share ratio britain       .  france       .  germany       .  u.s. a     .  jews      .  source:  nobel edited by a.w. levinovitz published in  world scientific publishing company  why are jews so intelligent edited by abola central compilation and translation press in   united nations demographic yearbook-  whats behind jewish excellence? edited by japanese tejima yuro in central compilation and translation press in   illustration of analysis : ----  the number of nobel prize winners in the above table have excluded the jewish chinese japanese and indian etc. as much as possible only included the winners of local residents. the total population containing the former four countries is the statistics in  and the end of the century while only the statistics of the end of century is considered for the jews. winning share ratio is calculated by the one millionth of the average population in  for comparison.  based on the statistics of three science awards it is easy to illustrate the iq promotion.  the population of the usa is larger and hence people winning the prize are more but still cannot surpass the winning ratio of jews and britain.  on the other hand the difference of the number of winners in united states and united kingdom as well as france and germany are relatively large. implying that intermarriage between different races in britain and united states in the century has formed a large number of new human species after hybridization of different races. new human populations with intelligence and wisdom continue to expand and follow the jewish people to form a new generation of human community rapidly. traditionally germany and france are more concerned with the pure racial thinking the wisdom has a tendency of degradation.  after the second world war many western countries had their reproductive concepts changed generally advocated to breed less. britain united states germany and france were all the same. there is data showing that: the birth rate of those countries declined after the second world war but the number of winners in united states did not diminish after  while those in britain drastically declined. firstly the intelligence of the new human in general environment is more advanced than that of children born under the main rule. secondly by comparing the distant hybridization and assimilation of different races in united states with that of britain and her neighboring races in western europe there are some differences between the iq of their offsprings. this proved the words of the great biologist charles darwin: distant hybridization breeds good strains is very correct ---- the key word is the distant.  in the second half of the twentieth century the number of immigrants to united states increases dramatically lowering the winning rate of the total population but this is the prelude of cultivating the new human. in the ancient times the old grandmother of human moved from africa to the other continent it is likely that the source of the new human is generated from africa. the newly elected president of the united states obama is one of the examples from observing his certainty of being elected to clearing up the mess after three years we discovered his innate eugenics unintentionally derived from his parents. even the first born can be smart it is not necessarily to follow the basic rule in the primary stage of reproduction. genetic change and natural selection are difficult to be predicted but exploring and analyzing as well as judging are necessary the infinite potential of gene power should never be underestimated. according to the nobel prize record in  by comparing the winning ratio of nobel prize with winners born after and before the world war ii the number of winners in britain france and germany decrease obviously calculation excluding the jewish people who have won the prize. the statistics of the three types of nobel prizes winners separating in two periods of time in the following five countries during ------. - - to-- - --to-- -- country name germany       united states       jews       source: nobel why are jews so intelligent? edited by abola central compilation and translation press in  illustration and analysis of the above statistics:  the comparison is divided into two parts one is - and another is --. people bred more before world war ii and less after the war.  is when the post-war baby had grown up and received university education and worked for some time there should be a research capacity or performance demonstrated in them.  number of winners in different countries has already removed the amount of jews chinese japanese indian etc. winners in britain united states france and germany are basically offsprings of the local residents.  if comparing the last quarter of the century with the previous three quarters the number of people in britain france and germany obviously decreased it was the formation or precursor of the intelligence regression. the above three countries insisted on the theory of pure blood relationship and orthodox theory it is  times less comparing with the number of winners in united states after a quarter of the century. france was most adhering to the racial orthodox theory therefore the number of winners in the last quarter of that century was the least.  winners in jews and united states in the last quarter of the century did not decrease and the ratio even increased much. for the former race the reasons have been mentioned as above for the latter race according to the distant hybridization breeds good strains only four to five hundred years history of intermarriages in addition to the large amount of infiltrations of african people in two to three hundred years their intelligence will follow the jews and quickly catch up the ranks of new human. therefore in contrast the china's one-child policy will invoke absolute degradation of intelligence this is not simply a horrible story. are the above brief analysis of jews intelligence and the rise of new human in united states reasonable?
