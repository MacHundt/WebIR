58	historically ergonomics was another name for human factors. today ergonomics commonly refers to designing work environments for maximizing safety and efficiency. biometrics and anthropometrics play a key role in this use of the word ergonomics. engineering psychology often has a specialty dealing with workplace or occupational ergonomics. companies once thought that there was a bottom-line tradeoff between safety and efficiency. now they embrace ergonomics because they have learned that designing a safe work environment can also result in greater efficiency and productivity. recently u.s. laws requiring a safe work environment have stimulated great interest in ergonomics  from ergonomic furniture to ergonomic training. but it is in the design of the workplace as a whole where the greatest impact can be seen for both safety and efficiency. the easier it is to do a job the more likely it is to see gains in productivity due to greater efficiency. analogously the safer it is to do a job the more likely it is to see gains in productivity due to reduced time off for injury. ergonomics can address both of these issues concurrently by maximizing the workspace and equipment needed to do a job.
