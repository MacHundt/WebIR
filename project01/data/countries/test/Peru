81	:mathmboxreduction: mboxh spontaneous redox reactions produces electricity thus passage of electrons through a wire in the electric circuit. electrolysis requires an external source of electrical energy to induce a chemical reaction this process takes place in a compartment called electrolytic cell. principles involved on electrolysis are the same as featured on electrochemical cells. electrolysis of molten sodium chloride !- image with unknown copyright status removed: image:downs sodium cell diagram. - when molten sodium chloride can be electrolysed to yield metallic sodium and gaseous chlorine. industrially this process takes place in a special cell named down's cell. the cell is connected to a battery allowing electrons to from the battery to the electrolytic cell. reactions that take place at down's cell are the following: :mathmboxanode oxidation: cl rightarrow clg  :mathmboxcathode reduction: nal  e rightarrow :mathmboxoverall reaction: na  cl-l rightarrow nal  this process can yield industrial amounts of metallic sodium and gaseous chlorine and is widely used on mineral dressing and metallurgy standard emf for this process is approximately  v indicating a non spontaneous process. in order this reaction to occur the battery should provide at least a potential of v. however on mineral refining industry higher voltages are used due to low efficiency on the process. image:hoffman of a hofmann voltameter showing electrolysis of water. water at standard temperature and pressure conditions doesn't decompose into hydrogen and oxygen spontaneous as the gibbs free energy for the process at standard conditions is about . kj however special laboratory glassware has been designed for this purpose the hofmann voltameter. in it a pair of inert electrodes usually made of platinum act as anode and cathode in the electrolytic process. after the water if pure has been placed in the apparatus nothing happens hence there are not enough ions to let the passage of electrons occur. to start the electrolysis an electrolyte should be placed in usually sodium chloride or sulfuric acid most used . molar bubbles from the gases will be seen near both electrodes. the following half reactions describe the process mentioned above: :mathmboxanode oxidation: hol rightarrow og  haq  :mathmboxcathode reduction: hog  e rightarrow hg  :mathmboxoverall reaction: hol rightarrow hg  although strong acids may be used in the apparatus the reaction will not net consume the acid. electrolysis of aqueous solutions electrolysis in an aqueous is a similar process as mentioned in electrolysis of water. however it is considered to be a complex process because the contents in solution have to be analyzed in chemical reactions whether reduced or oxidized. the presence of water in a solution of sodium chloride must be examined in respect to its reduction and oxidation in both electrodes. usually water is electrolysed as mentioned in electrolysis of water yielding gaseous oxygen in the anode and gaseous hydrogen in the cathode. on the other hand sodium chloride in water dissociation in na and cl ions anion will be attracted to the cathode thus reducing the sodium ion. the cation will then be attracted to the anode oxidizing chloride ion. the following half reactions describes the process mentioned: :mathmbox. cathode: naaq e rightarrow nas qquad eored-. :mathmbox. anode: cl-aq rightarrow clg  e qquad eored . :mathmbox. cathode: hol  e rightarrow hg  oh-aqqquad eored-. :mathmbox. anode:  hol rightarrow og  haq  e-qquad reaction  is discarded as it has the most negative and non-negative value on standard reduction potential thus making it less thermodynamically favorable in the process. when comparing the reduction potentials in reactions    the reduction of chloride ion is favored. thus if the cl ion is favored for then the water reaction is favored for oxidation producing gaseous oxygen however experiments shown gaseous chlorine is produced and not oxygen. although the initial analysis is correct there is another effect that can happen known as the effect. additional voltage is sometimes required beyond the voltage predicted by the this may be due to chemical rather than considerations. in fact it has been proven that the activation energy for the chloride ion is very low hence favorable in chemical terms. in other words although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis the rate is so slow that to make the process proceed in a reasonable time frame the voltage of the external source has to be increased hence overvoltage. finally reaction  is favorable because it describes the proliferation of ions thus letting a probable reduction of ions less favorable an option. the overall reaction for the process according to the analysis would be the following: :mathmboxanode oxidation:  cl-aqrightarrow clg  :mathmboxcathode reduction:  hol  e-rightarrow hg  :mathmboxoverall reaction:  ho  cl-aq rightarrow hg  clg  as the overall reaction indicates the concentration of chloride ions is reduced in comparison to oh ions whose concentration increases. the reaction also shows the production of gaseous hydrogen chlorine and aqueous sodium hydroxide. quantitative electrolysis  faraday laws law of electrolysis quantitative aspects of electrolysis were originally developed by michael faraday in . faraday is also credited to have coined the terms electrolyte electrolysis among many others while he studied quantitative analysis of electrochemical reactions. also he was an advocate of the law of conservation of energy. metals a process named electroplating is used diagram shows nickel refining the process has its bases on the first and the second law of electrolysis stated by faraday in the 19th century. faraday concluded after several experiments on electrical current in spontaneous process the mass of the products yielded on the electrodes was proportional to the value of current supplied to the cell the length of time the current existed and the molar mass of the substance analyzed. in other words the amount of a substance deposited on each electrode of an electrolytic cell is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the cell. below a simplified equation of faraday's first law: :mathm    over  mathrmc  cdot  q m over n  :m is the mass of the substance produced at the electrode in grams :q is the total electric charge that passed through the solution in coulombs :n is the valence number of the substance as an ion in solution electrons per ion :m is the molar mass of the substance in grams per mole faraday devised the laws of chemical electrodeposition of metals from solutions in . he formulated the second law of electrolysis stating the amounts of bodies which are equivalent to each other in their ordinary chemical action have equal quantities of electricity naturally associated with them. in other terms the quantities of different elements deposited by a given amount of electricity are in the ratio of their chemical equivalent weights. an important aspect of the second law of electrolysis is electroplating which together with the first law of electrolysis has a significant number of applications in the industry as when used to protect metals to avoid corrosion. title

81	electrochemical reactions in water are better understood by balancing redox reactions using the ion-electron method where  ion water and electrons to compensate the oxidation changes are added to cell's half reactions for oxidation and reduction. in acid medium ions and water are added to half reactions to balance the overall reaction. for example when manganese reacts with sodium bismuthate. :mathmboxoxidation:  finally the reaction is balanced by the number of electrons from the reduction half reaction to oxidation half reaction and vice versa and adding both half reactions thus solving the equation. in basic medium ions and water are added to half reactions to balance the overall reaction. for example on reaction between potassium permanganate and sodium sulfite. the same procedure as followed on acid medium by multiplying electrons to opposite half reactions solve the equation thus balancing the overall reaction. the same procedure as used on acid medium is applied for example on balancing using electron ion method to combustion of propane gas. :mathmboxreduction: mboxh  mboxo as in acid and basic medium electrons which were used to compensate oxidation changes are multiplied to opposite half reactions thus solving the equation.
