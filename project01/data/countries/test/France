38	by john st clair akwei from an article in nexus magazine  a lawsuit filed against the u.s. national security agency reveals a frightening array of technologies and programs designed to keep tabs on individuals. john st clair akwei ft george g. meade md usa the following document comprises evidence for a lawsuit filed at the u.s. courthouse in washington dc by john st clair akwei against the national security agency ft george g. meade maryland civil action  constitutes his knowledge of the nsa's structure national security activities proprietary technologies and covert operations to monitor individual citizens ed. . the nsa's mission and domestic intelligence operation blanket coverage of all electronic communications in the us and the world to ensure national security. the nsa at ft meade maryland has had the most advanced computers in the world since the early 1960s. nsa technology is developed and implemented in secret from private corporations academia and the general public. the signals intelligence mission of the nsa has evolved into a program of decoding emf waves in the environment for wirelessly tapping into computers and track persons with the electrical currents in their bodies. signals intelligence is based on fact that everything in the environment with an electric current in it has a magnetic flux around it which gives off emf waves. the department of defense developed proprietary advanced digital equipment which can remotely analyze all objects whether manmade or organic that have electrical activity. the nsa has records on all us citizens. the nsa gathers information on us citizen who might be of interest to any of the over  nsa agents humint. these agents are authorized by executive order to spy on anyone. the nsa has a permanent national security anti-terrorist surveillance network in place. this surveillance network is completely disguised and hidden from the public. tracking individuals in the us is easily and cost-effectively implemented with nsa's electronic surveillance network. this network domint covers the entire us involves tens of thousands of nsa personnel and tracks millions of persons simultaneously . cost-effective implementation of operations is assured by nsa computer technology designed to minimize operations costs. nsa personnel serve in quasi-public positions in their communities and run cover businesses and legitimate businesses that can inform the intelligence community of persons they would want to track. nsa personnel in the community usually have cover identities such as social workers lawyers and business owners. individual citizens occasionally targeted for surveillance by independently operating nsa personnel nsa personnel can control the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals in the us by using the nsa's domestic intelligence network and cover businesses. the operations independently run by them can sometimes go beyond the bounds of law. long-term control and sabotage of tens of thousands of unwitting citizens by nsa operatives is likely to happen. nsa domint has the ability to assassinate us citizens covertly or run covert psychological control operations to cause subjects to be diagnosed with ill mental health. the above symptoms highlight a fraction of the vast array of neuro-electromagnetic frequency assaults perpetuated by the police and military intelligence agencies toward remote mind control experiments behavioral manipulation and murder. . nsa's domestic electronic surveillance network as of the early 1960s, the most advanced computers in the world were at the nsa ft meade. research breakthroughs with these computers were kept for the nsa. at the present time the nsa has nanotechnology computers that are  years ahead of present computer technology. the nsa obtains blanket coverage of information in the us by using advanced computers that use artificial intelligence to screen all communications regardless of medium for key words that should be brought to the attention of nsa these computers monitor all communications at the transmitting and receiving ends. this blanket coverage of the us is a result of the nsa's signals intelligence sigint mission. the nsa's electronic surveillance network is based on a cellular arrangement of devices that can monitor the entire emf electromagnetic frequency spectrum. this equipment was developed implemented and kept secret in the same manner as other electronic warfare programs. signals intelligence remote computer tampering the nsa keeps track of all pcs and other computers sold in the us. this is an integral part of the domestic intelligence network. the nsa's emf equipment can tune in rf remote frequency emissions from personal computer circuit boards while filtering out emissions from monitors and power sup plies. the rf emission from pc circuit boards contains digital information in the pc. coded rf waves from the nsa's equipment can resonate pc circuits and change data in the pcs. thus the nsa can gain wireless modem-style entry into any computer in the country for surveillance or anti-terrorist electronic warfare. detecting emf fields in humans for surveillance a subject's bioelectric field can be remotely detected so subjects can be monitored anywhere they are. with special emf equipment nsa cryptologists can remotely read evoked potentials from eegs. these can be decoded into a person's brain-states and thoughts. the subject is then perfectly monitored from a distance. nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals intelligence emf scanning network and the nsa's computers will then pinpoint and track that person  hours a day. the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the us. . nsa signals intelligence use of emf brain stimulation nsa signals intelligence uses emf brain stimulation for remote neural monitoring rnm and electronic brain link ebl. emf brain stimulation has been in development since the mkultra program of the early 1950s, which included neurological research into radiation non-ionizing emf and bioelectric research and development. the resulting secret technology is categorized at the national security archives as radiation intelligence defined as information from unintentionally emanated electromagnetic waves in the environment not including radioactivity or nuclear detonation. signals intelligence implemented and kept this technology secret in the same manner as other electronic warfare programs of the us government. the nsa monitors available information about this technology and withholds scientific research from the public. there are also international intelligence agreements to keep this technology secret. the nsa has proprietary electronic equipment that analyze electrical activity in humans from a distance. nsa computer generated brain mapping can continuously monitor all of the electrical activity in the brain continuously. the nsa records and decode individual brain maps of hundreds of thousands of persons for national security purposes. emf brain stimulation is also secretly used by the military for brain-to-computer link in military fighter aircraft for example. for electronic surveillance purposes electrical activity in the speech center of the brain can be translated into the subject's verbal thoughts. rnm can send encoded signals to the brain's auditory cortex thus allowing audio communications direct to the brain bypassing the ears. nsa operatives can use this covertly to debilitate subjects by simulating auditory hallucinations characteristic of paranoid schizophrenia. without any contact with the subject remote neural monitoring can map out electrical activity from the visual cortex of a subject's brain and show images from the subject's brain on a video monitor. nsa operatives see what the surveillance subject's eyes are seeing. visual memory can also be seen. rnm can send images direct to the visual cortex bypassing the eyes and optic nerves. nsa operatives can use this surreptitiously to put images into a surveillance subject's brain while they are in rem sleep for brain-programming purposes. capabilities of nsa operatives using rnm there has been a signals intelligence network in the us since the 1940s. the nsa ft meade has in place a vast two-way wireless rnm system which is used to track subjects and non-invasively monitor audio-visual information in their brains. this is all done with no physical contact with the subject. rnm is the ultimate method of surveillance and domestic intelligence. speech d sound and subliminal audio can be sent to the auditory cortex of the subject's brain bypassing the ears and images can be sent into the visual cortex. rnm can alter a subject's perceptions moods and motor control. speech cortex link has become the ultimate communications system for the intelligence community. rnm allows for a complete audio-visual brain-to-brain link or brain-to-computer link. the above is a simple flowchart of nuero-electromagnetic frequency assaults showing methods that can be perpetuated by the police and military intelligence agencies toward remote mind control experiments behavioural manipulation and murder. . national security agency signals intelligence electronic brain link technology nsa sigint can remotely detect identify and monitor a person's bioelectric fields. the nsa's signals intelligence has the proprietary ability to monitor remotely and non-invasively information in the human brain by digitally decoding the evoked potentials in the  hz  milliwatt electromagnetic emissions from the brain. neuronal activity in the brain creates a shifting electrical pattern that has a shifting magnetic flux. this magnetic flux puts out a constant  hz  milliwatt electromagnetic emf wave. contained in the electromagnetic emission from the brain are spikes and patterns called evoked potentials. every thought reaction motor command auditory event and visual image in the brain has a corresponding evoked potential or set of evoked potentials. the emf emission from the brain can be decoded into the current thoughts images and sounds in the subject's brain. nsa sigint uses emf-transmitted brain stimulation as a communications system to transmit information as well as nervous system messages to intelligence agents and also to transmit to the brains of covert operations subjects on a non-perceptible level. emf brain stimulation works by sending a complexly coded and pulsed electromagnetic signal to trigger evoked potentials events in the brain thereby forming sound and visual images in the brain's neural circuits. emf brain stimulation can also change a person's brain-states and affect motor control. two-way electronic brain link is done by remotely monitoring neural audio visual information while transmitting sound to the auditory cortex bypassing the ears and transmitting faint images to the visual cortex bypassing the optic nerves and eyes. the images appear as floating d screens in the brain. two-way electronic brain link has become the ultimate communications system for personnel. remote neural monitoring rnm remotely monitoring bioelectric information in the human brain has become the ultimate surveillance system. it is used by a limited number of agents in the us intelligence community. the above is a simple flowchart of nuero-electromagnetic frequency assaults showing methods that can be perpetuated by the police and military intelligence agencies toward remote mind control experiments behavioral manipulation and murder. . no heading in original document rnm requires decoding the resonance frequency of each specific brain area. that frequency is then modulated in order to impose information in that specific brain area. the frequency to which the various brain areas respond varies from  hz to  hz. only nsa signals intelligence modulates signals in this frequency band. see table  below this modulated information can be put into the brain at varying intensities from subliminal to perceptible. each person's brain has a unique set of bioelectric frequencies. sending audio information to a person's brain at the frequency of another person's auditory cortex would result in that audio information not being perceived. the plaintiff learned of rnm by being in two-way rnm contact with the kinnecome group at the nsa ft meade. they used rnm d sound direct to the brain to harass the plaintiff from october  to may . as of they have had two-way rnm communications with the plaintiff and have used rnm to attempt to incapacitate the plaintiff and hinder the plaintiff from going to the authorities about their activities against the plaintiff in the last  years. the kinnecome group has about  persons working  hours a day at ft meade. they have also brain-tapped persons the plaintiff is in contact with to keep the plaintiff isolated. this is the first time ever that a private citizen has been harassed with rnm and has been able to bring a lawsuit against nsa personnel misusing this intelligence operations method. . nsa techniques and resources remote of individuals in any location inside any building continuously anywhere in the country. a system for inexpensive implementation of these operations allows for thousands of persons in every community to be spied on constantly by the nsa. nsa's rnm equipment remotely reads the evoked potentials eegs of the human brain for tracking individuals and can send messages through the nervous systems to affect their performance. rnm can electronically identify individuals and track them anywhere in the us. this equipment is on a network and is used for domestic intelligence operations government security and military base security and in case of bioelectric warfare. spotters and walk-bys in metropolitan areas tens of thousands of persons in each area working as spotters and place spies sometimes unwittingly following and checking on subjects who have been identified for covert control by nsa personnel. agents working out of offices can be in constant communication with spotters who are keeping track of the nsa's thousands of subjects in public. nsa agents in remote offices can instantly identify using rnm any individual spotted in public who is in contact with surveillance subject. chemicals and drugs into residential buildings with hidden nsa installed and maintained plastic plumbing lines. the nsa has kits for running lines into residential tap water and air ducts of subjects for the delivery of drugs such as sleeping gas or brainwashing aiding drugs. this is an outgrowth of cia pharmapsychology psychopharmacology. brief overview of proprietary us equipment mentioned fixed network of special emf equipment that can read eegs in human brains and individuals by using digital computers. esb electrical stimulation to the brain via emf signal from the nsa signals intelligence is used to control subjects. emf equipment that gathers information from pc circuit boards by deciphering rf emissions thereby gaining wireless modem-style entry into any personal computer in the country. all equipment hidden all technology secret all scientific research unreported as in electronic warfare research. not known to the public at all yet complete and thorough implementation of this method of domestic intelligence has been in place since the early 1980s. i tried ringing mr akwei to find out what was the out-come if any of his court case. he firmly but kindly told me that he could not speak about anything to do with the case over the phone and hung up. a subsequent conversation of similar length resulted in the information that he did not wish his address or phone number published with this article. so if we hear of any developments we'll let you know. its totally obvious from the above article that the us national security agency is none other than a covertly run terrorist organization. their highly sophisticated technology that is used to monitor and manipulate the minds of millions of innocent people daily is a blatant expression of the dominating and authoritarian mentality that exists behind the facade of our so called democratic society. george orwell's thought police is an absolute reality in today's world. whether we realize it or not every individual within our society is negatively effected by this dictatorship attitude. it has to change  it will change  it starts with you! an example of emf brain stimulation information induced through modulation sound which bypasses the ears these publications have only been discovered since december  after plaintiff had already notified authorities dept of justice etc. of public corruption by named nsa employees. when no action was taken against the nsa employees i researched the intelligence community

38	01st june looked for the nearest object  an iron and ripped it from its plug and struck trevor with it repeatedly. little mo however wasn't the only slater sister with trouble. zoe was planning to leave london to go and work with her uncle harry in spain. but kat was dead against the idea much to zoe's disgust. it was then revealed that kat was zoe's mother and uncle harry was the father who had regularly been having sex with a teenage kat. viv kat's mother knew the truth but charlie was kept in the dark  they raised zoe as their own. the woman zoe had called her mum was really her nan her sister was her mum and her uncle was her great uncle and her father! zoe fled the square and kat slashed her wrists. after little mo had hit trevor it later turned out he was not dead as first expected he had infact got and left when she returned to the house with her sisters. trevor went to the police on the account little mo attempted to murder him. little mo kept quiet about the rape and trevor gave a good account of what had happened on that night. little mo took the stand and told the court about the hell she had gone through with her abusive spouse however the jury were unmoved and little mo was sent down for eight years. kat later managed to track down donna trevors other woman and persuaded her to testify against trevor. mo was released later on in the summer after trevor was caught red handed trying to get to donna by the police. on halloween of this year trevor was back  he kidnapped little mo and baby sean and daubed the slater house in petrol  little mo ended up dropping the match which set the house on fire. fireman tom saved little mo from the house and then went back for trevor  only for the house to go up flames  both of them died. phil mel steve lisa and mark were all beginning to strain. phil had slept with mel  steve's wife at the end of . he also wanted custody of baby louise who lisa the mother had pretended mark fowler was the father. it all ended when steve and mel planned to leave walford forever  steve wanted lisa to come to get back at phil who would lose his daughter. but it was all delayed when mark couldn't go because of his hiv. steve had baby louise in his car as he is furiously chased by phil mitchell which results in steve crashing the car. phil saved baby louise but steve was stuck in the buring wreck of the car which blew up before phil had time to go back. lisa married mark but then decided to begin an affair with phil again. mel discovered she didn't own the e steve had sold it to beppe before he died and was then arrested for drud dealing. mel discovered she was carrying steve's baby. lisa confessed to her best friend mel that she actually shot phil  not her deceased husband steve as she had thought. this resulted in mel leaving the square and starting again abroad. sonia and jamie had been an on and off relationship ethel had told them before she died that she could feel they were meant to be together and even gave them her wedding ring. they came together again when jamie was beaten up by phil and they decided they would marry. he had pawned the ring ethel had given them to start up a business much to the annoyance of sonia. just as he got the ring back  he was run over by martin fowler and later died in hospital in a christmas day episode. for the past  years has remained at the center of bbcs primetime schedule. there are four episodes per week five including the omnibus on british television. these are the following dates and times: monday : pm tuesday at : pm thursday at : pm friday at : pm and the omnibus on sunday at : pm. originally eastenders was shown twice weekly this then increased to thrice after coronation street added an extra episode  in response to competition from eastenders. eastenders then added its fourth episode shown on friday's on august 10th . this caused some controvesy as it clashed with coronation street which at the time was moved to .pm to make way for an hour long episode of rural soap emmerdale at .pm. the move immediately provoked an angry response from itv insiders who argued that the bbc's last minute move  only revealed at .pm on the day  broke an unwritten scheduling rule that the two flagship soaps would not be put directly against each other. in this first head-to-head battle eastenders claimed victory over its rival. in  eastenders revealed was launched choice now bbc the show takes a look behind the scenes of the show and investigates particular places characters or families within eastenders. eastenders revealed is the only bbc choice programme to last the entire life of the channel and is still running on bbc. in early   viewers could watch episodes of eastenders on digital channel bbc before they were broadcast on bbc. this was to coincide with the relaunch of the channel and helped bbc break the one million viewers for the first time with million who watched to see mark fowler's departure. pm and can often be seen citenews titleaxe falls on eastenders boss dateseptember   orgmediaguardian  citenews titlebbc breaks down the barriers datefebruary   orgmediaguardian  bbc: eastenders official site  book reference authorsmith rupert titleeastenders:  years in albert square publisherbbc books bbc worldwide ltd year idisbn

38	an eclipse involving the sun earth and moon can occur only when they are nearly in a straight line. because the orbit of the plane of the moon is tilted with respect to the orbital plane of the earth the ecliptic eclipses can occur only when the moon is close to the intersection of these two planes the node the sun earth and nodes are aligned twice a year and eclipses can occur during a period of about two month around these times. there can be from four to seven eclipses in a calendar year which repeat according to various eclipse cycles such as the saros cycle. progression of a lunar eclipse during a solar eclipse the moon can sometimes perfectly cover the sun because its apparent size is nearly the same as the sun when viewed from the earth. this was not the case  million years ago when the moon was closer to the earth and it will cease to be the case in the distant future. a solar eclipse is actually a misnomer the phenomenon is more correctly described as an occultation. lunar eclipses occur when the moon passess through the earth's shadow. there are three types of lunar eclipses: penumbral when the moon crosses only the earth's penumbra partial when the moon crosses partially into the earth's umbra and total when the moon crosses entirely within the earth's umbra. of deimos from of phobos from of phobos on mars on mars only partial eclipses are possible because neither of its moons is large enough to cover the sun's disc as seen from the surface of the planet. martian eclipses have been photographed from both the surface of mars and from orbit.

38	 the epistle to the romans is one of the epistles or letters included in the new testament canon.
 it was probably written at corinth. phoebe rom. :
 of cenchrea conveyed it to rome and gaius of corinth
 entertained the apostle paul at the time of his writing it : 
 cor. : and erastus was chamberlain of the city i.e. of
 corinth  tim. :.
 the precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in
 the epistle but it was obviously written when the apostle was
 about to go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints i.e.
 at the close of his second visit to greece during the winter
 preceding his last visit to that city rom. : comp. acts
 : :    cor. : early in a.d. .
 it is highly probable that christianity was planted in rome by
 some of those who had been at jerusalem on the day of pentecost
 acts :. at this time the jews were very numerous in rome
 and their synagogues were probably resorted to by romans also
 who in this way became acquainted with the great facts regarding
 jesus as these were reported among the jews. thus a church
 composed of both jews and gentiles was formed at rome. many of
 the brethren went out to meet paul on his approach to rome.
 there are evidences that christians were then in rome in
 considerable numbers and had probably more than one place of
 meeting rom. : .
 the object of the apostle in writing to this church was to
 explain to them the great doctrines of the gospel. his epistle
 was a word in season. himself deeply impressed with a sense of
 the value of the doctrines of salvation he opens up in a clear
 and connected form the whole system of the gospel in its
 relation both to jew and gentile. this epistle is peculiar in
 this that it is a systematic exposition of the gospel of
 universal application. the subject is here treated
 argumentatively and is a plea for gentiles addressed to jews.
 in the epistle to galatians the same subject is discussed
 but there the apostle pleads his own authority because the
 church in galatia had been founded by him.
 after the introduction : the apostle presents in it
 divers aspects and relations the doctrine of justification by
 faith :-: on the ground of the imputed righteousness of
 christ. he shows that salvation is all of grace and only of

38	 eurocard is a european standard format for printed circuit cards which can be plugged together into a standardized chassis. the chassis consists of a series of slots on the top and bottom into which the cards are slid so they stand on end like books on a shelf. at the back of each card is one or more din  or other din connectors which plug into similar connectors on a backplane at the rear of the chassis.
 eurocards have standardized sizes based on the u for unit.  u is .mm and cards come in various multiples of this size. a u eurocard is mm x mm with one din connector on the short edge. a double or u eurocard is mm x mm with one or two din connectors on the long edge. a triple or u eurocard is also defined but not often used.
 eurocard does not define the signals or the meanings of the pins in the din connectors this is left up to the individual implementation to provide. several systems have used the eurocard standard mechanicals as the basis for a complete bus system including vmebus vxibus and compactpci. there are also innumerable one-off applications.
 the measurements have also been used to define the inch rack standard although in a roundabout way. in this case the u's measure the vertical height of the equipment with the width and depth being that of a u card. for instance a u card is mm high by x.

38	euthanasia was legalized in australia's northern territory by the rights of the terminally ill act of the terminally ill act . however this law was soon made ineffective by an amendment by the commonwealth to the northern territory self-government act . the powers of the northern territory legislature unlike those of the state legislatures are not guaranteed by the australian constitution. four people had already been legally euthanised however before the commonwealth government made this amendment. although it has for some time been a crime in most australian states to assist another to commit suicide prosecutions have been rare. in queensland recently  or ?? a group of relatives and friends who provided moral support to an elderly lady who committed suicide were extensively investigated by police but no charges were laid. the commonwealth government is now trying to hinder euthanasia and to further inhibit discussion of the concept by the passage of the criminal code amendment suicide related materials offences bill . that bill will probably become law an act sometime after the conservative government gains control of the senate on july  . after an extensive discussion the parliament legalised euthanasia in late september . the new legislation however institutes a complicated process which has been criticized as an attempt to establish a bureaucracy of death. nevertheless euthanasia is now legal and its proponents in the country hope that it will stop many illegal practices it is said that several thousand illegal acts of euthanasia have been carried out in belgium each year. on january   marcel tremblay of kanata ontario held a press conference to announce plans to kill himself saying his life with pulmonary fibrosis was unbearable. after attending his own living wake the year old man committed suicide at pm eastern suicide-.html he had previously said he would be surrounded by his wife and adult children while he placed a bag over his head and filled it with helium. tremblay said that he publicized his suicide plans help change laws over assisted suicide. his lawyer said police were satisfied that tremblay had a sound mind and that authorities would not intervene. canada decriminalized committing suicide and attempting to commit suicide in . in the early 1990s, year-old sue rodriguez who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als or lou gehrig's disease fought to overturn the law against assisted suicide. she lost her court battle but died by assisted suicide with the help of an anonymous doctor. under canada's criminal code assisted suicide is illegal and punishable by up to  years in prison. in the netherlands the termination of on request and assisted suicide review procedures act took effect on april  . it legalizes euthanasia and physician assisted suicide in certain circumstances. the law recognized a practice that had been tolerated for some  years. from the time that euthanasia first came to be widely practiced in the netherlands it was formally subject to review by boards of doctors in each hospital. the law essentially codified what had already become tolerated practice and unofficial law by judgments in the courts. the law permits euthanasia and physician assisted suicide when each of the following conditions is fulfilled: the patient has asked repeatedly the patient's suffering is unbearable with no prospect of improvement the doctor has prior to the act consulted an independant colleague. the patient has to be at least  years old patients between  and  years of age require consent of their parents the doctor must also report the cause of death to the municipal coroner in accordance with the relevant provisions of the burial and cremation act. a regional review committee assesses whether a case of termination of life on request or assisted suicide complies with the due care criteria. depending on its findings the case will either be closed or brought to the attention of the public prosecutor. finally the legislation offers an explicit recognition of the validity of living written declaration of will of the patient regarding euthanasia a euthanasia directive. such declarations can be used when a patient is in coma or otherwise unable to state whether they want euthanasia or not. the legislation has wide support among the socially libertarian dutch who have one of the world's highest life expectancies. there is however persistent opposition mainly organized by the churches. euthanasia remains a criminal offense in cases not meeting the law's specific conditions with the exception of several situations that are not subject to the restrictions of the law at all because they are considered normal medical practice: stopping or not starting a medically useless treatment stopping or not starting a treatment at the patient's request speeding up death as side-effect of treatment necessary for alleviating serious suffering euthanasia of children under the age of  remains technically illegal however dr. eduard verhagen has documented several cases and together with colleagues and prosecutors has developed a protocol to be followed in those cases. prosecutors will refrain from pressing charges if groningen protocol followed. in  in the netherlands  cases were officially reported of euthanasia in the sense of a physician causing death .  of all deaths. usually the sedative sodium thiopental is intravenously administered to induce a coma and after making sure the patient is in a deep coma typically after some minutes a muscle relaxant is administered to stop the breathing and cause death. :officially reported were also  cases of physician assisted suicide .  of all deaths usually by drinking a strong barbiturate potion. the doctor is required to be present for two reasons: to make sure the potion is not taken by a different person by accident or theoretically for unauthorized suicide or perhaps even murder to monitor the process and be available to apply the combined procedure mentioned below if necessary. in two cases the doctor was reprimanded for not being present while the patient drank the potion. they did not realize that this is required. forty-one cases were reported to combine the two procedures: usually in these cases the patient drinks the potion but this does not cause death. after a few hours or earlier in the case of vomiting the muscle relaxant is administered to cause death. by far most reported cases concerned cancer patients. also in most cases the procedure was applied at home. note that some medical authorities and investigative reporters claim substantial numbers of euthanasias in the netherlands performed without consultation or official notice  see links below. in contrast to the rest of the united states the state of oregon has legalized physician-assisted suicide but not euthanasia: a physician or anyone else may not directly kill. residents have voted for it at the oregon ballot measure   and voted against repealing it at the oregon ballot measure  !- what on earth does the sentence just preceding mean?--. oregon's law has been attacked by various organizations and federal government parties that support those organizations ever since it was first enacted !--various organizations? this is a meaningless sentence--. former united states attorney general john ashcroft a longtime opponent of assisted suicide maintains that oregon's law violates the controlled substances act because the prescriptions do not have a legitimate medical purpose and proposes that physicians who prescribe controlled substances to assist with suicides should have their medical licenses revoked. the issue of whether the federal government or the state of oregon has jurisdiction over this issue is now before the united states supreme court. in  in oregon  cases of physician assisted suicide were reported .  of deaths all by drinking a strong barbiturate potion. the doctor is not required to be present in  cases was. since   oregonians have relied on the assisted suicide law. there were three cases of regurgitation. in each case at least one third of the potion was retained which caused death anyway though in one case only after  hours. the time from ingestion to unconsciousness was  to  minutes median  minutes the time from ingestion to death  minutes to  hours median  minutes. by far most reported cases concerned cancer patients. also in most cases the procedure was applied at home. a controversial case is that of terri schiavo and the legislation inspired by her in florida under governor jeb bush. in  schiavo collapsed in her home of an eating disorder. she spent the next  years on a feeding tube in the local hospice center. her husband fought to have the feeding tube removed but her parents fought to have it stay. in march of  the feeding tube was removed. two weeks later on april   schiavo died of starvation. consider the death a murder.

38	 john tooby and leda cosmides coined the term evolutionary psychology ep in their  book the adapted mind: evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture as a way to examine the functions of the mind in terms of adaptation. they believe that many aspects of human behavior and other cognitive processes can be better understood by determining how different behaviors might have evolved over human history. the main sources of evolutionary psychology are : cognitive psychology genetics ethology anthropology evolutionary biology zoology etc.
 some scientists see this as no different from e. o. wilson's sociobiology as described in the  sociobiology: the new synthesis though its proponents insist that it is a distinct discipline. the main difference between the two theories is that evolutionary psychology insists on the mismatch between the time where most of the evolution has taken place and the modern world where we are living : our modern skulls house a stone age mind tooby  cosmide 5th principle.
 still others think that the discipline in general and cosmides and tooby in particular are too quick to generalize and draw conclusions from the very limited data they present. the book the adapted mind is notorious for among other things using their methods to explain differences in behavior between the sexes.
 between  and  thousands of researchers have published in this field and the applications of evolutionary psychology range now from sex differences and sexual competition to polemology. some of the most known authors are : sarah blaffer hrdy david buss david c. geary geoffrey miller steven pinker robert wright.

the focus it's made on the covert cooperation between the parties who are enemies . thanks  smear campaign by ..x..? deliberate resonance it received damascus ..  dec.  on september   just four days after  attacks cia director george tenet provided president sic bush a top secret worldwide attack matrix-a virtual license to kill targets deemed to be a threat to in some  countries around the world. the tenet plan which was subsequently approved by bush essentially reversed the executive orders of four previous u.s. administrations that expressly according to high level european intelligence officials bush's counselor karl rove used the new presidential authority to silence a popular lebanese christian politician was planning to offer irrefutable evidence that israeli prime minister ariel sharon authorized the massacre of hundreds of palestinian men women children in the beirut refugee camps of sabra and shatilla in . in addition sharon provided the lebanese forces who carried out the grisly task. at the time of the massacres elie hobeika was intelligence chief of lebanese christian forces in lebanon were battling palestinians and other muslim groups bloody civil war. also the chief liaison to israeli defense force idf personnel in lebanon. an commission merely found sharon indirectly responsible for slaughter and fingered hobeika as chief instigator. the kahan commission never called on hobeika to offer testimony in his defense. however in response to charges brought against sharon before a special war crimes in belgium hobeika was urged to testify against sharon according to well-informed lebanese sources. hobeika was prepared to offer a different version of events than what was contained in the kahan report. a  belgian law permitting human rights prosecutions was unusual in that non-belgians could be tried for violations against other non-belgians in a belgian court. under pressure from the bush administration the law was severely amended and the extra territoriality hobeika headed the lebanese forces intelligence agency since the mid- 1970s and he soon developed close ties to the cia. he was a frequent visitor to the cia's headquarters at langley virginia. after the syrian invasion of lebanon in  hobeika held a number of cabinet positions in the lebanese government a proxy for the syrian occupation authorities. he also served in the parliament. in july  hobeika called a press conference and announced he was prepared to testify against sharon in belgium and revealed that he had evidence of what actually occurred in sabra and shatilla. hobeika also indicated that israel had flown members of the south lebanon army sla into beirut international airport in an israeli air force c transport plane in full view of dozens of witnesses including members of the lebanese army and others. sla troops under the command of major saad haddad were slipped into the camps to commit the massacres. the sla troops were under the direct command of ariel sharon and an israeli mossad agent provocateur named rafi eitan. hobeika offered evidence that a former u.s. ambassador to lebanon was aware of the israeli plot. in addition the idf had placed a camera in a strategic position to film the sabra and shatilla massacres. hobeika was going to ask that the footage be released as part of the investigation of sharon. after announcing he was willing to testify against sharon hobeika became fearful for his safety and began moves to leave lebanon. hobeika was not aware that his threats to testify against sharon had triggered a series of fateful events that reached well into the white house and sharon's office. on january   hobeika's car was blown up by a remote controlled bomb placed in a parked mercedes along a street in the hazmieh section of beirut. the bomb exploded when hobeika and his three associates fares souweidan mitri ajram and waleed zein were driving their range rover past the tnt-laden mercedes at : am beirut time. the range rover's four passengers were killed in the explosion. in hobeika's car had taken another route through the neighborhood two additional parked cars located at two other choke points were also rigged with tnt. the powerful bomb wounded a number of other people on the street. other parked cars were destroyed and buildings and homes were damaged. the lebanese president prime minister and interior minister all claimed israeli agents were behind the it is noteworthy that the state department's list of global terrorist incidents for  worldwide failed to list the car bombing attack on hobeika and his party. the white house wanted to ensure the attack was censored from the report. the reason simple: the attack ultimately had washington's fingerprints on it. high level european intelligence sources now report that karl rove personally coordinated hobeika's assassination. the hit on hobeika employed syrian intelligence agents. syrian president bashar assad was trying to curry favor with bush administration in the aftermath of  and was more than willing to help the white house. in addition assad's father hafez assad had been an ally of bush's father during desert storm a period that saw washington give a wink and a nod to syria's occupation of lebanon. rove wanted to help sharon avoid any political embarrassment from an in absentia trial in brussels where hobeika would be a star witness. rove and sharon agreed on the plan to use syrian military intelligence agents to assassinate hobeika. rove saw sharon as an indispensable ally of bush in ensuring the loyalty of the christian evangelical and jewish voting blocs in the united states. sharon saw the plan to have coordinate the hit as a way to mask all connections to jerusalem. the syrian hit team was ordered by assef shawkat the number two man in syrian military intelligence and a good friend and brother in law of syrian president bashar assad. assad's intelligence services had already cooperated with u.s. intelligence in resorting to unconventional methods to extract information from al qaeda detainees deported to syria from the united states and other countries in the wake of . the order to take out hobeika was transmitted by shawkat to roustom ghazali the head syrian military intelligence in beirut. ghazali arranged three remote controlled cars to be parked along hobeika's route in hazmieh only few hundred yards from the barracks of syrian special forces which are stationed in the area near the presidential palace  the ministry of defense and various government and officers quarters . this particular area is covered by a very sophisticated usa multi-agency surveillance system to monitor syrian and lebanese security activities and is a  choice  area to live in for its perceived high security courtesy the special collections services. the plan to kill hobeika had all the necessary caveats and built-in denial mechanisms. if the syrians were discovered beforehand or afterwards karl rove and his associates in the pentagon's office of special plans would be hobeika's cia intermediary in beirut a man only referred to as jason by hobeika was a frequent companion of the lebanese politician during official and off-duty hours. during hobeika's election campaigns for his parliamentary seat jason was often in hobeika's office offering support and advice. after hobeika's assassination jason became despondent over the death of his colleague. eventually jason disappeared abruptly from lebanon and reportedly later emerged in pakistan. karl rove's involvement in the assassination of hobeika may not have been the last hit he ordered to help out sharon. in march  a few months after hobeika's assassination another lebanese christian with knowledge of sharon's involvement in the sabra and shatilla massacres was gunned down along with his wife in sao paulo brazil. a bullet fired at michael nassar's car flattened one of his tires. nassar pulled into a gasoline station for repairs. a professional assassin firing a gun with a silencer shot nassar and his wife in the head killing them both instantly. the assailant fled and was never captured. nassar was also involved with the phalange militia at sabra and shatilla. nassar was also reportedly willing to testify against sharon in belgium and as a nephew of sla commander general antoine lahd may have had important evidence to bolster hobeika's charge that sharon ordered sla forces into the camps to wipe out the palestinians. based on what european intelligence claims is concrete intelligence on rove's involvement in the assassination hobeika the bush administration can now add political assassination to its laundry list of other misdeeds from lying about the reasons to go to war to the torture tactics in violation the geneva conventions that have been employed by the pentagon and third country nationals at prisons in iraq  guantanamo bay morocco and various east european locations among others . it is noteworthy that the state department's list of global terrorist incidents for  worldwide failed to list the car bombing attack on hobeika and his party . listed a small hand grenade thrown at a u.s. franchise .? white house wanted to ensure attack was censored from the report. the reason was simple: the attack ultimately had washington's fingerprints on .

38	 pl:executable and linkable format
 the executable and linkable format elf is a common standard in computing for and object code. first published in the tool interface standard and the system v application binary interface it was quickly accepted among different vendors of unix systems.
 today the elf format has replaced the proprietary or sometimes just platform specific executable formats in the linux solaris operating irix and some berkeley software operating systems.
 other object code file formats are a.out and coff elf could be considered a competitor to those.
 each elf file is made up of one elf header followed by zero or more segments and zero or more sections. the segments contain information that is necessary for runtime execution of the file while sections contain important data for linking and relocation. each byte in the entire file is taken by no more than one section at a time but there can be orphan bytes which are not covered by a section. in the normal case of a unix executable one or more sections are enclosed in one segment. the segments and sections of the file are listed in a program header table and section header table respectivly.
 on many unix systems the command

noelle lenoir rapport sur la socit europenne . although i intend to leave the description of this empire to a particular treatise yet in the meantime i am content to gratify the curious reader with some general ideas . european business community had been waiting for the european company for more than forty years when negotiations suddenly succeeded abracadabra-like at the summit of nice. we will not go into the details of the history of negotiations which have been presented elsewhere by blanquet. we shall start by submitting three arguments in favour of the se. firstly the se is essential to the realisation of the single european market since it allows free movement of companies and capital. secondly while at present companies wishing to set up business in another member state have to undergo a costly and complex process in order to comply with the laws of that state this would no longer be the case if a single body of rules was applicable throughout the ec. a fortiori a global option for a single european accounting rule will help the system. thirdly the installation of the se will aid the transfer of technology in the internal european market. it will put in place a common system of financial information and lead to better protection of intellectual property rights. consequently the se will be an opportunity not only for france but also for all the players and the member states interested in win-win strategies. in our opinion the se allows some very specific operations that cannot be set up without a real european legal structure. in their day to day management the lawyers or legal counsel in the companies may experience the following:  harmonisation of community law creates juridical solutions different from those of yesterday.  there is a strong demand from top management to lower the costs of analyses.  specialisation of the business implies a new management of the teams. therefore industry and especially groups which are facing the practical lack of a common corporate structure were favourable to the se. prior to the nice summit however the modern french doctrine in favour of the se faced severe scepticism. the dominant authors in this time were strongly in favour of the classical operations and mergers. apart from the traditional debate about the legal definition of the enterprise  very few publications or books available in france can be considered as  related to the precise topic of the most recent development of the regulation and directive towards achieving a single european legal entity or european company. . at this time the idea to use the shadow european company together with the sas in a business context was a fortiori supposed to be a very original solution and this theoretical hypothesis was supported by very few authors. since the historic breakthrough interest in the european company has considerably increased which can be proved by the activity of the french senate which hosted two conferences in on the topic of the european company. some are of the opinion that the se may only be used in the strategies of the groups which only have a european dimension prima facie . others even regard the se as a lost cause  anyway we have to admit that both the regulation and the directive are applicable under article  of the regulation and  of the directive and that october 8th  can be taken as a checkpoint. senator branger who is politically active in favour of the se takes the success of european co-operation in company law as a strong symbol. he promotes workers involvement and the free movement of companies through the se since early . firstly he hosted the first international moot court on the se which took place at the palais du luxembourg on may 20th . this event was prepared under the high supervision of rector hommelhoff in heidelberg of dean faugre and prof. delcross from the facult jean monnet sceaux paris xi in france. the moot court conference was a great success and received the support of the french prime minister jean  pierre raffarin . the scenario was written discussed and validated by a large number of european lawyers and as described below was dedicated to the creation of a closed holding company located in germany. senator hyest presented the economic questions which were currently pending before the french parliament. france is strongly determined to modernise its commercial law in order to welcome the changes and to keep an open approach to europe. secondly a group of experts is currently working on the two key aspects of the se in france on behalf of senator branger and of senator hyest. the spirit of the work is to enrich the current drafts of the report and analysis with open independent and differing approaches to the text and especially the following:  putting in place the necessary machinery in order to study and choose the options that are opened in the regulation such as: article              quarter               etc.  drafting a law on the basis of the directive. this report will probably be communicated shortly for the purpose of a public discussion any news on that? or can we leave the sentence as it is?. the first part of the report is dedicated to the common problems shared by the member states in the process of introducing the se into their national laws. title  is dedicated to the new company and explains on the one hand the current work in the member states and on the second hand the need for harmonisation of the national systems if the member states really want to play the game. title  introduces the se as a strong political symbol the first chapter discusses the before-and-after principle and the second underlines the need for a common body of rules about the se which is included in the regulation. the second part of the report offers to the french government both a motivation and a guideline in order to include the se into french law as precisely as possible. title  is an introductory title which deals with the advantages of an se french fashioned the first part of this presentation is linked to the organisation of groups and the second part is focused on small and medium sized companies. title  is focused on the method and the options given to the governments by the regulation and the directive. b. french company law and the se the on-going economic reforms reforms of the new economic regulations are the fruit of a technique called codification  droit constant which has its virtues but the method implies constant and global work for the legislator. the second is the obligation to deal with the issues presented by the european company statute imposed on the governments in the context of three legislative areas:  a regulation establishing the se statute which is directly applicable in every member state.  a directive on worker involvement which will have to be implemented in national law in all member states. the national laws designated by the regulation and directive. should we provide some definitions that could be helpful for the reader? i. the distinction between directors and directeurs particular attention should be given to terminology: in legal terms the french word directeur is not a translation of director in the sense of a member of the board of a company but instead directeur would usually be translated as manager. however a director being an individual appointed to the board of the company by the shareholders would normally be translated as an administrateur or mandataire social. an administrateur is solely an officer of the company in french a mandataire social who does not have a contract of employment with the company and thus does not benefit from french labour law. the practical consequence is that an administrateur can generally be dismissed from his or her position without notice or compensation although the method of dismissal should not be vexatious. in many cases an administrateur or director of a french company might also have a contract of employment but this would be considered in french law to be totally separate from his role as an officer of the company. such a contract of employment would relate to a specific function without the role of director and might for example be in his capacity as financial manager sales manager or h.r. manager this agreement would give the employee the full protection of french labour law provisions. ii. summary of the legal regime of the se and its national cousins sa sas and sarl france has no judicial definition of enterprise  this word can only be found in fiscal or economical provisions. from a legal perspective a company is a form of organisation of a business. the legal regime of the se will be the regime of the socits anonymes sa. therefore we should briefly consider the three main french commercial entities: socits  responsabilit limite sarl socits anonymes sa and socits par actions simplifies sas. the sarl must have a minimum of one shareholder has no directors and is run by a grant or ceo chief executive officer. this ceo can be a stockholder. if he owns a minority of the capital he may have the benefit of an employment contract. however if he has the majority this possibility disappears. an sa must have a minimum of seven shareholders. two different types of management structure may be put in place in an sa : i the monistic type with a one-tier management structure which consists of a board of directors conseil dadministration comprising a minimum of  and a maximum of  directors administrateurs appointed by and from the shareholders and ii the dualistic type with a two-tier management structure which consists of a management board directoire supervised by a supervisory board conseil de surveillance. the management board comprises between  and  members  members if the s.a. is a listed company. the supervisory board comprises a minimum of  and a maximum of  members appointed by and from the shareholders. the directors can be considered as employed and protected as far as pensions social insurance etc. if they are in a management position on behalf of the company. as in the se the by-laws of an sas are not standardised although statute law provides for a number of matters which must obligatorily appear therein. the principal characteristic of the s.a.s. is the flexibility in organisation of the management of the company the conditions in which shareholders decisions can be adopted and the relationships between the shareholders subject to the following minimum requirements set out in the commercial code. a chairman prsident must be appointed to represent the company in its dealing with third parties. some decisions such as the approval of the accounts the appointment of the statutory auditors any amendment of the share capital or a merger must be made by the shareholders in accordance with the provisions of the by-laws. the by-laws may freely determine the organisation of the internal management of the company and provide for example for the setting up of committees a supervisory board etc. the new article l  of the french commercial code introduces a new link between the corporate governance of the sa and the organisation of the sas. the new law introduces a directeur gnral or directeur gnral dlgu in the sas these functions were traditionally assumed by the legal representatives of the sa. the shareholders and officers of an sas can be either individuals or bodies corporate. the sas can be governed by a sole shareholder. during the initial period of implementation of the se in national law the benefit of cross-border mergers that will give birth to an se will be reserved to the sa. the sas is however finding favour with a number of foreign particularly us japanese and swiss corporations which are setting up subsidiaries in france. using the sas foreign partners will be able to set up a subsidiary se that could be a convenient way to organise a partnership between medium sized companies. this example was given during the moot court which took place in the french senate on 20th may . the se thereby can be helpful in order to set up a closed holding and or to open the capital in keeping with a multi-listing process or a single market stock. iii. is there a place for a closed and contractual se located in france? the sas is a modern company form which serves as a flexible tool to those companies which regard the traditional stock corporation law as being too rigid. the introduction of this new flexible form in the nineties of the last century is generally considered as a great success of the french legislator. however its position in the context of the formation and running of an se remains unclear. in france the sas is regarded as not really being a socit anonyme but a separate legal form. the se regulation however in its appendixes i and ii only makes a reference to the socit anonyme the socit  responsabilit limite and to article  ec. the french government will determine whether or not the sas will be considered as an sa with the exception of the provisions which are not compliant with the directives and have the benefit of mergers through the se. as we shall see below some arguments are in favour of this idea. some are of the opinion that the sas is not a company which complies with art.  ec . the question remains open. as it has been demonstrated during the moot court which took place at the french senate on may   the sas gives to the players the opportunity to build some flexible links not only with the countries of common law. the demand is presently located in markets mainly in europe or abroad and the se can be helpful in simplifying the policies of a group wishing to play on the european market. a debate does exist in france about the possibilities of corporate governance which could be partly based on agreement the main advantage of the sas lies in the fact that the principal source of obligations is the statue of the company itself. the contractual sphere that exists in the se has to be subject to analysis. article  of the regulation gives rise to thought concerning the contractual scope that already exists in the regulation. . an se's statutes shall list the categories of transactions which require authorisation of the management organ  by the supervisory organ in the two tier system or an express decision by the administrative organ in the one-tier system. a member state may however provide that in the two-tier system the supervisory organ may itself determine certain categories of transactions that will be subject to authorisation. . a member state may determine the categories of transactions which must at least be indicated in the statutes of ses registered within its territory. the french government could read this article in keeping with the provisions of article . this analysis should lead to distinction between the topics expressly or partly mentioned in the regulation workers involvement transfer of seat and the domestic law on the socits anonymes which will be applicable to the other matters pensions intellectual property fiscal issues corporate governance. to the question why dont we create a closed and contractual european company ? the reply of the french government could be: go ahead! c. formation of an se there are several ways in which to set up a european company:  merger of two or more existing public limited companies from at least two different eu member states  formation of a holding company promoted by public or private limited companies from at least two different member states  formation of a subsidiary by companies from at least two different member states  transformation of a public limited company which has for at least two years had a subsidiary in another member state. the present study will be focused only on the first three cases. i. participating companies the head offices of which are not located in the community the regulation expressly mentions that a member state may provide that a company the head office of which is not in the community may participate in the formation of an se provided that the company is formed under the law of a member state has its registered office in that member state and has a real and continuous link with a member state's economy. france will have no difficulties in applying this provision directly . a negotiation process could probably solve the questions that could be discussed in this case. french company law for example authorises the sa monistic or dualistic to have or not to have a body representing the employees. in the case of the putting in place in france of a subsidiary se which is the subsidiary of a gmbh with a co-determination system and of an sas without any employees involvement the only way to start with such a joint venture will be to find a win-win agreement between the players. france will probably adopt an open position regarding the social harmonisation and the mutual recognition that it implies . could this exercise be carried out more easily in a closed se? ii. the se: a convenient subsidiary which can move throughout europe. the following scheme shows the different bodies playing in a group. the shareholders the trade unions and the management can be distributed among separate entities that are incorporated in different countries in europe or abroad. the demand is presently located in markets mainly in europe or abroad and the se can be helpful in simplifying the policies of a group wishing to play on the european market.each member state should be able to decide which companies could be used for this purpose. . the classical cross-border transaction from a french point of view and thanks to the discreet bridges that are built for the se between the european and local forums let us describe below how the se can be used as a subsidiary which could be set up between industrial partners in order to be present in a niche . a map of the activities of a group b classical transaction: exchange of half the new shares of a and b between the holding companies this scheme has the virtue of being quite usual. it has been used for example in the dexia case. most executives would prefer these schemes in order to set up cross-border business if they are not  comfortable with the rules of the se. there is however a natural risk at the level of the transfer of ip rights. if for example the corporate department is separated from the ip department or if the due diligences are managed too quickly the process of registration of the transfers of portfolios before the national patent and trademark offices can be difficult. the practical risk for the purchaser is to face the impossibility of enforcement. secondly this scheme of co-operation is asking a few questions from the european industrial property side e.g. in terms of exhaustion of rights and judicial and or administrative justification of a position. anyway the se will be an optional instrument for all the players and the above scheme of organisation will obviously remain and especially while the current work of the commission on the relevant directives is not complete especially if the se is a closed company. in this case the parties can negotiate a common way of valuing their shares and stocks. a member of the holding can decide to leave the deal with cash compensation if that possibility exists e.g. in the state of incorporation. . transaction using an se: a simplification that implies negotiations on the transfers costs and real co-operation between the member states and the european entities which are in charge of the putting in place of the se. a the experience of the moot court we experienced such a negotiation in the moot court at the french senate on may . the scenario was the following: a french sas  employees and an austrian gmbh  employees intend to found a common subsidiary in the form of a societas europaea se arco se  which will have its registered office in paris france and will have  employees. the ses main object is the production of healthcare products at the same time the se sets up a research and development centre for the development of new products. unpol se an se formed in poland by means of a merger of a polish and a hungarian company decides to become a partner and to provide arcotec with its support. consequently unpol has the benefit of one share from arco se. meanwhile a danish public limited liability company and a swedish public limited liability company  employees each are co-operating on a common rd project on infusion technology. the result produced by this research programme was so satisfactory that the two companies decided to file a jointly held european patent. with a view to jointly exploiting the patent and expanding their production the nordic companies decide to merge and to form a european company hamek se with its registered office in copenhagen denmark. however development and production of new medical instruments are expensive. hamek se therefore approaches arco and offers to combine know-how and experience so that they can commercialise their products together. the two ses intend to place a new system for remote control of an infusion pump via a central display on the market. at the moment they do not plan the formation of a new company on the contrary both companies would remain free in their production and distribution decisions. a german ag  tec ag   employees learns about this co-operation. tec ag has a minority with . like the other companies it intends to enter the market for medical instruments. to achieve this aim the german ag proposes to the other companies that they form a holding-se arcotec se with a share capital of . euro and its registered office in heidelberg germany. an expert evaluates the companies promoting the holding se and ascertains the following values: arco se:  euro hamek se:  euro tec ag:  euro. having established the holding se the management decides to introduce a common management structure in the group and to transform tec ag into an se. thereby the monistic management system can be applied in all of arcotecs subsidiaries. the austrian shareholders of arcotec propose the potential transfer of seat to vienna austria because of the excellence of the research of the faculty of medicine of the university of vienna. the other shareholders consider the advantages of other member states. the issue was to discuss the best conditions for the company law economy taxes social system infrastructure and education. we must state at first sight that some countries already permit mergers between them denmark sweden and that others are prepared as well to host a closed holding se. mr marc favero and dr. silja maul launched the discussion about the best methods in order to open the holding or part of it. b independent reports and mergers both the parties and the member states should designate independent bodies that will have the task of verifying the process utilised in the formation of the company. this could be done under the responsibility and control of the traditional chartered accountants and legal bodies that are currently working on cross border operations. we are of the opinion that a european co ordination office or a body of national experts would be helpful in order to centralise the information about the se. anyway the players will have to distinguish between two periods: before and after the registration of the se. the law of the parties should enable the legal domicile that will govern the new se to be determined. in france like in the other member states we will have to determine some guidelines for this independent evaluation in order to recognise a priori the information given by the parties under their responsibility. an independent body of experts which could be appointed on a national or european level could verify the compliance of the reports social agreements and financial information with the european requirements especially in three fields:  firstly in the case of mergers the national laws might be written in keeping with the ratio legis of the se especially a consensus should be found about the transcription and the application of article  and  of the regulation.  secondly the same statement can be made about the before-and-after principle. prior to any movement or creation of an se the parties and third parties should be able to verify if an agreement on workers involvement has been made under the provisions of article  of the directive.  thirdly in order to prevent funny practices in cross border operations a member state could decide under the provisions of article  of the regulation that a competent authority can oppose the transfer on grounds of public interest. france may pay special attention to these aspects. the process should facilitate for instance the putting in place of the se in a few closed groups and by the way france may especially decide to give an advantage to the companies which are playing the se in order to cut the general and administration costs. this method could be shared by the other member states in a win  win approach. an sas could be used for this purpose and have the advantage by its social aspect but under the before-and-after principle and on a negotiated basis even if an se may have at least three members seated at the board when the standard rules are applicable. locally some place has to be made in company law to accommodate special cases e.g. the french sas could be assimilated to a private socit anonyme in order to gain the benefit of setting up a se through mergers . in the member states the idea of a new national european company which could be adopted only for the purpose of the se could be discussed as an option. pursuant to article  member states may adopt provisions designed to ensure appropriate protection for minority shareholders who have opposed the merger. in the cases of mergers the regulation goes very far when it provides under article    that the action of a minority could impeach the process. from a practical aspect this provision could be a major issue for listed groups. on the contrary in closed companies held by a single body the decision process might be easier. this provision would only make sense in the countries where this protection is not organised under domestic law this is not the case in france. a similar provision is contained in article  of the regulation with regard to the formation of a holding se. the shareholders of the companies promoting the operation shall have a period of three months in which to inform the promoting companies whether they intend to contribute their shares to the formation of the holding se. iv. opposition by a public authority pursuant to art.  of the regulation a member state may provide that any of the member states competent authorities may oppose the merger. this provision can be understood especially bearing in mind recital no.  of the preamble which provides: the se should be enabled to transfer its registered office to another member state. adequate protection of the interests of minority shareholders who oppose the transfer of creditors and of holders of other rights should be proportionate. such transfer should not affect the rights originating before the transfer. as discussed above we are of the opinion that the fair co-operation between the european authorities and the member states which are conducting the putting in place of the se will be essential for the success of the se . v. special negotiating body in the case of a european company created through a merger the standard principles on participation of its workers would be applied when at least   of employees had the right to participate before the merger . employment contracts and pensions are not covered by the regulation. they would be subject to national law in the member states where the headquarters and branches operated: this provision may be included in the process. let us propose the positive vision of a merger that can be planned in a closed group in which there are no special claims from the minorities or from the workers. the merger will take place between two highly compatible countries such as denmark and sweden or other partners. in this case the statute of the se could deal with the following:  title : form name  se object registered office duration statutory provisions in keeping with the law of the registered office.  title : contributions corporate capital and shares.  title : board of directors management and statutory auditor  title : workers involvement conditions of the participation  title : general share holders meetings  title : corporate financial year profits and reserves  title : losses dissolution and liquidation. the exchange of the shares should be managed as follow: the auditors may provide the assembly with a clear statement about minority protection. the special negotiating body should in the meantime be working on the following items which are to be included in the statutes of the new se:  scope of the agreement  composition number of members and allocation of seats on the representative body which will be the discussion partner of the competent organ of the se in connection with arrangements for the information and consultation of the employees of the se and its subsidiaries and establishments etc if the standard rules are chosen the following could appear in the statutes:  composition of the body representative of the employees  standard rules for information and consultation  standard rules for participation. such a corporate organisation seems realistic to us especially from the fiscal side. we have listed the provisions that are mandatory in the regulation in order to set up a holding se. if there is a difficulty the provisions concerning mergers should be applicable. co-ordination is necessary anyway in order to enable the european travellers to cross the national rivers thanks to the bridge se. for instance no se will be set up without an agreement or a provision in the by-laws about the involvement of the employees. this is an opportunity for them to make the choice of a demonstration of mutual understanding and respect by setting up social agreements that could appear different at first sight but that will never be less favourable than the previously existing system. afterwards the lawyers and the accountants will do what they are paid for. from our point of view it will be difficult to set up an effective and secure business through the se as long as there is no european register for the centralisation of publications and of the relevant questions linked to the se. in france the registre du commerce et des socits which is the central companies register is closely linked and works on a permanent basis with the national patent and trademark office which gathers the relevant information about the fonds de commerce. the national office provides interested parties with the information which is available in france. this technique of twinning directives that have a certain direct effect through a regulation has been used by the european union in order to incorporate in local legislation the provisions of the new legal instruments of the european commerce such as community trademarks or designs. industrial property lawyers are used in their day to day practice to dealing with such instruments in co-operation with the competent european offices e. g. the oami in alicante. the authorities in charge of the global implementation of the se throughout the ec should be well inspired from the french model in order to provide the member states with such a co-ordination support or equivalent structure. . the se as a subsidiary: a cross-border co-operation that opens a field of negotiations in the contractual sphere  euros in minimum capital opens the se to small and medium sized firms which are able to face international competition or to form joint ventures. the joint venture can for instance be found attractive for setting up community programmes in favour of innovation. for example we can imagine that a greek an italian spanish and a french company located in france will use the se to get together in order to comply with the european funds requirements dedicated to help projects in the mediterranean islands e.g. corsica sardinia sicily. we can also imagine a case of a private holding created between medium sized companies in order to be present in a technological niche. the french legal regime to which an se will subject already provides for the one-tier and the two-tier system of management. from this point of view the task of the french legislator could be less difficult than in austria or in the countries where the se obliges the member state to create a new management system. it is possible in france to set up a se either with a monistic structure or with the two-tier organisation. furthermore the involvement of workers is not linked to the internal organisation but to the number of employees. the statements that are made about the new economic regulation and the power of the employees should not be changed by the adoption of the se. in accordance with the before-and-after principle the companies may draft an agreement fully compliant with the provisions of the directive especially with art. .  and then decide to make an express reference to this agreement in the by-laws. this method has been used by the students in order to find a win  win agreement during the moot court. pursuant therefore to the provisions of article   a i of the directive the special negotiating body should be composed by one representative for each ten percent of the employees. these representatives will be elected to the board by the employees of the se. however this negotiation even compliant with the directive should not lead to a reduction of the involvement of the workers from member states in which the co determination is mandatory in the management of the new company. such an agreement should be easier to find in closed companies or in countries which are flexible or admit workers to the board on a voluntary basis . anyway we shall plead for a negotiated and flexible approach . ii. two tier system the option which is contained in article  of the regulation and which offers to the member states to require or permit the statutes to provide that the member or members of the management organ shall be appointed and removed by the general meeting. the current law should not be amended on this point but could be adopted in order to welcome the se in france. the same remark can be made about the option offered by article   and . the option actually makes sense in the member states that have not chosen this type of organisation. italy can be taken as an extraordinary example of adaptation the new law provides a large scope for corporate governance as well as codes of conducts and corporate governance codes. in france the law is currently changing and article l      of the commercial code shall be redrafted. anyway the french two tier se might stay french fashioned . regarding the classical mode of corporate governance the regulation is very precise but will not result in any great change in french law. for instance article  the number of members of the administrative organ or the rules for determining it shall be laid down in the ses statutes. this provision is especially interesting when considering that the sas is linked to the sa. a provision which has probably been adopted under german influence is that according to which the administrative organ shall however consist of at least tree members where employees participation is regulated in accordance with the directive . anyway this could be considered as a potential issue in the companies which are currently managed by less than three directors. iv. rules common to both systems article  provides that a member state may permit a company or other legal entity to be a member of an organ of the se. we are of the opinion that this provision could be another chance for the sas . france is currently studying the opportunity of changing the current dualistic system pursuant to article    and . the second point providing that a member state may determine the categories of transactions which must at least be indicated in the statutes of ses is subject to analysis. france may have the choice to provide the se with a strong contractual sphere and this could be a safer option especially for the creditors. pursuant to article  of the regulation the first general meeting has to be held at any time in the  months following an ses incorporation in france this option should be managed under the provisions of article l  of the commercial code. the opportunity that is given to the member states in the regulation under arts.  and  gives rise to the following considerations. less than  of the stockholders should be able to convene a general meeting art  and to put additional items on the agenda art . article  seems to allow this right only to the holders of stocks that are linked to subscribed capital. anyway a minority should respond in court to an abuse. pursuant to article  if no meeting is held within two months following the request the competent judicial or administrative authority may order that a general meeting be convened. in france with regard to the urgent aspect of such an issue the relevant procedure should be the rfr. a practical point could arise about the calculation of the delay of two months if the national law is not more precise than the regulation. the same question remains with regard to art. . we are of the opinion that in france a majority under the provisions of article l  will be sufficient for any amendment of the statutes. e. transfer of seat we experienced in the moot court that the se has a direct effect on the sex appeal of the national legislation. each country is endeavouring to attract new companies by showing a nice and good face! we would say that this new wave in company law is refreshing our old continent in a pleasant way. from a practical side our opinion remains that the management nerve of a group should be difficult to locate . a balance must be found on a few points. firstly regarding the option included in article  and providing that a member state may in addition impose on ses registered in its territory the obligation of locating its head office and registered office at the same place. anyway after a period of probation and of definition of the procedures linked to the travelling se and pursuant to article  the regulation could generally allow this option. secondly the possible opposition by public authorities provided by article  the debate will take place under the current european case law . pursuant to arts.  ec and  ec a company formed in accordance with the law of a member state and having its registered office is exercising its freedom of establishment in another member state may be recognised by the host member state in its legal capacity and its capacity to be a party to legal proceedings. this rule may a fortiori be applicable to the se. protection of minority shareholders under article  and protection of creditors under article  should be regarded by the legislator with the same eyes as those that are used in order to translate the process of international merger or of setting up a holding se into local laws. f. involvement of employees it is the first time in france that a preliminary condition about the involvement of the workers shall be mandatory prior to the first registering of a company. it was difficult to find a medium position between no participation at all and the various national models. the principles which are of direct effect have been introduced in the regulation which offers a few simple options to the governments and the standard principles coming from the directive have been discussed above. we may add that out of the moot court experience we feel that not only in france each organ of the se must be negotiated and shaped through a common guideline which can make the things easier. the directive will guide managers who want to try the se to provide regular reports on the basis of which there must be regular consultation of and information to a body representing the companies employees. these reports must detail the companies current and future business plans production and sales levels implications of these for the workforce management changes mergers divestments potential closures and layoffs. anyway the directive will not significantly change the french labour law. in the classical cases of mergers or scission which is impossible through the se when a comit dentreprise is concerned the negotiation process is mandatory in france. contrary to previously when the parties are unable to negotiate a mutually satisfactory agreement and the companies involved in the creation of an se were previously covered by participation rules a european company would apply standard principles on the participation of its workers. this would be the case of a european company created as a holding company or joint-venture. in a group with several subsidiaries a co-ordination board could exist to manage the workers involvement issues. such issues remain the same throughout the various european subsidiaries or establishments. in some european countries the idea of worker involvement is relatively new and not so extensive as in other countries. in others it is based  on negotiation between the social partners. last but not least we should mention the main fiscal issues. presently we can hear two current visions of the mutual recognition of the companies:  free movement for all the companies and a single tax policy throughout europe that sounds nowadays like a former option. transfer and mergers through the se this option considers the se as a national company and is careful of the sovereign power of the member states on their international tax policy. the european company must be registered in the member state where it has its administrative head office. this is according to the commission the only system that allows effective supervision of the whole se so as to avoid the se being used for doubtful practices such as tax fraud or money laundering. in the meantime the governments are working on a tax code that would be subject to a european tax policy. there would be a fiscal advantage in creating a european company by merger registered in the most favourable member state for tax purposes but operating through subsidiaries located in the member states. h. conclusion: will the se significantly change the national philosophies of company law? we are of the opinion that the answer to this question will be quite the same in each country and we can bet that it will certainly be more or less a soft no! but and there is a but the se will probably allow new strategies and we have the chance to have the support of our countries to think about it. the se will be an optional tool which will be broadly opened to all national entities. this instrument can lead to a common practice of business and social law. beyond the current practices the se is a challenging topic for the european businessmen lawyers and member states not only from a technical point of view. from the human side the se can be a bridge over troubled water: the options of simplicity and efficiency the possibility given to managers to cut the general and administration costs prior to social costs will only come true if all the parties in charge of the se on a political level are active to help the managers who decided to go ahead on this bridge. while it is difficult to imagine a se only dedicated to national business the way of playing the se with a common regulation is a way of mutual recognition. this way implies generosity tolerance and probably sometimes the players will have to compromise before finding the appropriate solutions. we wish the se and its players will live under the government of reason  so that the societas europeae and its crews could have pleasant travels. :  october  utcj.-l. :  october  utc 
38	by france refused to adopt a closed sa that was proposed in order to let the medium sized business have the benefit of the se. see on the topic: texte n   de mm. jean-guy branger et jean jacques hyest dpos au snat le  juillet . wass'nt: before the entry into force of the french law senator branger and his group are questioning the goverment on a constant basis: there is obviously a judicial risk that lays into the difrences that remains between the regulation and the directive and the curent french law. for the questions see: france did not make this choice! this probably explains why mrs lenoir does not mention any clue about the work that was made long before her and leaded to the adoption of the se with a pure european background and not too national. here is in my opinion the main difference between european and us corporate law. courts company. one of the se that are registered in france was published before the adoption of the social part of the law! the risk is not important when the se have no employees. anywy in my opinion the fiscal risk remains! here in the north of france we have the gain of a huge industial space that is available we are close from northen europe and ready to start it is to pray for a new wind that might blow. very old models should be forgotten. a plce does exist for a socit ferme europenne this sa sould comply with the se regulation in order to let the business go on!
