10	vs double ended differential push-pull amplifiers functiontypically resulting in a monotonic distortion spectrum dominated by 2nd order harmonics and with other order components also present double ended amplifiers tend to result in substantial cancellation of even order harmonics lowering the total harmonic distortion however the resulting distortion spectrum is not monotonic and the dominant odd order products notably rd order are considered to sound unpleasant some audiophiles still the use of thermionic valve or tube designs instead of transistors including using mainly triodes in the output stage single-ended triode. tube circuits tend to be simpler than transistor circuits due to component cost factors but also that tubes are claimed to be more linear but notable exceptions exist in both directions. although tube power amp designs are more often class a and transistor power amp designs are almost always ab it should be clearly understood this is only due to design choices both tubes and transistors can both be applied in class a and class b designs of the basic operating classes a b ab etc single ended amplifiers operate in class a rather than class b by definition. double ended amplifiers can be biased by the designers choice into class a through ab to hard class b. operating in class a avoids crossover distortion and thus is more linear especially at levels at the expense of thermal and power efficiency and vice versa. note that class a amplifies are asymptotic to zero excluding noise as single level is reduced becoming exponentially less linear as the level is increased. conversely because b amplifiers suffer from crossover the magnitude of which is fixed they produce lowest at almost full rated power distortion rising are reduced power levels because the cross over distortion becomes proportionately larger. this is one reason why class a is preferred for especially accoustic and classical music which often is mainly at levels far below the peaks unlike eg thrash metal and other electronic music various other effects. it should be clear the character of designed in distortion is quite different from typical distortion arising from bade design for example crossover distortion one is inherently a double ended circuit and it can also be a phase splitter as well as an amplifier. one reason this circuit element is especially linear is that the current draw in the two arms is modulated in opposing ways so the total becomes almost constant. this avoids modulating supply which significant because supply modulations can affect many other circuit elements. the long tail pair also has good rejection cmrr of and residual supply modulation. in contrast se output stages including push pull totem poles tend to modulate the supply a function of signal being maplified

10	in  march  mr. serge hovnanian introduced a new concept in the chess psychology. in a match between mr. serge and im andrei kolov serge used a new cheating technique in chess which created a lot of controversy. many stood opposed to what sereg did and many other chess players around teh world were fascinated by his dexterity.the technique he used involves chaeting without moving any piece or without doing any physical illegal maneuver. however serge hovnanian a lebanese chess champion for  consecutive years managed to beat andrei kolov a highly ranked chess player in moscow. serge had enough time on his chess clock but kolov had a terrible time trouble but a winning position.kolov had to make his 20th move within the first hour of playing. since kolov was in time trouble he did not take notes of teh moves played. he looked at serge's notes to see what moves he had reached. on teh other hand serge skipped writing a move on his own paper on purpuse so kolov thought he still had time and lost eventually on time. some say that serge's technique was illegal and its called cheating others were fascinated.

10	though pv generation is positioned as environmentally friendly fabrication of pv cells utilizes substantial amounts of water in addition to toxic chemicals such as phosphorous and arsenic. these are often over-looked when promoting pv. because of strict environmental regulations in the united states for example pv fabrication is often performed in countries with lower standards such as china. 
10	in thermodynamics entropy has dimension energy divided by temperature which has a unit of joules per kelvin in the international system of units. the term entropy was coined in  by rudolf clausius based on the greek  entropa a turning toward from  en in and  trop turn conversion.cite etymology groupnotea machine in this context includes engineered devices as well as biological organisms. entropy is an abstract concept. as a tangible example imagine a closed system with two separated masses with two significantly different temperatures. some of the thermal energy can be converted into mechanical energy by adding a small heat engine to the system. instead if the two masses are brought together and put in contact then the heat of the warmer mass will freely flow to the cooler mass until the two are of some uniform intermediate temperature. after this heat flow the entropy of the system increases and the entropy multiplied by the intermediate temperature equals the thermal energy of the system and thus none of the thermal energy is available for conversion into mechanical work. when the two masses were still separated and had different temperatures the energy was order and disorder or sorted out into the two separated masses. after the heat flow the overall energy becomes more disordered. other definitions of entropy focus on this abstract concept of disorder. 
10	 erosion is the displacement of solids earth mud rock and so on through natural causes. there are several causes of erosion the most common being water or wind movements. as the material is removed it is carried to other locations and deposited as silt. this deposition is called sedimentation and most of the silt created by erosion ends up in sediment layers.
 erosion is in itself a naturally occurring process but it is in many cases increased by human activities. some of those include deforestation overgrazing and trail-building. likewise has humans sought to limit erosion by for example terrace-building and tree planting.
 one of the most serious and long-running water erosion problems on the planet is in china on the middle readhes of the yellow river and the upper reaches of the yangtse river. from the yellow river over . billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. the sediment originates primarily from water erosion in the loess plateau region of northwest china. the loess plateau covers an area of some  km in the upper and middle parts of the drainage basin of the yellow river world bank : china: air land and water
