7	time. this class of amplifier is unique to radio frequency ranges where the amplifier analysis is usually done in the frequency domain and not in the domain. this class is further divided to subclasses depending on which harmonics of the signal are taken into account during zero-voltage switching and zero-current switching with names such as class f and so on. square waves??? this paragraph is incorrect writer has no idea what he's talking about. class are rf amplifiers and thus usually analyzed in the frequency domain. neither class e nor class f generate a square wave signal. this paragraph is complete crap. do you have any references to these provisions designed into them? class are of the same family i recommend merging them to single entry. the major differences between the various sub-classes is which harmonics are canceled during zero-voltage switching zvs and zero-current switching zcs. 
7	several audio amplifier manufacturers have started inventing new classes as a way to differentiate themselves. these class names usually do not reflect any revolutionary amplification technique and are used mostly for marketing purposes. this can easily determined by the fact that the class name is trademarked or copyrighted. for example class t is a trademark of tripath company which manufactures audio amplifier ic's. this new class t is just a common class d amplifier operating at a frequency of khz with a proprietary modulator.

7	energy is basd on the energy theory. the greeks were actually not the ones who thought of this amazing theory. this theory refers to ancient work made a couple of thousands years ago found by archeologists in the state of iraq. the founder of this theory is saddam husen who was suffering from extreme brain dammage at this time and mainly during his whole life any way going back to the theory of energy saddam husen thought of it along with his fellow scientist santa clous.  a myth known by many of the christians and some other percents of the world population. santa clous this time wasn't a myth in this theory but a get scinetist. santa started to take most of saddam's credit by saying it was his idea. after a few years santa clous has noticed saddam's boyfriend and relized he was gay and homosexual. santa over the years started to like saddam's boyfreind and ended up doggy styling it. saddam noticed the spperm in his boyfriends bottom spongebob. saddam husen went back to hell and took the titanic along with him. he tied it to a rope above his bed. when finally santa clous doggy styled sponge bob again saddam took a minute to watch because he found watching porno interesting and then he untied the rope and the titanic smashed santa and sponge bob when they started oral sexual contact. therefore saddam husen is the one known for the inventor of energy theory. well-defined 
7	it is well known that a shannon based definition of information entropy leads in the classical case to the boltzmann entropy. it is tempting to regard the von neumann entropy as the corresponding quantum mechanical definition. but the latter is problematic from quantum information point of view. consequently stotland pomeransky bachmat and cohen have introduced a new definition of entropy that reflects the inherent uncertainty of quantum mechanical states. this definition allows to distinguish between the minimum uncertainty entropy of pure states and the excess statistical entropy of mixtures.  the information entropy of quantum mechanical states europhysics letters   .

7	before the contest itself the official labanese eurovision website of tl liban the labanese french speaking cable broadcaster gave a list of all paticipating countries excluding israel. as a result the ebu gave tl liban a  hours ultimatum to change the website. instead of adding the name of israel all the list of countries was erased and a picture of lebanon was put instead. that did not setisfy the ebu executives who were worried that lebanon will neither broadcast the israeli entry nor allow voting for it. following a direct demand from the ebu that lebanon would give a guarantee in advance for the broadcasting of the israeli entry tl liban withdrew from the contest claiming the labanese israel. this claim however is probably not correct as lebanon participates and broadcast every year in the miss world and miss universe pageants in which also participates. the labanese withdrawal was after the allowed deadline and the tl liban was fined and lebanon was banned from the contest for three more years which means they would only be allowed enter in . in  some lbc officials have stated that they would like to enter the esc on behalf of lebanon. lbc is the national broadcaster of lebanon an arabic speaking channel with western orientation. the officials said that should they decide to participate they have every intention of broadcasting entry or allow voting for it. 
7	the first serious study to analyze eurovision voting data was undertaken by gad yair from the hebrew university of jerusalem. his two studies of the competition till  have shown that voting is partitioned into three blocs western europe mediterranean north and that inter-bloc relations have remained stable  overbenefitting western countries. yair's studies promoted other scholars to extend the time frame of the competition papers now go as far as  and they have also provide more sophisticated mathematical models to assess the driving question: is the competition fair? are results based on the the quality of songs or on their country's location in the european bloc structure?

7	no jewish text makes the claim that ezra is the son of god. book of ezra a jewish text predating the time of muhammad states in that ezra is the son of seraiah. judaism holds the idea of any person being god or a part of god or a mediator to god to be heresy and no branch of judaism makes ezra a son of god.emunoth ve-deoth ii: exodus rabba  states  i am the first i have no father i am the last i have no brother. beside me there is no god i have no exod. rabba . of note is that judaism believes that god as the creator of time space and matter is beyond them and will not be born die or have a son. judaism teaches that it is heretical for any man to claim to be god part of god or the literal son of god. the jerusalem talmud another jewish text predating the time of muhammad states explicitly in taanit : : if a man claims to be god he is a liar. in karaite mourners use the word meha to represent a whole range of muslim anti-jewish slander including the lie that jews considered ezra to be the son of god. salmon b. yeruhim said a meha is one who reviles us for sins we have did and other which we haven't the latter includes the assertion that we take ezra as the son of bosybxif-xuwyirayiifdfpra-pam the belief that ezra is the son of god has never been a tenet of this is a clear problem of distorted knowledge of other religions and historical
