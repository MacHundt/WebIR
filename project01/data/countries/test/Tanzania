scheuer who led the cia's hunt for osama bin laden the al-qaeda leader was motivated by a belief that u.s. foreign policy has oppressed killed or otherwise harmed muslims in the middle east condensed in the phrase they hate us for what we do not who we are. bin laden also said only the restoration of sharia law would set things right in the muslim world and that alternatives pan-arabism socialism communism democracy must be opposed. this belief in conjunction with violent jihad has sometimes been called qutbism after being promoted by sayyid qutb. bin laden believed that afghanistan under the rule of mullah omar's taliban was the only islamic country in the muslim world. bin laden consistently dwelt on the need for violent jihad to right what he believed were injustices against muslims perpetrated by the united states and sometimes by other non-muslim states the need to eliminate the state of israel and the necessity of forcing the united states to withdraw from the middle east. he also called on americans to reject the immoral acts of fornication homosexuality intoxicants gambling and usury in an october  letter. bin laden's ideology included the idea that civilians including women and children are legitimate targets of jihad. bin laden was anti-semitic and delivered warnings against alleged jewish conspiracies: these jews are masters of usury and leaders in treachery. they will leave you nothing either in this world or next. shia muslims have been listed along with heretics   america israel the four principal enemies of islam at ideology classes of bin laden's al-qaeda organization. bin laden opposed music on religious grounds and his attitude towards technology was mixed. he was interested earth-moving machinery and genetic engineering of plants on one hand but rejected chilled water on the other. his viewpoints and methods of achieving them had led to him being designated as a terrorist by scholars journalists the new york times bbc and qatari news station al jazeera analysts peter bergen michael scheuer marc sageman and bruce hoffman. he was indicted terrorism charges by law enforcement agencies in madrid new york city tripoli. bin laden's overall strategy against much larger enemies the soviet union united states was to lure them into a long war attrition in muslim countries attracting large numbers of jihadists who would never surrender. he believed this would lead to economic collapse of the enemy nation. al-qaeda manuals clearly outline this strategy. in a  tape broadcast by al-jazeera bin laden spoke of bleeding america to the point of bankruptcy. militant activitymain article: militant activity of osama bin laden see also: cia-osama bin laden controversy mujahideen in afghanistanafter leaving college in  bin laden went to pakistan joined abdullah azzam and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the mujahideen resistance in the soviet war in afghanistan. he later told a journalist: i felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of afghanistan. under operation cyclone from  to  the united states provided financial aid and weapons to the mujahideen through pakistan's isi. bin laden met and built relations with hamid gul who was a three-star general in the pakistani army and head of the isi agency. although the united states provided the money and weapons the training of militant groups was entirely done by the pakistani armed forces and the isi. by  bin laden and azzam established maktab al-khidamat which funneled money arms and fighters from around the arab world into afghanistan. through al-khadamat bin laden's inherited family fortune paid for air tickets and accommodation paid for paperwork with pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihadi fighters. bin laden established camps inside khyber pakhtunkhwa in pakistan and trained volunteers from across the muslim world to fight against the soviet puppet regime the democratic republic of afghanistan. it was during this time that he became idolised by many arabs. formation and structuring of al-qaedamain article: al-qaeda by  bin laden had split from maktab al-khidamat. while azzam acted as support for afghan fighters bin laden wanted a more military role. one of the main points leading to the split and the creation of al-qaeda was azzam's insistence that arab fighters be integrated among the afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force. notes of a meeting of bin laden and others on august   indicate al-qaeda was a formal group by that time: basically an organized islamic faction its goal is to lift the word of god to his religion victorious. a list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability good manners obedience and making a pledge bayat to follow one's superiors. according to wright the group's real name was not used in public pronouncements because its existence was still a closely held secret. his research suggests that al-qaeda was formed at an august   meeting between several senior leaders of egyptian islamic jihad abdullah azzam and bin laden where it was agreed to join bin laden's money with the expertise of the islamic jihad organization and take the jihadist cause elsewhere after the soviets withdrew from afghanistan. following the soviet union's withdrawal from afghanistan in february  osama bin laden returned to saudi arabia in  as a hero jihad who along with his arab legion had brought down the mighty superpower of the soviet union. however he was angry at the outbreak of internecine tribal fighting among the afghans. the iraqi invasion of kuwait under saddam hussein on august   put the saudi kingdom and the house of saud at risk with iraqi forces on the saudi border and saddam's appeal to pan-arabism potentially inciting internal dissent. bin laden met with king fahd and saudi defense minister sultan telling them not to depend on non-muslim assistance from the united states and others offering to help defend saudi arabia with his arab legion. bin laden's offer was rebuffed and the saudi monarchy invited the deployment u.s. forces in saudi territory. bin laden publicly denounced saudi dependence on the u.s. military arguing the two holiest shrines of islam mecca and medina the cities in the prophet mohamed received and recited god's message should only be defended by muslims. bin laden's criticism of the saudi monarchy led them to attempt to silence him. the u.s. 82nd airborne division landed in north-eastern saudi city of dhahran and was deployed in the desert barely  miles from medina. meanwhile on november   the fbi raided the new jersey home of el sayyid nosair an associate of al-qaeda operative ali mohamed discovering copious evidence of terrorist plots including plans to blow up new york city skyscrapers. this marked the earliest discovery of al-qaeda terrorist plans outside of muslim countries. nosair was eventually convicted in connection to the  world trade center bombing and later admitted guilt for the murder of rabbi meir kahane in new york city on november  . bin laden continued to speak publicly against the saudi government for which the saudis banished him. he went to live in exile in sudan in  in a deal brokered by ali mohamed. sudan and return to afghanistanin sudan bin laden established a new base for mujahideen operations in khartoum. he bought a house on al-mashtal street in the affluent al-riyadh quarter and a retreat at soba on the blue nile. during his time in sudan he heavily invested in the infrastructure in agriculture and businesses. he built roads using the same bulldozers he had employed to construct mountain tracks in afghanistan. many of his labourers were the same fighters who had been his comrades in the war against the soviet union. he was generous to the poor and popular with the people. he continued to criticize king fahd of saudi arabia and in response in  fahd stripped bin laden of his saudi citizenship and persuaded his family to cut off his  million a year stipend. by now bin laden was being linked with egyptian islamic jihad eij which made up the core of al-qaeda. in  the eij attempted to assassinate egyptian president hosni mubarak. the attempt failed and the eij was expelled from sudan. the u.s. state department accused sudan of being a sponsor of international terrorism and bin laden himself of operating terrorist training camps in the sudanese desert. sudan therefore began efforts to expel bin laden. the commission report states: in late  when bin laden was still in sudan the state department and the central intelligence agency cia learned that sudanese officials were discussing with the saudi government the possibility of expelling bin laden. cia paramilitary officer billy waugh tracked down bin ladin in the sudan and prepared an operation to apprehend him was denied authorization. u.s. ambassador timothy carney encouraged the sudanese to pursue this course. the saudis however did not want bin laden giving as their reason their revocation of his citizenship. sudan's minister of defense fatih erwa has claimed that sudan offered to hand bin laden over to the united states. the commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. ambassador carney had instructions only to push the sudanese to expel bin laden. ambassador carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the sudanese since at the time there was no indictment outstanding against bin laden in any country. the commission report further states: in february  sudanese officials began approaching officials from the united states and other governments asking what actions of theirs might ease foreign pressure. in secret meetings with saudi officials sudan offered to expel bin laden to saudi arabia and asked the saudis to pardon him. u.s. officials became aware of these secret discussions certainly by march. saudi officials apparently wanted bin laden expelled from sudan. had already revoked his citizenship however and would not tolerate his presence in their country. bin laden may have no longer felt safe in sudan where he had already escaped at least one assassination attempt that he believed to have been the work the egyptian or saudi regimes and paid for by the cia. due to the increasing pressure on sudan from saudi arabia egypt and the united states bin laden was permitted to leave for a country of his choice. he chose to return to jalalabad afghanistan aboard a chartered flight on may   and there forged a close relationship with mullah mohammed omar. despite his ambitions organizational skills when bin laden left sudan he and his organization were significantly weakened. in august  bin laden declared war against the united states. despite the assurance of president george h.w. bush to king fahd in that all u.s. forces based in saudi arabia would be withdrawn once the iraqi threat had been dealt with by the americans were still there citing the continued existence of saddam's regime which bush had chosen not to destroy. bin laden's view was that the evils of the middle east arose from america's attempt to take over the region and from its support for israel. saudi arabia had been turned into an american colony. the fatw was first published in al quds al arabi a london-based newspaper. it was entitled declaration of war against the americans occupying the land of the two holy places. saudi arabia is sometimes called the land of the two holy mosques in reference to mecca and medina the two holiest places in islam. the reference to occupation in the fatw referred to us forces based in saudi arabia for the purpose of controlling air space in iraq known as operation southern watch. in afghanistan bin laden and al-qaeda raised money from donors from the days of the soviet jihad and from the pakistani isi to establish more training camps for mujahideen fighters. bin laden effectively took over ariana afghan airlines which ferried islamic militants arms cash and opium through the united arab emirates and pakistan as well as provided false identifications to members of bin laden's terrorist network. arms smuggler viktor bout helped to run the airline maintaining planes and loading cargo. michael scheuer head of the cia's bin laden unit concluded that ariana was being used as a terrorist taxi service.
