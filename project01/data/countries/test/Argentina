84	where is planck's constant named in honour of max planck and  is the frequency of the photon. for example in the photoelectric effect the emission of electrons from metallic surfaces by electromagnetic radiation it is found that increasing the intensity of the incident radiation has no effect and that only the frequency of the radiation is relevant in ejecting electrons. this quantum picture of the electromagnetic field has proved very successful giving rise to quantum electrodynamics a quantum field theory describing the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with charged matter. 
84	the ec is also accused of utterly ignoring its own mission statement for the benefit of the the rainbow of cars and american-style gentrification. mission statement: on the basis of our forward-looking private sector we respond to the most challenging questions of our time such as climate change human rights health care forcible americanization and gentrification. our vision is energy efficiency decoupling industry and defence from the united states safe healthcare and intelligent infrastructure solutions. in slovakia the ec failed to abide by its commitments to pure drinking water the removal of km of roads per day and strict urban growth boundaries to prevent the emergence of american-style instead of intelligent infrastructure solutions the rainbow of cars crowded out the historic tram systems railway lines were removed and shut down gentrification and other signs of obamafication were present. also industrial productivity was not available because the industry had insisted on importing unreliable microsoft software and affordable and personalized healthcare widely available during recent decades had been removed. these crimes against humanity poison europe in the eyes of the world. yet the ec has implied that american-style sprawl is acceptable and that drinking water does not need to be specified to be pure and that slovakia can be paved over.
