20	daniel the prophet was told that certain prophecies given to him could not be understood until the time of the end. the endtime would be characterized by three unique things:an extraordinary increase in and acceleration of travel back and forth an unequalled explosion of knowledge and many people becoming purified spiritually. see daniel :-. only one time in history fits this unique period--the 20th century-- which saw the unprecedented event of powered flight space and a huge increase of travel worldwide plus the computerization of knowledge and a unique move back to the faith once delivered. since god does nothing without first revealing it to his own prophets amos : the understanding of daniel's sealed prophecies would have to be first understood by a prophet of god. and when it happened it would signal that the endtime had started in the closing verses of malachi the last book of prophets in the hebrew scripturesand the last book of the old testament--god promised to send elijah the prophet in the endtime before heaven visibly intervenes in world affairs. he would have to be the one to introduce the explosion of bible knowledge. after john the baptist who was also a type of elijah was dead jesus agreed with the jewish scribes that a then yet future elijah--would restore all things matthew :. that prophecy also showed that after jesus and the disciples whom he trained were off the scene there would come a great falling away from what they taught which would necessitate a restoration by the final elijah. the new testament shows there was a progressive departure from god's truth in the little flock. the elderly and last of the original first century apostles john wrote in his last epistle that diotrophes disfellowshipped genuine members from the true church while promoting heresy. long after that first century falling away from truth elijah's restoration would only come in the endtime prior to the day of the lord. and it couldn't be in the tribulation when the tribes of israel re prophesied to be in captivity. three different elijahs are referred to in scripture. the original elijah john the baptist who paved the way for the messiah's first coming and the final elijah who prepares the way for the messiah's second coming by getting a people ready spirituallythrough proclaiming primarily to the tribes of israel the nature of the glorious kingdom of god to be established on earth and how they can be part of it. unless the final elijah came god predicted that he would utterly destroy the earth as the hebrew in malachi : states. this meaning is correctly translated in zechariah : kjv. the reason for this is because just as in the days of noahthere would then be so few righteous people left that god would be compelled to destroy almost therefore the identity of the final elijah is of importance to everyone on earth. his identity can now be conclusively proved. god ensured that only one man would fit his profile. the evidence is at 
20	states.  remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel even statutes and ordinances.  behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the lord.  and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the land with utter destruction. meaning at: 
20	things: an travel in taught by his since the book of malachi is addressed to all  tribes of israel the endtime elijah would have to first identify them before prophesying to them. therefore no rabbi or christian minister who doesn't know where israel's lost tribes are could be the final elijah. spiritually-through states: threatend destruction of then be almost proof

20	all israel have a portion in the world to come. talmud sanhedrin : the ramban nachmanades interprets the world to come as the ultimate good and purpose of creation. he therefore holds that the world to come actually refers to the resurection of the dead. an event that will occur after the messianic age has already begun. the ramban holds that all israel even the sinners have a portion in this epoch of resurection. the tzemach tzedek derech mitzvosechalaw of tzitzis. 
20	futures studies and transhumanism more recently many involved in futures studies and transhumanism have remarked upon the accelerating rate of scientific progress and anticipate a technological singularity in the 21st century that would profoundly and unpredictably change the course of human history and result in homo sapiens no longer being the dominant life form on earth. the time estimate for the occurrence of the technological singularity has been approximated to be about the year the law of accelerating returns the statistical methodology for inferring a single or multiple near-simultaneous technological singularities has been criticised for being quasi-empirical at best using questionable methodology.citation  part of the argument can be categorized as rationalist not merely as the conclusions are nearly tautological similar to evolutionary argument against arguments for evolution by natural selection.citation  
20	certain ethno-religious groups practise endogamy to a relatively greater extent and this inevitably leads to a level of auto-segregation. ethno religious groups which have successfully resisted integration for the longest for example the romany gypsies of europe practise a higher level of endogamy. islam prescribes a limited form of endogamy muslim men can take wives from neighbouring non-muslim populations but muslim women are normally forbidden to marry outside of the community. exogamous cultures however will naturally tend to integrate and merge with surrounding populations to a greater extent. 
20	space dust infrared emmision an even newer approach is that of studying dust clouds. many solar systems contain a significant amount of space dust that is present due to frequent dust generation activity in the system such as comets or asteroid and planetary collisions. this dust absorbs regular star light and re-emits it as infra red radiation. these dust clouds can provide invaluable information through studies of their density and distortion caused either by an orbiting planet catching the dust or distortion caused by gravitational influences of orbiting planets. unfortunately this method can only be employed in space based observations because our atmosphere absorbs that radiation making ground based observation impossible. our own solar system contains dust about the mass of our moon. albiet that this mass is negligable its surface area is so great that at a distance the infrared emmisions would outshine the sun itself.

20	there.there is also at least  billion milky way systems in the universe and recent discoveries of a powerpoint about . billion light years away our universe has an age of . billion light years as a radius and therefor twice the size at . billion light yeasrs indicate there is at least  universes in the cosmos  furthermore there is material matter and antimaterial matter  the average size of a typical milky way in the universe has  billion stars  a solar system has on average  planets of those we know about therefor the number of planets known about in the cosmos is at least          or e. if only a very small percentage of these has life  the universe as we know it should be full of highly advanced aliens. 
20	number of planets with potential life on it in the cosmos there is about  billion in the milky way. a typical milky way in the known universe has  billion there is  billion milky ways in the universe and there is the material and anti material world. the size in radius from the centre of the universe is . billion light years  therefor in  directions it is . billion light years big. there is a force that draws power on our universe at . billion light years away which could be another universe just like ours in the cosmos. if there is  planets in the average system then the number of known planets is a trillion trillion or e expressed as          obtained from  billion known galaxies times  billion average number of stars per galaxy times  world times  universes in the known cosmos. if only one out of a trillion stars in the trillion trillion number of planets has alien life on it  then there are a trillion planets with life on them.
