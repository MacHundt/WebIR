44	living organisms thus survive because of exchange of energy within and without with the exchange always acting in a direction to increase the entropy of the universe as a whole. i.e. if the entropy of an organism decreases the entropy of the left over energy from sunlight must increase even more. nearly all transformations of energy in biology ultimately derive from the entropy-driven transformation of sunlight into heat see photosynthesis. in a living organism chemical bonds are constantly broken and made to make the exchange and transformation of energy possible. these chemical bonds are most often bonds in carbohydrates including sugars. other chemical bonds include bonds in adenosine and acetate which in turn is derived from fats and oils. these molecules along with oxygen are common stores of concentrated energy for biological processes. when they react to form new molecules with even stronger bonds such as carbon dioxide and water they evolve heat. when this heat diffuses away it supplies the net diffusion of energy entropy increase which is necessary by the second law of thermodynamics to make up for the local concentration of energy entropy decrease which occurs in anabolic processes as organisms grow or evolve. meteorology the earth's weather patterns including energy-releasing processes like lightning hurricanes snow avalanches and floods are all powered ultimately by the energy of sunlight striking the earth. although this amount varies a little each year as a result of solar flares solar and the sunspot cycle it has been estimated that the average total solar incoming radiation or insolation is  watts per square meter incident to the summit of the atmosphere at the equator at midday a figure known as the solar constant. some  of this is immediately reflected by the planetary albedo as a result of clouds snowfields and even reflected light from water rock or vegetation. as more energy is received in the tropics that is re-radiated whilst more energy is radiated at the poles than is received climatic homeostasis is only maintained by a transfer of energy from the tropics to the poles. this transfer of energy is what drives the winds and the ocean currents. like biological processes weather processes involve turning energy from a concentrated form such as sunlight i.e. heat radiation which occurs at the temperature of the sun and therefore is concentrated into a few photons ultimately into a less concentrated form such as far infrared radiation i.e. heat radiation at the much smaller characteristic temperatures that occur on earth and thus is diffused into many photons. however energy may be temporarily locally stored during this process and the sudden release of such stored sources are responsible for the most dramatic processes mentioned above. geology: volcanos earthquakes landslides and tsunamis are all results of similar sudden releases of stored energy in the crust of earth. the source of this energy is heat slowly released through the crust from the energy production of the earth as a whole. recent studies suggest that the earth produces about . x  watts per kilogram. given the earth's mass of about . x  kilograms this means that the earth is producing about  x  watts of energy per year. from the study of neutrinos radiated from the earth see kamland scientists have recently estimated that about  terawatts of this energy comes from radioactive decay principally of potassium  thorium  and uranium  with the remaining . terawatts coming from energies produced by the continuing gravitational sorting of the core and mantle of the earth energies left over from the history of the of the earth about . billion years ago. both energies decline over time and based on half-life alone it has been estimated that the current energy of the planet represents less than  of that which was available at the time the planet formed. as a result geological forces of accretion accretion subduction and sea floor spreading which release up to  of this available energy were more active in the archaean and proterozoic periods than they are today. the remaining  of geological tectonic energy comes through hotspots produced by mantle plumes resulting in shield volcanoes like hawaii geyser activity like yellowstone or flood basalts like iceland. tectonic process driven by heat from the earth's interior metamorphose weathered rocks and during orogeny periods lift them up into mountain ranges. the potential energy represented by the mountain range's weight and height thus represents heat from the core of the earth which has been partly transformed into graviational potential energy. this potential energy may be suddenly released in landslides or megatsunamis. similarly the energy release which drives an earthquake represents stresses in rocks that are mechanical potential energy which has been similarly stored from tectonic processes. the remaining energy which drives the geological processes of erosion and deposition are a result of the interaction of solar energy and gravity. an estimated  of the total insolation is used to drive the water cycle. when water vapour condenses to fall as rain it disolves small amounts of carbon dioxide making a weak acid. this acid acting upon the metallic silicates that form most rocks produces chemical weathering removing the metals and leading to the production of rocks and sand carried by wind and water downslope through gravity to be depositied at the edge of continents in the sea. weathering of rocks is produced by the expansion of ice crystals left by water in the joint planes of rocks. a geologic cycle is continued when these eroded rocks are later uplifted into mountains. physical all stellar phenomena including of course solar activity are driven by various forms of energy release and diffusion. the source of this energy is ultimately derived either from gravitational collapse of matter which was distributed in the big bang or else from fusion of lighter elements primarily hydrogen created in the big bang. these light elements were spread too fast and too thinnly in the big bang process see nucleosynthesis to be able to form the most stable and low-energy kinds of atoms which have medium-sized atomic nuclei like iron and nickel. the later formation of such atoms powers the energy-releasing reaction in stars. forms of energy and relations between different forms  in the context of natural sciences energy has different forms: thermal chemical electrical radiant nuclear etc. they can all be in fact reduced to kinetic energy or potential energy. thus energy can be divided into two broad categories.  according to kinetic theory the microscopic thermal energies of the particles in a gas comprise the internal energy of a system. by the equipartition theorem each degree of freedom of a particle has an associated energy such that the energy per particle is proportional to temperature. for a monatomic gas having n particles each with three degrees of freedom the internal energy is: :where k is the boltzmann constant and t is absolute temperature. whereas all internal energy is kinetic in an ideal gas in solids half of it is stored in electromagnetic potential energy between particles. thermal internal energy is present in all macroscopic objects in the universe. although some heat transfer is mediated by the kinetic energy of a system's constituent particles this kinetic energy exhibits brownian motion a highly disorganized state.  radiation energy also known as light energy is the energy of electromagnetic radiation. it is carried in equal amounts in electric and magnetic fields. it is quantized and the spacing between allowed levels is called a photon. a quantum of energy of the electromagnetic field energy of a photon is equal to: math!ekr where f is the frequency of the photon and h is the planck's constant. photons move at the speed of light and carry energy and momentum. because energy or momentum can code information photons can be used to transfer information see fiber optics as an example. potential energy is stored unreleased energy a positive quantity like monetary savings or else required energy like monetary debt. this sort of energy may be positive or negative because it can represent work done on a system against a restoring force or work done by a system as a force result. negative energy is a mathematical construct in reference to another system. for instance using the power of a compressed spring to launch a dart uses the elastic potential energy stored within the spring. when the spring is released this energy is converted into kinetic energy and work is performed. there is a form of potential energy for each of the four basic forces in nature: gravity electromagnetic and strong and weak nuclear forces. gravitational potential energy is the work of gravitational force during rearrangement of mutual positions of interacting masses  say when masses are moved apart such as when a crate is lifted or closer together as when a meteorite falls to earth. if the masses of the objects are considered point masses this work thus the gravitational potential energy is equal to: mathepg   gmm over r where m and m are the two masses in question r is the distance between them and g is the gravitational constant. in case of small displacement h  r the above formula results in widely used e  mgh approximation. electric potential energy is the work of electric forces during rearrangement of positions of charges and also includes the common chemical potential energies energy required to break chemical bonds or obtained from forming them. the energy released in lightning or from burning a litre of fuel oil are some common kinds of electromagnetic potential energy !--rubber band is actually not a good illustration of potential energy: see talk--. electromagnetic potential energy is equal to: mathepe  q q over piepsilon where q and q are the electric charges on the objects in question r is the distance between them and  is the electric constant of a vacuum. magnetic potential energy is energy stored in a magnetic field and is related to the relative motion of electric charges. it is related to electric potential energy and is considered a form of it since both types of potential are mediated by the electromagnetic field. magnetic potential energy is most familar as the type of energy storage which allows transfer of power within an electrical transformer.  thermal thermal energy is the part of thermal energy stored in deformation of atomic bonds during thermal motion of atoms as atoms oscillate around position of equilibrium they not only have kinetic energy of motion but also potential energy of displacement from equilibrium. this energy is significant portion of thermal energy for strongly bonded systems solids and liquids and practically nonexistent for gasses.  chemical chemical energy is the energy stored in the bonds of chemical structures. it is released or formed in chemical reactions.  elastic elastic energy is the energy stored in the elastic nature of objects. in the ideal case of hooke's law the energy is equal to: math!epe  frac k where k is the spring constant dependant on the individual spring and x is the deformation of the object. nuclear potential energy along with electric potential energy provides the energy released from nuclear fission and nuclear fusion processes. in both cases nuclear forces act to bind nuclear particles more strongly and closely after the reaction has completed nuclear particles like protons and neutrons are not destroyed in fission and fusion processes but collections of them have less mass than if they were individually free. weak nuclear forces provide the potential energy for certain kinds of radioactive decay such as beta decay.ultimately the energy released in nuclear processes is so large that the change in mass is noticeable too: math!e  delta m where m is the amount of rest mass released into the surroundings as active energy heat light kinetic energy and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. energy is subject to the law of conservation of energy which is a mathematical restatement of shift symmetry of time. thus energy cannot be made or destroyed it can only be converted from one form to another that is transformed. in practice during any energy transformation in macroscopic system some energy is converted into incoherent microscopic motion of parts of the system which is usually called heat or thermal motion and the entropy of the system increases. due to mathematical impossibility to invert this process see statistical mechanics the energy of energy conversion in a macroscopic system is always less than . the first law of thermodynamics states that the total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system plus the change in the energy contained within the system. in other words energy is neither created nor destroyed only converted between forms. this law is used in all branches of physics but frequently violated for short enough periods of time during which energy can not be mathematically defined yet see quantum electrodynamics and off shell concept. noether's theorem relates the conservation of energy to the time invariance of physical laws. the law of conservation of energy a fundamental principle of physics follows from the translational symmetry of time a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. put differently yesterday today and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. the fact that energy can not be defined for arbitrary short periods of time in quantum mechanics follows from the definition of energy operator which results mathematically in the mutual uncertainty of time and energy known as the heisenberg uncertainty principle: : mathdelta e delta t ge despite being seemingly insignificant this principle has profound impact on processes in our universe. it results in the existence of virtual particles which carry momentum exchange by which with real particles is responsible for creation of all known fundamental forces more accurately known as fundamental interactions. virtual photons which are simply lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons are also responsible for spontaneous radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states for the casimir force for van der vaals bond forces and some other observable phenomena. conversion of energy into different forms as a consequence of energy conservation law one form of energy can often be readily transformed into another  for instance a battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy. similarly gravitational potential energy is converted into the kinetic energy of moving water and a turbine in a dam which in turn is transformed into electric energy by a generator. in all cases as long as no energy is allowed to escape from the system the sum of all the different energies in the system remains constant no matter how many changes take place. an example is a chemical explosion in which chemical potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and heat in a very short time. another example of the conversion and conservation of energy is a pendulum. at its highest points the kinetic energy is zero and the gravitational potential energy is at its maximum. at its lowest point the kinetic energy is at its maximum and is equal to the decrease of potential energy. if one unrealistically assumes that there is no friction the energy will be conserved and the pendulum will continue swinging forever. in practice available energy is rarely perfectly conserved when a system changes state in large systems consisting of many atoms some energy will be converted into useless non-available energies such as those associated with heat. this fraction however may be reduced arbitrarily toward zero. in large systems with little friction such as a planet orbiting its sun motion may continue nearly indefinitely because useable energy is traded between usable kinetic and potential energies with so little conversion into heat. in small systems such the atom or in a vibrating molecule where there may be no friction associated with the motion of electrons or the mututal vibration of nuclei the possibility of indefinite motion with perpetual conversion of kinetic and potential energy is the case. while energy in forms other than heat may be freely converted to other forms including into heat with efficiency approaching or even equaling  once energy has been converted into heat there are severe limitations in re converting this energy into other useful forms and efficiency never reaches . if this were not so the creation of certain kinds of perpetual motion machines those which evolve heat but use that heat to continue running would be possible. heat therefore deserves to be placed in a special class of energy which has been degraded by giving it access to all parts of a system. while most heat consists of kinetic and potential energies associated with atomic motion or with certain kinds of radiant energy i.e. electromagnetic energy with a blackbody spectrum the energy associated with heat is in a diffused and non-direction form in which the energy has spread out to occupy all of the possible states of a system which can store it. this happens at a certain equilibrium temperature where temperature is a measure of energy concentration in a system. when all parts of a system reach the same temperature the energy of heat cannot be directed into particular other kinds of energy or used to do work unless the system is enlarged in some fashion which allows the heat is allowed to diffuse into a particular direction in which it is even less concentrated such as when the heat is allowed to flow to a region of lower temperature. thus we see that heat is energy which has already reached a sort of minimal concentration or diffusion in the system it is in and is useless for doing any kind of work unless the system is opened in such a way as to let the heat have access to a larger system. energy is always conserved in closed systems if heat is taken into account. but the amount of useful energy is usually not conserved since once energy is converted to heat it loses some of its ability to do work and therefore its ability to be convertible to other kinds of energy. the si unit of measurement for energy is the joule. of unitsenergy or work because energy is defined in terms of work a definition of work is crucial to the understanding of energy. work is a defined as a line integral of force f over distance s: : math w  int mathbff cdot the equation above says that the work is equal to the integral of the dot product of the force on a body and the infinitesimal of the body's translation depending on the kind of force f involved work of this force results in corresponding kind of energy gravitational electrostatic kinetic etc. for example the gravitational force f-mg acting on a mass m when the mass is elevated from some height h reference height to the height h is therefore: : w  mgh  h mgh  mgh and we call this work by the term gravitational potential energy u  mgh. similar work by the force f  ma to accelerate a bullet from zero velocity to the velocity v is : math w  int mathbff cdot mathrmdmathbfs  int m mathbfa cdot mathrmdmathbfs  and we call this work by the term kinetic energy k  other forms of energy are similarly defined via work. energy in the economy image:energy per consumption per capita per country . red hues indicate increase green hues decrease of consumption during the 1990s. in the context of economics the word energy is synonymous to list of energy resources it refers to substances like fuels petroleum products and electric power installations. this difference vis a vis energy in natural sciences can lead to some confusion because energy resources are not conserved in nature in the same way as the energy is conserved in the context of say physics. people often talk about energy crisis and the need to conserve energy something contrary to the spirit of natural sciences. what is actually meant is conservation of useful energy which can be converted into other forms. thus energy and energy of energy is very important to the global economy. all economic activity therefore require energy whether to goods provide feed electricity into computers and other machines or to grow food to feed workers or even to harvest new fuels. the way in which humans use energy is one of the defining characteristics of an economy. the progression from animal power to steam power then the internal combustion engine and electricity are key elements in the development of modern civilization. scarcity of cheap fuels pollution and global warming are key concerns in future energy development.

44	on december   members of the basque group eta shot dead a spanish civil guard and seriously wounded another in southern france. it is the first fatality blamed on eta in nearly a year. the two plainsclothes civil guard officers were in capbreton france to meet with french police about joint operations against eta which traditionally uses france as a base for its attacks in spain. the civil guards were shot as they emerged from a place where they regularly have breakfast. three eta suspects fled in a car later leaving it to commandeer a second car. 
44	pope john paul ii's view on evil over the years i have become more and more convinced that the ideologies of evil are profoundly rooted in the history of european philosophical thought the cogito ergo sum i think therefore i am radically changed the way of doing philosophy. in the pre-cartesian period philosophy that is to say the cogito or rather the cognosco was subordinate to esse which was considered prior. to descartes however the esse seemed secondary and he judged the cogito to be prior. this not only changed the direction of philosophizing but it marked the decisive abandonment of what philosophy had been hitherto particularly the philosophy of saint thomas aquinas namely the philosophy of esse according to the logic of cogito ergo sum god was reduced to an element within human consciousness no longer could he be considered the ultimate explanation of the human sum extracted from memory and identity 
44	perhaps evil is best represented in the human situation in the form of unprovoked hatred against and coupled with an aggressive impulse to cause harm to another person or group. such hatred can be aroused from within the individual or group through jealousy wrong religious teachings or due to unexplained extra-personal forces.
