91	entropy is a function related to both thermal energy density and thermal energy distribution. for example simply adding heat to a system increases its entropy. in such a system the temperature and pressure might remain the same if for instance only a phase change occurred e.g. liquid water evaporating into water vapor but the entropy would increase. entropy is a measure of the thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for doing mechanical work. as another example consider an isolated system with different regions at different temperatures. a heat engine could be added and mechanical work extracted from such a system. if instead the heat was allowed to freely flow from the warmer regions to the cooler regions and the system allowed reach thermal equilibrium and a uniform intermediate temperature then the entropy would have increased such that the entropy times that intermediate temperature would equal the thermal energy and then none of the thermal energy would then be available to do mechanical work. 
91	concurrency and distribution oriented language there is also built-in support for distributed processes. processes may be created on remote nodes and comunication with them is transparent i.e. the communication with remote processes is done exactly as the communication with local processes. pid  spawnnode mod func args  execute function func in remote node node 
91	the process eroding or being eroded by wind water or other natural agents: the problem of soil erosion.soil erosion by water wind and tillage affects both agriculture and the natural environment. soil loss and its associated impacts is one of the most important yet probably the least well-known of today's environmental problems. soil is the earths fragile skin that anchors all life on earth. it is comprised of countless species that create a dynamic and complex ecosystem and is among the most precious resources to humans. increased demand for agriculture commodities generates incentives to convert forests and grasslands to farm fields and pastures. the transition to agriculture from natural vegetation often cannot hold onto the soil and many of these plants such as coffee cotton palm oil soybean and wheat can actually increase soil erosion beyond the soils ability to maintain itself. half of the topsoil on the planet has been lost the last  years. addition to soil quality affected other aspects of agriculture. these compaction loss of soil structure nutrient degradation and soil salinity. these are very real and at times severe issues. the effects of soil erosion go beyond the loss of fertile land. it has led to increased pollution and sedimentation streams and rivers clogging these waterways and causing declines in fish and other species. and degraded lands are also often less able to hold onto water which can worsen flooding. sustainable land use can help to reduce the impacts of agriculture and livestock preventing soil degradation and erosion and the loss of valuable land to desertification. the health of soil is a primary concern to farmers and the global community whose livelihoods depend managed agriculture that starts with the dirt beneath our feet. while challenges to maintaining healthy soil solutions a dedicated group of people including wwf who work to innovate maintain fragile skin biodiversity springs.
