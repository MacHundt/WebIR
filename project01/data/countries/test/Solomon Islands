94	in the churches it was for centuries the custom for the priest to read an exhortation to the congregation telling them in advance of a coming celebration during the celebration itself a further exhortation was read. the priest exhorted those coming to the sacrament was available to those who who truly repent of their sins are in love and charity with their neighbours and intend to lead a new life following the commandments of god. before receiving the sacrament the communicant was to make his or her name known to the priest who was going to preside. in the past  years or so this pattern has largely fallen into disuse. preparation for communion for the latter half of the 19th century until nearly the end of the 20th century included fasting before communion either from midnight the day before or upon waking. many throughout the world still follow the custom of fasting. before the 1970s, many anglo-catholics routinely made their private confession to the priest usually on saturday afternoons as the ancient exhortations encouraged private confession before communion. nowadays preparation is usually up to the individual. many individuals families small groups prepare for the sunday eucharist by studying the scriptural lessons appointed in the lectionary for the next sunday holy day or feast or week day they will be receiving. many will still avail themselves of sacramental confession. however most people understand the first half of the eucharist as the prepartion for the reception of the body and blood of christ. the lessons from the bible the sermon creed prayers and the peace before the priest who in the name of the church offers to god the great thanksgiving for the consecration of the gifts. all this is a preparation though clergy and lay people still admonish each other to be at peace with each other and to come expectantly to the throne of grace.
