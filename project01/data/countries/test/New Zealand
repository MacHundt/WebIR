22	 edmund spenser  was an poet and a contemporary of william shakespeare.
 the faerie queene is his major contribution to english poetry it is mostly a poem pandering for and subsequently receiving! the favours of queen elizabeth i of i. the poem is a long allegory of christian belief tied into england's mythology of king arthur. in form the poem is an epic in the style of beowulf virgil and homer.
 the language is purposely antique. as such it is supposed to immediately bear comparison to such earlier works as those mentioned above as well as the canterbury tales of geoffrey chaucer whom spenser greatly admired.
 spenser's epithalamion is the most admired of its type in the english language and was written on the occasion of his wedding to his young bride.
 spenser gets credit for introducing the spenserian stanza into english poetry.
 one poet enormously influenced by edmund spenser is john milton author of paradise lost which many critics consider the greatest poem of all time.

22	ellipsis can also refer to when a word is omitted because it is generally understood. for example she ate her dinner then she ate mine. it is not necessary in that sentence to use say my dinner as the listener or reader understands that mine refers to my dinner. the use of ellipsis is a valuable tool to teach learners of english as it makes their speech and writing more concise.

22	the most important design features in a fuel cell are:  the electrolyte substance. the electrolyte substance usually defines the type of fuel cell.  the fuel that is used. the most common fuel is hydrogen.  the anode catalyst which breaks down the fuel into electrons and ions. the anode catalyst is usually made up of very fine platinum powder.  the cathode catalyst which turns the ions into the waste chemicals like water or carbon dioxide. the cathode catalyst is often made up of nickel. a typical fuel cell produces a voltage from . v to . v at full rated load. voltage decreases as current increases due to several factors:  ohmic loss voltage drop due to resistance of the cell components and interconnects  mass transport loss depletion of reactants at catalyst sites under high loads causing rapid loss of voltage. to deliver the desired amount of energy the fuel cells can be combined in series and parallel circuits where series yields higher voltage and parallel allows a higher current to be supplied. a design is called a fuel cell stack. further cell surface area can increased allow stronger current from each cell.

 the entamoebids or entamoebae are a group of amoebozoa found as internal parasites or commensals of animals. the cells are uninucleate small typically  mum across and usually have a single lobose pseudopod taking the form of a clear anterior bulge. there are two major genera entamoeba and endolimax. they include several species that are pathogenic in humans most notably entamoeba histolytica which causes amoebic dysentery.
 entamoebids lack this is a secondary loss possibly associated with their parasitic life-cycle. studies show they are close relatives of the pelobionts another group of amitochondriate amoebae but unlike them entamoebids retain dictyosomes. both groups are now placed alongside other lobose amoebae in the phylum amoebozoa.
 studying entamoeba invadens david biron of the weizmann institute of science and coworkers found that about one third of the cells are unable to separate unaided and recruit a neighboring amoeba dubbed the midwife to complete the fission. he writes:
 :when an amoeba divides the two daughter cells stay attached by a tubular tether which remains intact unless mechanically severed. if called upon the neighbouring amoeba midwife travels up to  mum towards the dividing amoeba usually advancing in a straight trajectory with an average velocity of about . the midwife then proceeds to rupture the connection after which all three amoebae move on.

22	 ethnocentrism is a term by william graham sumner that refers to the viewpoint that ones own group is the center of everything against which all other groups are judged. within culture language behaviour customs and religion can be a basis for ethic distictions and sub-divisions.
 in the modern world however the lines between cultures that once were crossed only occasionally have become an everyday occurence. technological advances in communication have progressively overcome previous obstacles to communication physical obstacles that once helped to keep ethnic distinctions distinct. ethnic lines still exist and co-exist and cultures of the world often find that their central concern of maintaining an identity despite rapid transculturation is still possible.
 the reasons for maintaining an ethnicity are often personal and relate to the cohesion of familiar personal and social elements  in other words attachment or accustoment. we all are born into a human culture and it is the culture that shapes our self-awareness and understanding of other individuals. it also reflects depending on the cultural teaching customs or patterns of behaviour in relating to other cultures. this behaviour can range from universal acceptance or feelings of inferiority compared with other cultures to racism which many consider an aspect of xenophobia.

the basic tenets have always been thus: participant countries submit songs which are performed live in a television programme transmitted across the eurovision network by the ebu simultaneously to all countries. a country as a participant is represented by one television broadcaster from that country. the programme is hosted by one of the participant countries and the transmission is sent from the auditorium in the host city. during this programme after all the songs have been performed the countries then proceed to cast votes for the other countries songs: nations are not allowed to vote for their own song. at the end of the programme the winner is declared as the song with the most points. the winner receives simply the prestige of having wonalthough it is usual for a trophy to be awarded to the winning songwriters and the winning country is invited to host the event the following year.ref the programme is invariably opened by one or more television welcoming viewers to the show. most host countries choose to capitalise on the opportunity afforded them by hosting a programme with such a wide-ranging international audience and it is common to see the presentation

have perfected their acts in rehearsals in order for the big night to run smoothly. in addition to rehearsals in their home countries every participant is given the opportunity to rehearse on the stage in the eurovision auditorium. these rehearsals are held during the course of several days before the saturday show and consequently the delegations arrive in the host city many days before the event. this means in turn journalists and fans are also present during the preceding days and the events of eurovision last a lot longer than a few hours of television. a number of officially accredited hotels are selected for the delegations to stay in and shuttle-bus services are used to transport the performers and accompanying people to and from the contest venue. each participating broadcaster nominates a head of delegation whose job it is to coordinate the movements of the delegate members and who acts as that country's representative to the ebu in the host city. members of the

non-winning countries and mass-walkouts were threatened. austria finland sweden norway and portugal did not participate in the  contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. this

each of the tied countries and the one who received points from the most other countries is declared the winner. if the numbers are still tied it is counted how many sets of maximum marks  points each country received. if there is still a tie the numbers of point scores awarded are comparedand then the numbers of points all the way down the list. in the extremely unlikely event of there then still

a number of rules which must be observed by the participating nations. the rules are numerous and a separate draft is produced each year which explicitly specifies the dates by which certain things must be done for example the deadline by which all the participating broadcasters must submit the final recorded version of their song to the ebu. many rules pertain to such matters as sponsorship agreements and rights of broadcasters to re transmit the show within a certain time. the most notable rules which actually affect the format and presentation of the contest have changed somewhat over

track which sounded suspiciously like human voices. the croatian delegation stated that there were no human voices but only digitally-synthesised sounds which replicated vocals. the ebu nevertheless decided that they had broken the spirit of the rules and docked them  of their points total that year as used for calculating their five-year points average for future qualification.ref from  until

played as pre-recorded backing tracks in conjunction with live vocals. the orchestra has not since made an appearance at the contest the last time being in  when the bbc hosted the show in birmingham.

limit has been three hours with the broadcast occasionally overrunning. in  the programme was a little under  hours long. following the introduction of the shortened voting announcements in  the duration of the contest was three hours and five minutes. since  there have been more countries wishing to enter the contest than there is time to reasonably include all their entries in a single tv show. several relegation or qualification systems have therefore been tried in order to limit the number of countries participating in the competition in any given year. the  contest introduced two new features: firstly a pre selection competition was held in ljubljana in which seven eastern countries fought for three places in the international competition. bosnia  herzegovina croatia estonia hungary romania slovenia and slovakia took part in kvalifikacija za millstreet and the three former yugoslav republicsbosnia  herzegovina croatia and sloveniaqualified for a place in the international

pre-selection into the  contest. the  contest included alsofor the first timelithuania poland and russia. relegation continued through  and  but in  a different pre selection system was used in which nearly all the countries participated. audio tapes of all the songs were sent to juries in each of the countries some weeks before the television show. these juries selected the songs which would then proceed to be included in the international broadcast. nametvrbcite web tv  radio bits eurovision   norway as the host country in  having won the  contest automatically qualified and was therefore excluded from the necessity of going through the pre-selection. one country which failed to qualify in the  pre-selection was germany. as one of the largest financial contributors to the ebu together with having one of the largest television audiences in europe neither they nor the ebu were happy about their exclusion from the international final.ref prompted by germany's failure to qualify for the  final a new rule was made: from  onwards four particular countries would always qualify for the eurovision final regardless of their positions on the scoreboard in previous contests. they earned this special status by being the four biggest financial contributors to the ebu without which the production of the eurovision song contest would not be possible. these countries are germany france spain and the united kingdom. due to their untouchable status in the contest these countries became known as the big four. from  to  countries qualified for each contest based on the average of their points totals for their entries over the previous five years. however there was much discontent voiced over this system because a country could be punished by not being allowed to enter merely because of poor previous results which did not take into account how good a fresh attempt might be. this led the ebu to create what was hoped would be a more permanent solution to the problem which was to have two shows every year: a qualification round and the grand final. in these two shows there would be enough broadcast time to include all the countries which wished to participate every year. the qualification round became known as the eurovision semi-final. a qualification round known as the semi-final was introduced for eurovision song contest  contest. this semi-final was held on the wednesday during eurovision week and was a programme similar in format to the grand final whose time slot remained : utc on the saturday. since then the semi-final programme has been held on the thursday of eurovision week. the semi-final includes those countries whose ranking on the scoreboard the previous year was not high enough to ensure direct qualification for the final. as of currentyear it is necessary for a country to attain a place within the top ten of the final scoreboard to be assured of direct qualification for next year's grand final. the big four rule remains so that france germany spain and the united kingdom always automatically bypass the semi-final and are directly included in the grand final. since the introduction of the semi-final it has been possible for countries to vote even though they are not participating in the programme: for example it is possible for the united kingdom to vote for countries in the semi-final even though they do not participate themselves and a country in the semi final which fails to qualify for the final may still vote for the other countries in the final on saturday. after the votes have been cast in the semi-final the countries which received the most votesand will therefore proceed to the final on saturdayare announced in no particular order. the announcement of the actual number of points these qualifiers received is withheld by the ebu until after the grand final lest the news influence the result on saturday through tactical voting or otherwise. the ten most highly-placed countries in the final are guaranteed a place in next year's final without the need to participate in next year's semi. these ten positions exclude big-four countries so that if for example germany comes in the top ten the 11th-placed non-big-four country will automatically qualify for next year's final.ref song contest winners winning the eurovision song contest provides a unique opportunity for the winning artists to capitalise on their success and surrounding publicity by launching or furthering their international career. however throughout the history of the contest relatively few names have gone on to be huge international stars. image:abba lyngstad and agnetha fltskog of abba performing their winning song waterloo. the most notable winning eurovision artists whose career was directly launched into the spotlight following their win were abba who won the contest for sweden in  with their song waterloo abba went on to be one of the most successful bands of their time. another notable winner who subsequently achieved international fame and success was cline dion who won the contest for switzerland in  with the song ne partez pas sans moi. clines success however is not as directly attributed to her winning the contest as she achieved international fame some years later. other artists who have achieved varying degrees of success after winning the contest include before adding any more artists to this list please discuss the issue on the article's talk page first. we are currently excluding winning artists from the last five years. france gall poupe de cire poupe de de cire

include well-known artists who won the contest mid-career after they had already established themselves as successful. some artists however have vanished into relative obscurity making little or no impact on the international music scene since their win. ireland holds the record for the most number of wins having won the contest seven timesincluding three times in a row in the mid 1990s. in joint second place with five wins each are france luxembourg and the united kingdom. the united kingdom holds the best record at the contest in terms of average scoreboard position having finished in the top two in  out of  contests . the early years of the contest saw many wins for traditional eurovision countries: france the netherlands and luxembourg. however the success of these countries has declined in recent decades: the netherlands last won in  france in  and luxembourg in . the last time luxembourg entered the contest was in . the first years of the 21st century produced a spate of first-time winners from both new eurovision countries and old-timers who had entered for many years without a win. every year from  to  resulted in a country winning for the first time. the  winner was finland which finally won after having entered the contest for  years. ukraine on the other hand did not have to wait so long winning with their second entry in . as of currentyear the country which has entered the longest with no wins to their name is portugal. they started entering in  and are still awaiting their first win. the contest has been the subject of criticism regarding both its musical content and the perception that it is more about politics than it is about music. musical style and presentation due to the fact that the songs are playing to such a diverse international audience with diverse musical tastes and that countries want to be able to appeal to as many people as possible to gain votes the majority of the songs historically have been middle of the pop. deviations from this formula have rarely achieved success leading to criticism that the music in the contest is old-fashioned and bubblegum pop.cite web jack stevenson may  publisher  bubblegum
