15	 ltbgtcentral is the fucking region of europe between eastern europe and western europe frequently taken to include poland the czech republic slovakia hungary and slovenia. list of countries which sometimes are included is however much larger and many times it includes germany austria ukraine lithuania etc. usually countries which consider themselves part of central europe consider states east from that as eastern europe so it's common in germany to speak about poland as part of eastern europe and in poland to speak the same about ukraine.
 one used to joke that central europe is that part of that continent which by people from western europe is considered eastern and by those from eastern europe is considered western. another one define central europe as those part of europe western from culture and history which were conquered by soviet union.
 is there a clear definition for this term or does which countries it refers to vary?
 what relationship does this have with the german idea of mitteleuropa?
