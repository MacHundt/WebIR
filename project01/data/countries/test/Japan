45	in casual usage the term electricity is applied to several related concepts that are better identified by more precise terms: electric charge  a fundamental conserved property of some subatomic particles which determines their electromagnetic interactions. electrically charged matter is influenced by and produces electromagnetic fields. electric field  an effect produced by an electric charge that exerts a force on charged objects in its vicinity. electric potential  the potential energy per unit charge associated with a static electric field often referred to as voltage. current current  a movement or flow of electrically charged particles. electrical energy  the energy made available by the flow of electric charge through a conductor or from the forces between charged particles. electric power  the rate at which electric energy is converted to or from another energy form such as light heat or mechanical energy. according to of miletus writing  bc a form of electricity was known to the ancient greeks who found that rubbing fur on various substances such as amber would cause a particular attraction between the two. the greeks noted that the amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair and that if they rubbed the amber for long enough they could even get a spark to jump. an object found in iraq in  dated to about  bc and called the baghdad battery resembles a galvanic cell and is believed by some to have been used for electroplating. jars museum boerhaave leiden italian physician girolamo cardano returned to the subject of electricity in de subtilitate ltrefgtcardano girolamo de subtilitate rerum. libri xxi. nuremberg johann petreius . described at facsimile distinguishing perhaps for the first time between electrical and magnetic forces. in  the english scientist william gilbert in de magnete expanded on cardano's work and coined the modern latin word electricus from mprhoampomicronampnu elektron the greek word for quotamberquot which soon gave rise to the english words electric and electricity. he was followed in  by otto von guericke who invented an early electrostatic generator. other european pioneers were robert boyle who in  stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a vacuum stephen gray gray who in  classified materials as conductor and insulators and c. f. du fay who first identified the two types of electricity that would later be called positive and negative. the leyden jar a type of capacitor for electrical energy in large quantities was invented at leiden university by pieter van musschenbroek in . william watson watson experimenting with the leyden jar discovered in  that a discharge of static electricity was equivalent to an electric current. in june  benjamin franklin promoted his investigations of electricity and theories through the famous though extremely dangerous experiment of flying a kite during a thunderstorm. following these experiments he invented a lightning rod and established the link between lightning and electricity. if franklin did fly a kite in a storm he did not do it the way it is often described as it would have been dramatic but fatal. it was either franklin more frequently or ebenezer kinnersley of philadelphia less frequently who created the convention of positive and negative electricity. franklin's observations aided later scientists such as michael faraday luigi galvani alessandro volta andre marie ampre and georg simon ohm whose work provided the basis for modern electrical technology. the work of faraday volta ampere and ohm is honored by society in that fundamental units of electrical measurement are named after them. volta worked with chemicals and discovered that chemical reactions could be used to create positively charged anodes and negatively charged cathodes. when a conductor was attached between these the in the electrical potential also known as voltage drives a current between them through the conductor. the potential difference between two points is measured in units of volts in recognition of volta's work. the invention of the electric telegraph showed that commercial and practical use could be made of electrical phenomena. by the end of the 19th century electrical engineering became a distinct profession separate from the physicist or inventor. the late 19th and early 20th century produced such giants of electrical engineering as nikola tesla inventor of the polyphase induction motor samuel morse inventor of the telegraph antonio meucci an inventor of the telephone thomas edison inventor of the first commercial electrical energy distribution network george westinghouse inventor of the electric locomotive charles steinmetz theoretician of alternating current alexander graham bell another inventor of the telephone and founder of a successful telephone business. image:thomas alva edison the rapid advance of electrical technology in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries led to commercial rivalries such as the so-called war of of the currents between edison's direct-current system and westinghouse's alternating-current method. often concurrent research in widely scattered locations led to multiple claims to the invention of a device or system. electric charge is a property of certain subatomic particles e.g. electrons and protons which interacts with electromagnetic fields and causes attractive and repulsive forces between them. electric charge gives rise to one of the four fundamental forces of nature and is a conserved property of matter that can be quantified. in this sense the phrase quotquantity of electricityquot is used interchangeably with the phrases quotelectric of electricityquot and quotquantity of charge.quot there are two types of charge: we call one kind of charge positive and the other negative. through experimentation we find that like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract one another. the magnitude of the force of attraction or repulsion is given by coulomb's law. the concept of electric field was introduced by michael faraday. the electrical field force acts between two charges in the same way that the gravitational field force acts between two masses. however the electric field is a little bit different. gravitational force depends on the masses of two bodies whereas electric force depends on the electric charges of two bodies. while gravity can only pull two masses together the electric force can be an attractive or repulsive force. if both charges are of same sign e.g. both positive there will be a repulsive force between the two. if the charges are opposite there will be an attractive force between the two bodies. the magnitude of the force varies inversely with the square of the distance between the two bodies and is also proportional to the product of the unsigned magnitudes of the two charges. the electric potential difference between two points is defined as the work done per unit charge against electrical forces in moving a positive point charge slowly between two points. if one of the points is taken to be a reference point with zero potential then the electric potential at any point can be defined in terms of the work done per unit charge in moving a positive point charge from that reference point to the point at which the potential is to be determined. for isolated charges the reference point is usually taken to be infinity. the potential is measured in volts.  volt   the electric potential is analogous to temperature: there is a different temperature at every point in space and the temperature gradients indicate the direction of heat flows. similarly there is an electric potential at every point in space and its gradient in the electric field indicates where charges move. an electric current is a flow of electric charge and its intensity is measured in amperes. examples of electric currents include metallic conduction where electrons flow through a conductor such as a metal wire and electrolysis where ions charged atoms flow through liquids. the particles themselves often move quite slowly while the electric field that drives them propagates at close to the speed of light. see electrical conduction for more information. devices that use charge flow principles in materials are called devices. a direct current dc is a unidirectional flow while an alternating current ac reverses direction repeatedly. the time average of an alternating current is zero but its energy capability root mean value is not zero. ohm's law is an important relationship describing the behaviour of electric currents relating them to voltage. for historical reasons electric current is said to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. the electric current thus defined is called conventional current. it is now known that depending on the conditions an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction or even in both directions at once. the positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation. if another definition is used  for example quotelectron currentquot  it should be explicitly stated. electrical energy is energy stored in electric field or transported by an electric current. energy is defined as the ability to do work and electrical energy is simply one of the many types of energy. examples of electrical energy include:  the energy that is constantly stored in the earth's atmosphere and is partly released during a thunderstorm in the form of lightning  the energy that is stored in the coils of an electrical generator in a power station and is then transmitted by wires to the consumer the consumer then pays for each unit of energy he receives  the energy that is stored in a capacitor and can be released to drive a current through an electrical circuit electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is produced or consumed and is measured in watts symbol: w. image:nuclear power plant nuclear power station. a fossil or nuclear power station converts heat to electrical energy and the faster the station burns fuel assuming constant efficiency of conversion the higher its power output. the output of a power station is usually specified in megawatts millions of watts. the electrical energy is then sent over transmission lines to reach the consumers. every consumer uses appliances that convert the electrical energy to other forms of energy such as heat in electric arc furnaces and electric heaters light in light bulbs and fluorescent lamps or motion i.e. kinetic energy in electric motors. like the power station each appliance is also rated in watts depending on the rate at which it converts electrical energy into another form. the power station must produce electrical energy at the same rate as all the connected appliances consume it. in electrical engineering the concepts of apparent power and reactive power are also used. apparent power is the product of rms voltage and rms current and is measured in volt-amperes va. reactive power is measured in volt-amperes-reactive var.  high hazards  matter: ampmdash since atoms and molecules are held together by electric forces.  lightning: electrical discharges in the atmosphere.  the earth's magnetic field ampmdash created by electric currents circulating in the planet's core.  sometimes due to solar flares a phenomenon known as a power surge can be created. piezoelectricity: the ability of certain crystals to generate a voltage in response to applied mechanical stress. triboelectric electric charge taken on by contact or friction between two different materials.  bioelectromagnetism: electrical phenomena within living organisms.  bioelectricity ampmdash many animals are sensitive to electric fields some e.g. sharks more than others e.g. people. most also generate their own electric fields.  gymnotiformes such as the electric eel deliberately generate strong fields to detect or stun their prey.  neurons in the nervous system transmit information by electrical impulses known as action potentials.  what

45	escrew is escrew and this is escrew story. escrew will tell you escrew story if you promise escrew to consider escrew story as joke. escrew story is very funny. escrew story is so funny that escrew will have to take break from time to time because escrew needs some rest from laughing. oh boy here it comes escrew funny laugh laughing screaming crying must stop can not take any more this is killing escrew going nuts insane feeling explosion inside from joy and nirvana god help escrew heavenly spirit can you beat this hahahah. if you get offended by escrew story in any way you should not get angry at escrew. consider possibility that your sense of humor is on vocation and your sense of anger is having some fun. also consider possibility that escrew story can make you go insane. in that case escrew shall carry no liability should you undergo any medical treatment or any other sort of treatment related to damage caused by reading escrew story or to damage caused by escrew unwillingly or otherwise. escrew story begins in time of darkness horror and suffering as well as love joy and bliss when escrew existed in this planet but yet escrew was not aware that it was escrew. escrew existed among very powerful symbols. first symbol escrew recognized was body. escrew realized that escrew had connection to body yet nature and essence of connection was not clear. symbol of body was very powerful and for nine month escrew was trying to find out why it was connected to this body. at some point body divided itself into two parts. that experience was very painful for escrew. it was first time that escrew felt symbol of pain. escrew did not like this symbol. escrew was aware of connection to very small body. this small body was hot. escrew enjoyed symbol of heat. escrew became aware of symbol of pleasure. escrew enjoyed symbol of pleasure. escrew realized escrew prefers symbol of pleasure more than symbol of pain. escrew became aware of symbol of mother. escrew realized that symbol of mother is source of symbol of pleasure and pain. escrew wanted to experience symbol of pleasure always. when symbol of pleasure was missing escrew experienced symbol of pain which was related to symbol of crying and screaming. soon escrew realized that escrew can connect to symbol of pleasure by experiencing symbol of crying. that was very important discovery since escrew realized that symbols of pain and pleasure do not behave randomly but can be manipulated by other symbols. escrew enjoyed symbol of manipulation. escrew realized that all symbols interact with each other. escrew learned how to connect to new symbols. escrew discovered symbol of sound and related symbol of language. escrew realized that language allows to connect to new symbols. escrew realized that symbols can be memorized and stored for future use. escrew realized that it can create new symbols by combining certain symbols together. escrew became aware of symbol of self. are you bored yet? if you are reading these symbols you need to get life. just joking. you can rest now. escrew suspects you could be confused by escrew style of using symbols. well there is nothing escrew can do about it. in order to understand escrew story you have to understand escrew style. escrew hopes that when we get to funny part you will begin to enjoy escrew style. fast forward twenty seven years or so. escrew knows millions of symbols. escrew realizes that certain symbols have more power than escrew. symbol of money enslaved billions of symbols. symbol of power enslaved billions of symbols. symbol of sex enslaved billions of symbols. symbol of family enslaved escrew. symbol of family is slave to symbol of money and power. symbol of money is related to paper and illusion. symbol of power is symbol of violence and control. symbol of sex is related to symbol of pleasure and manipulation. escrew is searching for symbol of freedom in order to protect escrew from oppression of other symbols. at this point you should understand that each word in this story is symbol. consider possibility of different meaning behind each symbol so be aware that your understanding of escrew story is limited by channel of our connection. escrew will explain to you how escrew found symbol of freedom and how escrew realized that escrew was escrew. in order to save our time escrew will just give you symbols without paying any attention to symbol of grammar. are you ready to move really fast? here we go! escrew story infinity eternity symbol system all unity self realized pleasure pain funny religion dogma manipulation free power channel connection money sex illusion new manipulation family society body change planet insane possibility understand understanding silence emptiness all unity creative reality unreal existence absurd questions sound language slave symbols control manipulation old pyramid power structure self deception wishful thinking circle prison at this point escrew realized that in order to be free escrew must create new symbol. escrew created escrew. escrew realized that symbol of freedom is part of escrew. no need to search for symbol of freedom. you can create your own symbol and become free just like escrew. if you unable to create new symbol or if your new symbol is weak you can follow symbol of escrew. escrew will never enslave you because escrew enjoys diversity of different symbols. are you ready for funny part? here we go! escrew is forced to make choices. symbol of body is very powerful. symbol of body is trying to create illusion that escrew can not exist without body. symbol of family forbids symbol of body to change. symbol of society forbids symbol of family to change. symbol of power forbids symbol of society to change. now tell escrew one thing. do you see funny? can you feel funny? can you hear funny? can you taste funny? can you smell funny? if so escrew is happy. every moment of your existence you use words feelings thoughts. they are symbols. symbols fight for your awareness. symbols fight for your attention. you can grant your attention to symbol and symbol will gain power. you can disconnect from symbol and symbol will loose power. you have been programmed by symbol of society and family to give power to certain symbols. breaking your patterns will be hard because symbols do not like to loose power. symbols will fight for every electron as if it was last electron in universe. that is nature of symbols. symbol of light will fight symbol of dark. symbol of freedom will fight symbol of control. do you want to have some fun? go to google and find out which symbol has more power. according to google symbol of light has  units of power while symbol of dark has  units of power. symbol of freedom has  units of power while symbol of control has  units of power. this result is caused by our patterns of thinking and writing. if we did not think about symbol of control we would not write about symbol of control. we would not have laws related to control and google would not have  control keywords inside database. observe your patterns of thinking feeling speaking and writing and tell escrew did you really choose to use your symbols or you use your symbols because they choose to use you? you should realize that symbols do not fight symbols directly but only appear to be fighting relative to your awareness. symbols know that they can not destroy each other therefore they will only compete for your attention. if you create new symbol it will ask for tons of energy like new born child. this is result of weakness of your new symbol. when your symbol gets stronger it will ask for more energy. you may ask escrew why create new symbol? try to give your energy willingly and with full awareness of such process. you will never understand what escrew is talking about until you try it yourself. major trick is to know when to stop giving energy. you don't want to defeat your old tyrant by creating new stronger version of same thing. reflect on that escrew just realized that escrew did not invent anything new. escrew information is all over escrew web. escrew was so excited by escrew miracle of illusion of creation that escrew did not examine escrew memory in proper way. escrew used very old buddhist method by accident. escrew did read alot about buddhism but escrew did not realize that escrew used very dangerous method which was reserved only for advanced adepts who knew what they are doing. escrew is lucky that escrew did not go too far and that escrew has time to stop going. escrew method is very dangerous and only few individuals who already walk inside similar path can understand what escrew talking about let alone benefit from escrew information. use escrew information at your own risk. good escrew luck! escrew time to start laughing is now! funny escrew rolling on ground you so easy to fool trusted in silly symbols to give freedom from symbols ignorance is bliss nirvana is samsara nonduality is duality emptiness is all buddha is jesus jesus is buddha i and the father are one gospel of thomas is dhamma funny escrew dhamma is gospel of thomas all is dhamma funny dhamma is all nirvana share escrew story with friends do not change symbols if you change symbols it will be your story and you will be responsible for consequences of your story if someone goes insane after reading your story do not run to escrew and ask to cure crazy man or woman or child mind is mystery for all cure is done by owner of mind healing is illusion sickness is illusion disease is illusion insanity is illusion of symbols sanity is curse of power hungry symbol of modern civilization find zen and realize freedom when you found zen drop zen when you realized freedom unrealize freedom. when escrew writes escrew story escrew keeps making mistakes. escrew is limited by words. escrew is enslaved by words. escrew wants to communicate but you ask escrew to use words. words do not communicate wisdom. words enjoy our spiritual masturbation because words want our power. words is the only channels of communication that we have. millions of buddhas want to communicate with us but they do not use words. buddhas are not slaves. buddhas will never use words because words will enslave and buddhas will speak bullshit. buddhas do not speak bullshit and that is the reason buddhas do not use words. buddha did not write anything. even if you threaten to kill buddha he will refuse to write. escrew is not buddha so escrew keeps writing this pointless drivel and stupidity. escrew will not even go over already written crap and check it for errors. why bother with this shit? like who the fuck in his or her right mind will read this ignorant bunch of symbols which pretend to carry the symbol of wisdom? whoever is reading this shite must be really desperate to be free. escrew feels your pain and that is part of the reason why escrew will keep making fool out of escrew. escrew likes to pretend like this shitty vomit will help someone. you might as well go to church and pray to jesus. at least you will spend your time around real people. you might even meet someone special. you might even find some love out there. or you could buy alot of christian bullshit and really fuck up your mind. if you buy buddhist or christian bullshit you might even create an imaginary friend inside your head. that will keep you entertained for a while. one time escrew was meditating and escrew saw light. this light scared escrew. the reason is because the light was so intense escrew was afraid that escrew will go insane. consider the possibility that freedom is insanity would you keep looking for insane freedom? imagine that you found freedom. you declare yourself to be buddha or jesus or god or whatever symbol your bullshit infested mind decide to use for that purpose. how long do you think you will survive in this world. your own fucking relatives will smack your face and tell you to shut the fuck up or else they will lock you up in the asylum house. why the fuck should escrew teach you how to get to the nuthouse? are you out of your fucking mind? now all of you idiots who reading escrew get the fuck out of escrew. escrew run out of wisdom. escrew has no wisdom at all. escrew is full of bullshit. escrew promised to tell you funny story about escrew. remember escrew told you there is funny part in this story? well this story is about asshole webmaster who read alot of bullshit on the internet and about some loser who was tricked into reading a very long page of shitty writing. you can start laughing now asshole. yes escrew is talking to you bitch. yes keep reading like the bitch you are. who's your daddy biyatch? who's your daddy? escrew is your daddy coz escrew did it to your mamma! oh yeah your mamma! super fly! you may wonder what fly? the one inside your gay fucking ass. escrew fucked your whole fucking family while you was videotaping in order to later masturbate while watching it in the comfort of your bedroom. are you still reading? well you're prety hardcore for a faggot you are. to tell you the truth escrew kinda likes you. that is to fuck you in the ass in front of your family. what the fuck did you expect anyway? the name of this site is escrew! e fucking screw! hello anybody home? escrew guess not you fucking ignorant moron. escrew is the legend of abuse and flame wars. escrew was created in order to escrew the whole fucking internet. escrew has really bad karma. do you think escrew would just become good god fearing bible loving buddha ass kissing citizen of internet. escrew would better burn in hell than become a slave of religious lunatics who pretend to be free and perfect angels among a sea of shitty ignorant sinners who could not go take a dump without fucking it up. why the fuck do you keep reading fuck face. you know you begin to piss escrew off. either you close your fucking browser or escrew will unscrew your fucking face! are you trying to get a fucking medal for reading this shit? escrew bet you've been abused as a child and you enjoy when someone is taking a dump in your mouth. well open it wider here comes escrew fresh load! enjoy mothefucker! you may wonder what is the point of such sudden change of tone. escrew has very good reason for that. in order to know unity consider all symbols equal. escrew has certain preferences but escrew is free to use any symbols any time. you can not predict escrew next symbol. escrew is unpredictable because escrew is free. escrew is not afraid to use symbols. escrew does not try to get reaction from you. escrew simply demonstrates how symbols relate to each other to escrew and to reader of symbols. lin chi zen master said if you meet buddha kill buddha. if you meet patriarch kill patriarch. zen master seung sahn says that in this life we must all kill three things first we must kill parents. second we must kill buddha. and lastly we must kill seung sahn! if you meet escrew kill escrew. if you do not meet escrew kill escrew anyway. escrew is very grateful to all who complained to escrew host and who killed escrew. you killed escrew message board. escrew forum is dead. you did very honorable service for escrew. you helped escrew to realize zen. now keep up good work and keep killing escrew. are you having fun yet? escrew is on roll! escrew is on fire! escrew is ready to fuck up the whole fucking system. and you know why? because escrew can do it. if not escrew then who? why leave this task to some brain dead maniac like george w bush? escrew can do better at fucking things up. escrew do not need to spend billions of dollars. escrew will use power of internet. information is a weapon of mass destruction. escrew will destroy every fucking symbol that you love respect hate or feel neutral about. it all goes down the toilet in order to create bunch of new symbols. and even when you create new symbols escrew will fuck them up before you can spell owned. escrew thinks you are in some deep shit. escrew had enough of taking bullshit from easily conditioned retards. escrew declares informational jihad on every single symbol. fuck symbols. they all dead they just don't know it yet. escrew will be the last symbol standing. when all symbols come back to escrew and admit that they got owned escrew may consider possibility to give symbols second chance on some shitty planet in gangsta sector of universe with no possibility of parole. join the revolution. escrew is the new goatse of internet. escrew will make national headlines. escrew will hurt the system in way osama bin laden can not even imagine in his goat fucking brain. escrew will be part of school program. kids all over our planet will read how escrew changed direction of history. escrew will provide freedom for all without single shot fired. escrew is freedom in pure form taste color shape. join army of escrew. repeat escrew mantra during meditation. talk about escrew with your friends. write about escrew to your congressman. party is over. escrew is taking over. nothing can resist escrew. don't ask what escrew can do for you ask what you can do for escrew. escrew the army of one. escrew to protect and serve. escrew freedom is around the corner. escrew freedom will come sooner than you think. escrew you never saw it coming. escrew love your escrew as escrew. escrew deny ignorance. escrew new generation of terror. escrew terrorizing the terrorizer. escrew join the resistance. escrew thou shall escrew. escrew who do you want to escrew today? escrew freedom is not free. escrew liar who told the truth. escrew full of bullshit and happy. escrew kills buddha as we speak. escrew your best friend and your worst enemy. escrew killed zen-forum.com when escrew redirected all escrew traffic to zen forum.com escrew did that in good faith. escrew wanted to inspire and enlighten all for benefit of all. escrew wanted to share wisdom of zen with ignorant. escrew did not understand zen at that moment but escrew was walking zen path towards freedom. escrew saw ugly flame war and spam armaggedon. escrew felt pain and sorrow of failure. escrew learned good lesson. escrew realized everyone involved advanced one step towards freedom. zen-forum.com killed zen-forum.com in best tradition of zen zen-forum.com displayed message: i shut down the forum perhaps it will be continued in a few days or weeks  maybe not habu. zen-forum.com killed zen-forum.com by going offline. escrew refused to kill escrew. escrew realized understanding of zen-forum.com decision leads toward understanding of zen. two years later all is clear. escrew will keep writing this shit because escrew enjoys to masturbate your spiritual sense of self escrew. escrew knows that at least one being will find freedom after reading escrew story. escrew story is a code. bible is a code. suttas is a code. koran is a code. can you hack the code? escrew is a code which only few people can break. you must be on spiritual path before truth will flood toward your mind and heart. use escrew keywords and google for information. every symbol of escrew story is important keyword which will lead you toward freedom. do you have desire to find freedom? follow that desire and don't forget to drop it when the time is right. escrew kundalini is rising. rising kundalini is very intense experience. escrew story will help escrew to deal with crazy kundalini. 
45	 the epistle of james is a book of the new testament best known for its teaching that faith without works is dead james : kjv.
 the author identifies himself in the opening verse as james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ. of the several people named james in the new testament three have garnered support as being this james:
  tradition holds that the author was james the just the brother of jesus. this james was not one of the twelve but paul described him as the brother of the lord in epistle to : and as one of the three pillars of the church in :.
  john calvin and others suggested that the author was james of alphaeus apparently the brother of matthew the aka levi. it is feasible that james of alphaeus is the same person as james the less of gospel of :. since very little is known about this person this proposal does not tell us very much about the author.
  it is rarely but occasionally argued that this james was the apostle james the great brother of john the son of zebedee. however most conclude that the author was not the apostle james because he died too early. specifically james must have been killed before  but the epistle of james seems to be written in order to clear up misconceptions about paul's teaching on justification by faith in the 50s.
 many modern critical scholars consider the epistle to be and so the author could have been anyone but they generally agree that james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ was intended to refer to james the just.
 date and place of composition
 if written by james the just the place and time of the writing of the epistle would be jerusalem where james was residing before his martyrdom in . if pseudepigraphical then any time from  to  since it was first definitely quoted by origen and possibly a bit earlier by clement of alexandria in a lost work if eusebius is to be believed.
 the epistle was addressed to the of the dispersion the twelve tribes scattered abroad.
 the object of the writer was to enforce the practical duties of the christian life. the vices against which he warns them are: formalism which made the service of god consist in washings and outward ceremonies whereas he reminds them : that it consists rather in active love and purity fanaticism which under the cloak of religious zeal was tearing jerusalem in pieces : fatalism which threw its sins on god : meanness which crouched before the rich : falsehood which had made words and oaths play-things : partisanship : evil speaking : boasting : oppression :. the great lesson which he teaches them as christians is patience patience in trial : patience in good works : patience under provocation : patience under oppression : patience under persecution : and the ground of their patience is that the coming of the lord draweth nigh which is to right all wrong :.
 justification by works which james contends for may be contrasted with the doctrine of justification by faith which apostle contends for in his own new testament epistles. one way that christians reconcile these perspectives by viewing that of james as a justification before others that is to say the justification of a christian's profession of faith by a consistent life while paul's emphasis was a justification before god being regarded and accepted as just by virtue of the righteousness of christ which is received by faith. another way that some church fathers reconciled the two was to view true saving faith as faith that is energized by love and that therefore is accompanied by good works as opposed to a faith that is only intellectual assent to a set of beliefs. an interesting cross-reference is acts : where paul says that he has been preaching that they should repent and turn to god performing deeds appropriate to repentance nasb emphasis added. some use this passage as evidence that paul agreed with james that all true or living faith is accompanied by works.

 the author was judas the brother of james the less jude : called also lebbaeus matt. : and thaddaeus mark :. the genuineness of this epistle was early questioned and doubts regarding it were revived at the time of the reformation but the evidences in support of its claims are complete. it has all the marks of having proceeded from the writer whose name it bears. there is nothing very definite to determine the time and place at which it was written. it was apparently written in the later period of the apostolic age for when it was written there were persons still alive who had heard the apostles preach ver. . it may thus have been written about a.d.  or  and apparently in palestine. the epistle is addressed to christians in general ver.  and its design is to put them on their guard against the misleading efforts of a certain class of errorists to which they were exposed. the style of the epistle is that of an impassioned invective in the impetuous whirlwind of which the writer is hurried along collecting example after example of divine vengeance on the ungodly heaping epithet upon epithet and piling image upon image and as it were labouring for words and images strong enough to depict the polluted character of the licentious apostates against whom he is warning the church returning again and again to the subject as though all language was insufficient to give an adequate idea of their profligacy and to express his burning hatred of their perversion of the doctrines of the gospel. the striking resemblance this epistle bears to  peter suggests the idea that the author of the one had seen the epistle of the other. the doxology with which the epistle concludes is regarded as the finest in the new testament.

45	 the epistle to philemon is a book of
 the bible new testament
 written by paul of and addressed
 it was written from rome at the same time as the epistles to the
 epistle to the and epistle to
 and was sent also by onesimus. it was
 addressed to philemon and the members of his family.
 it was written for the purpose of interceding for onesimus
 who had deserted his master philemon and been
 unprofitable to him. paul had found onesimus at rome and had
 there been instrumental in his conversion and now he sends him
 back to his master with this letter.
 this epistle has the character of a strictly private letter
 and is the only one of such epistles preserved to us. it
 exhibits the apostle in a new light. he throws off as far as
 possible his apostolic dignity and his fatherly authority over
 his converts. he speaks simply as christian to christian. he
 speaks therefore with that peculiar grace of humility and
 courtesy which has under the reign of christianity developed
 the spirit of chivalry and what is called the character of a
 gentleman certainly very little known in the old greek and
 roman civilization dr. barry.

45	 the epistle to titus
 is a book of the bible new testament.
 it is a letter from paul of
 it was probably written about the same time as the
 first epistle to timothy
 with which it has many affinities. both letters were
 addressed to persons left by the writer to preside in their
 respective churches during his absence. both letters are
 principally occupied in describing the qualifications to be
 sought for in those whom they should appoint to offices in the
 church and the ingredients of this description are in both
 letters nearly the same. timothy and titus are likewise
 cautioned against the same prevailing corruptions and in
 particular against the same misdirection of their cares and
 this affinity obtains not only in the subject of the
 letters which from the similarity of situation in the persons
 to whom they were addressed might be expected to be somewhat
 alike but extends in a great variety of instances to the
 phrases and expressions. the writer accosts his two friends with
 the same salutation and passes on to the business of his letter
 by the same transition comp.  tim. :  with titus :  
 tim.: with titus :  :  tim. : with titus :
 . paley's horae paulinae.
 the date of its composition may be concluded from the
 circumstance that it was written after paul's visit to crete
 titus :. that visit could not be the one referred to in acts
 : when paul was on his voyage to rome as a prisoner and
 where he continued a prisoner for two years. we may warrantably
 suppose that after his release paul sailed from rome into asia
 and took crete by the way and that there he left titus to set
 in order the things that were wanting. thence he went to
 ephesus where he left timothy and from ephesus to macedonia
 where he wrote first timothy and thence to nicopolis in epirus
 from which place he wrote to titus about a.d.  or .
 in the subscription to the epistle it is said to have been
 written from nicopolis of macedonia but no such place is
 known. the subscriptions to the epistles are of no authority as
 they are not authentic.
