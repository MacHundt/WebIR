62	originally a viking fishing village founded in the 10th century copenhagen became the capital of denmark in the beginning of the 15th century. during the 17th century under the reign of christian iv it became a significant regional centre. since the turn of the millennium copenhagen has seen a strong urban and cultural development partly due to massive investments in cultural facilities and infrastructure. since the completion of the transnational resund bridge in  copenhagen has become increasingly integrated together with the swedish city of malm growing into a combined metropolitan area known as the resund region. copenhagen is the cultural economic and governmental centre of denmark it houses trade banking information industry and shipping. it is an important centre for maritime industries and maritime trade in europe offering marine transportation and shipping lanes in both the north sea and the baltic sea. copenhagen is among the financial centres of northern europe with the copenhagen stock exchange and home of many companies such as maersk carlsberg group and novo nordisk. copenhagen has  students enrolled in its educational institutions. a diverse infrastructure allows for a blend of bicycles cars and public transport while the copenhagen metro serves central copenhagen the s-train connects the outlying boroughs. the copenhagen airport is

rankings . specific rankings and related awards edit etymologythe city's origin as a harbour and a place of commerce is reflected in its name. its original designation from which the contemporary danish name is derived was kpmannhafn meaning merchants harbour. the english cognate would be chapman's haven. the english name for the city is derived from its low german name kopenhagen. the element hafnium is also named for copenhagen whose latin name is hafnia derived from the city's original name hafn harbour. the bacterium hafnia is also named after copenhagen being coined in  by vagn mller of the state serum institute in copenhagen.  edit historymain article: history of copenhagen reconstruction of copenhagen as of c. copenhagens founding has traditionally been dated to bishop absalon's construction of a castle on the small island of slotsholmen in  where christiansborg palace stands today. recent archaeological finds indicate that by the 11th century copenhagen had already grown into a small town with a large estate a church a market at least two wells and many smaller habitations spread over a fairly wide area. many historians believe that the town dates to the late viking age and was possibly founded by sweyn i forkbeard. from the middle of the 12th century it grew in importance after coming into absalon's possession who fortified it in  the year traditionally marking the foundation of copenhagen. the excellent harbour encouraged copenhagen's growth until it became an important centre of commerce. however it did not become the nation's capital until the middle of the 15th century. as the town rose in prominence it was repeatedly attacked by the hanseatic league. in  it received its charter as a city under bishop jakob erlandsen. during  it withstood a siege by the swedes under charles x and successfully repelled a major assault. in  the plague reduced copenhagen's population of about  by one-third. on  april  a british fleet under the command of admiral sir hyde parker defeated a danish-norwegian fleet anchored near copenhagen. vice-admiral horatio nelson led the main attack. he famously disobeyed parker's order to withdraw destroying many of the dano-norwegian ships before a truce was agreed. copenhagen is often considered to be nelson's hardest fought battle surpassing even the heavy fighting at trafalgar. it was during this battle that lord nelson famously put the telescope to the blind eye in order not to see admiral parker's signal to cease fire. the second battle of copenhagen or the bombardment of copenhagen  august   september  was from a british point of view a preemptive attack on copenhagen targeting the civilian population in order to seize the dano norwegian fleet. but from a danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. particularly notable was the use of incendiary congreve rockets containing phosphorus which cannot be extinguished with water that randomly hit the city. few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. the largest church vor frue kirke was destroyed by the sea artillery. several historians consider this battle was the first terror attack against a major european city in modern times. the confiscation of the navy would later source the term to copenhagenize. slotsholmen canal as seen from brsen . in the background from left to right: church of the holy ghost rundetrn trinity church st. nicholas church before the spire was rebuilt and holmen church.the british landed  men and surrounded copenhagen. the attack continued for the next three days killing some  civilians and destroying most of the city. the devastation was so great because copenhagen relied on an old defence-line whose limited range could not reach the british ships and their longer-range artillery. not until the 1850s were the ramparts of the city opened to allow new housing to be built around the lakes danish: serne that bordered the old defences to the west. this dramatic increase of space was long overdue because the old ramparts were out of date as a defence system and because of bad sanitation in the old city. before the opening central copenhagen was inhabited by approximately  people peaking in the census of   today the figure is around . in  copenhagen expanded further incorporating communities with  people and in the process making frederiksberg an enclave within copenhagen. during world war ii copenhagen was occupied by german troops along with the rest of the country from  april  until  may . the occupation was not a part of the nazi german expansion and in the first years german authorities wanted a kind of understanding with the danish government. even a general parliamentary election was granted in  with only the communist party excluded. but in august  when the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed several ships were scuttling in copenhagen harbour by the royal danish navy to prevent their use by the germans. around that time the nazis started to arrest jews although many managed to escape to sweden. after the normandy invasion the germans feared that the danish police could become a problem and in early september  the entire danish police force was meant to be arrested. but a majority of the danish police managed to either hide or escape to sweden. out of  policemen captured and deported to germany fewer than half returned after the war. during the last eight months of occupation copenhagen suffered a high rate of common criminality. ole lippman the leader of the danish resistance movement soe asked for raf assistance in attacking nazi headquarters in copenhagen. accordingly vice air marshall sir basil embry drew the plans for a spectacular precision attack on the sd and gestapo building the former office of the shell oil company. political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid so the raf had to bomb the lower levels of the building. the attack came on  march  coming in three small waves. all six planes carrying one bomb each in the first wave hit their target but unfortunately one of the aircraft crashed near frederiksberg girls school. due to this crash four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the target and aimed their bombs at the school.  civilians of which  were young girls were killed. however from the shell-building  of a total of  political prisoners managed to escape the gestapo archives were completely destroyed and hitler became so insecure of the situation that he withdrew only half of the roughly  soldiers in denmark to reinforce german forces on the rhine. since the summer of  copenhagen and the swedish city of malm have been connected by a toll resund bridge which carries railroad and automobile traffic. as a result copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area which spans both nations. the construction of the bridge has led to many changes to the public transport system and extensive redevelopment of amager south of copenhagen. in december  copenhagen hosted the worldwide climate meeting cop. when us president barack obama participated in the end of this meeting it was the fourth time an american president had visited copenhagen during his term obama also visited copenhagen in october  george w. bush in  and bill clinton in the 1990s). a typical view of copenhagen as seen from the church of our saviour. amager square part of strget seen from st. nicholas churchedit locationcopenhagen is located on the eastern shore of the island of zealand partly on the island of amager and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two. copenhagen faces the resund to the east the strait of water that separates denmark from sweden and which connects the north sea with the baltic sea. the swedish towns of malm and landskrona lie on the swedish side of the sound directly across from copenhagen. copenhagen is part of the resund region which consists of zealand lolland falster and bornholm in denmark and scania in sweden. edit copenhagen municipalitycopenhagen municipality is an administrative unit which covers the central part of the actual city of copenhagen. it is a fairly small part of the actual city which falls within the municipality both because it covers a confined area and because the enclave of frederiksberg is an independent municipality. since a reform in  copenhagen is divided into  official districts danish: bydele. official districts other areas the suffix bro in the names sterbro nrrebro vesterbro and amagerbro should not be confused with the danish word for bridge which is also bro. the term is an abbreviation or short form of the danish word brolagt meaning paved referring to the roads paved with cobblestones leading to the city's former gates. today the frederiksberg enclave whilst not part of the copenhagen municipality and so administratively independent is considered to be part of the city of copenhagen. frederiksberg became an enclave in  when the former districts of vanlse and valby were incorporated into the copenhagen municipality. these were the last incorporations to date. the highest population density is no longer found in the city centre as residential housing has been overtaken by office buildings department stores government buildings etc. instead the highest population density is found in the districts immediately surrounding the city centre where there is a density of  inhabitants per km e.g. at nrrebro and parts of sterbro and frederiksberg. the lowest population density in the municipality exists in a part of the amager vest district. at the western coast of the island of amager a large area was embanked from the shallow strait of kalveboderne in the 1930s. the main reason was to provide an occupation for unemployed workers during the great depression.citation needed as the area was later used as a military training area the ground contained unexploded ammunition for decades which hampered urban development. in the 1980s, most of the embankment was declared a nature reserve and thus remains uninhabited although a part now makes up the restad quarter. also a golf course has been established a few kilometres from the city centre. the area of copenhagen has also grown in other places as a result of land reclamation. thus all of the present and former harbour areas were gained from the sea and on eastern amager a new beach park with an artificial island was opened in . edit greater copenhagenfurther information: urban area of copenhagen districts in copenhagenthe conurbation of copenhagen consists of several municipalities. after copenhagen municipality the second largest is frederiksberg municipality an enclave inside copenhagen municipality. both are contained in the larger capital region of denmark containing most of the urban area of copenhagen. however danish road authority vejdirektoratet still uses the name greater copenhagen storkbenhavn. this area had around . million inhabitants in the mid 1990s. previously the areas of frederiksberg gentofte and copenhagen municipalities have been used to define the city of copenhagen. this definition is now obsolete. to meet statistical needs upon the latest municipal reform which took place in early  a definitory concept of danish lands danish: landsdele was introduced. a land is basically a geographical and statistical definition and the area is not considered to be an administrative unit. the land of copenhagen city includes the municipalities of copenhagen dragr frederiksberg and trnby with a total population of  at the start of . copenhagen and frederiksberg were two of the three last danish municipalities not belonging to a county. on  january  the municipalities lost their county privileges and became part of the copenhagen capital region. edit finger plansuburban copenhagen or the copenhagen metropolitan area is planned according to the finger plan danish: fingerplanen initiated in  dividing the suburbs into five fingers. the s-train lines are built according to the finger plan while green wedges and highways are built between the fingers. snowy copenhagen scenecopenhagen is in the oceanic climate zone. as the city is in the path of atlantic low-pressure systems copenhagen experiences unstable and changing weather patterns in all four seasons as well as temperatures about  degrees higher than average for its latitude  degrees north worldwide. the main reason for this warmth is the atlantic gulf stream which moves warm water from around the gulf coast area toward europe and the low-pressure systems follow with the oceanic stream. precipitation is moderate throughout the year with a small peak during june to august. snowfall occurs mainly from late december until early march but snow cover seldom lasts long. rain during january and february is as common as snow and the average temperatures for these two winter months is near the freezing point. during winter the weather is dependent on which latitude the atlantic low pressure centre takes. with a stable high-pressure system around the alps the low pressure from the southwest moves toward southern scandinavia and northern germany producing above-freezing temperatures day and night. when a stable high-pressure system sits over denmark or the lands to the northeast such as finland or russia the mild atlantic winds from the southwest are blocked allowing polar winds to cover the area and the temperature dips to below freezing rarely below  c  f during the day and  c  f during the night. if the european continent experiences cold due to the eastern russian winds which rarely occurs it can freeze from the south.citation needed this was a phenomenon that took several centuries to understand. spring is comparable to continental europe but delayed about a week because of the cold surrounding water. on the other hand in late autumn copenhagen is kept milder due to the same factor but reversed. in late november and december the surrounding ocean water is generally warmer than the air. from mid-october to february one or two storms occur. storms in the summertime are rare. summer is a mixture of southwestern mild windy and rainy low-pressure systems and periods of stable high pressures. in summer high-pressure systems usually bring sunny and fairly warm weather. but these warm periods which can occur any time from late april until mid september usually last no longer than ten days.citation needed hideclimate data for copenhagen

built-up urban area of copenhagen this means the number of communities included in this statistical abstract has changed several times in the abstracts latest edition with about . million   inhabitants. statistics denmark has never specified the geographical area of urban copenhagen. however we know it consists of copenhagen municipality frederiksberg and  of the  municipalities in the old counties copenhagen and roskilde though  of them only partially. statistics denmark has worked out definitions of so-called lands landsdele a definition used to meet statistical needs on a lower level than regions. from this the land of copenhagen city kbenhavn by is defined by the municipalities of copenhagen dragr frederiksberg and trnby with a total population of  as of  july . the surroundings of copenhagen is defined by another land copenhagen suburban kbenhavns omegn which includes the municipalities of albertslund ballerup brndby gentofte gladsaxe glostrup herlev hvidovre
